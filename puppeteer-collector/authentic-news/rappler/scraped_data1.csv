https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/aid-funding-cuts-child-vaccinations-disruption-united-nations/,"Aid funding cuts disrupt child vaccinations almost as much as pandemic, says UN","LONDON, United Kingdom – Global aid funding cuts, led by the United States, are disrupting efforts to vaccinate children against deadly diseases almost as much as the COVID-19 pandemic did, the United Nations said on Thursday, April 24.
Outbreaks of infectious diseases, including measles, meningitis and yellow fever, have been increasing globally.
Emergency and routine vaccinations meanwhile were significantly affected in nearly half of countries at the start of April due to the funding cuts, according to reports from World Health Organization offices in 108 largely low and lower-middle income countries.
Cuts to funding also reduced vaccine supplies and hampered disease surveillance, the WHO and UNICEF said in a joint release with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
“Setbacks (are) at a similar level to what we saw during COVID-19. We cannot afford to lose ground in the fight against preventable disease,” said Catherine Russell, UNICEF executive director.
COVID-19 caused what was called the largest backslide in childhood vaccination in a generation, and aid funding cuts, led by the US — formerly the world’s largest donor — risked the same outcome, the joint release said.
They called for funding for childhood immunization to be maintained ahead of Gavi’s funding round, which will be launched in June. The group is seeking $9 billion for its work from 2026-2030.
Sania Nishtar, Gavi’s chief executive officer, said it was possible to fight the rise of infectious diseases but only if the group is fully funded.
Measles cases have increased year-on-year since 2021, while meningitis surged in Africa last year and yellow fever cases also rose after declines in the last decade, the agencies said.
Last month, an internal U.S. government document showed it would follow its cuts to UNICEF and the WHO, part of wider plans to streamline and focus foreign aid to align with the “America First” policy, by cancelling its contribution of around $300 million annually to Gavi.
Last week, the U.S. State Department told Reuters it had nominated Mark Lloyd, assistant administrator for global health, to Gavi’s 28-person board. The U.S. seat had previously been vacant.
Both the US State Department and Gavi declined to comment about what this could mean for US funding.",Reuters,"Apr 24, 2025 3:23 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/bad-heart-covid-19-take-longer-heal/,"Broken heart takes long to heal; bad heart, COVID-19, even longer","Burnham Park in May 2020 was lush and pristine. The flowering plants around the lake threatened to take over the path, and the grass was knee-high.
Three months after the lockdown, the city was trying to open up. Runners and casual joggers had the same thought then: the air was crisper, and it was time to return to running.
One of the runners I got acquainted with then was Gerry. He always wore reflectorized shorts, and you knew he smiled a lot despite the face mask (and face shield) we had to wear, even while running. We also had to impose our distance on each other, so the book The Loneliness of a Long-Distance Runner rang true. Runners also spread the unfounded theory at that time that you could get COVID-19 from someone running directly behind you, so everybody ran on different lanes.
After two months, Gerry decided to take off his face mask and face shield while running because it interfered with his breathing. But he still ran regularly. In December 2020, I started not to spot Gerry at the Burnham Oval and later heard he got COVID.
We saw each other again more than a year later. Gerry told me about his stay in that eerie abandoned hospital that was converted into a quarantine area. A mild hypochondriac, Gerry decided to stay fit to avoid hospitalization again.
But in 2024, I heard that Gerry had an ischemic stroke. Knowing of his physical regimen, it took me aback. I remembered him telling me about his father dying of a heart attack, but he wasn’t yet taking heart medications.
Later, I would hear other stories like Gerry’s: mostly men who contracted COVID-19 and then had MACE or massive adverse cardiac events, like myocardial infarction, stroke, and even mortality.
Data compiled by the Center for Health Development of the Department of Health – Cordillera showed that hypertension and heart disease are among the top three comorbidities among confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. CHD compiled the report from March 2020 to January 2025.
Hypertension is first, with a total of 12,543 cases from 2020 to 2025. Diabetes is a far second with 4,232, and third is heart disease with 2,680. The fourth is asthma, with 2,012, and the fifth is cancer, with 1,695. Rounding up the top ten are chronic kidney disease (918), lung disease (604), genito-urinary disease (288), pneumonia (227) and gastrointestinal disease (223).
Hypertension accounted for half of the comorbidities of all 25,422 positive COVID-19 cases. If we include heart diseases, both will account for 60%. Most of the cases involving hypertension (7,545) occurred in 2021, when the deadly Delta variant was raging, and in 2022 (3,647 cases) when the less deadly Omicron came at the onset of that year.
It was understandable that only 578 COVID-19 cases involving hypertension occurred in 2020 because of the health restrictions the city imposed.
But more telling are the cases after the danger seemed to be over. In 2023, there were still 549 COVID-19 cases with hypertension as a comorbidity (out of the total 1,503 cases that year) and 224 cases (out of the total 547) in 2024.
The World Health Organization declared the end of COVID-19 as early as May 2023, but its effects seemed to linger far beyond that. Why does the virus seem to linger?
In October 2024, a study was published in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology, which showed that those who were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 infections, especially from the first wave of the pandemic, could double the risk of heart attack and stroke.
The study, which has the title “COVID-19 is a Coronary Artery Disease Risk Equivalent and Exhibits a Genetic Interaction with ABO Blood Type,” has been quoted by many newspapers and TV outlets because the study said that the risk for heart attacks and strokes for COVID-19-positive patients could last for up to three years.
In our email query with Hooman Allayee, PhD, the study leader and a professor of population and public health sciences at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles, he said that their study would mean that effective heart disease prevention strategies should be employed for patients who have had severe COVID-19.
“Cardiovascular mortality trends from 2010 to 2019 were steadily going down. Then, between 2020 and 2022, there was a catastrophe,” he said.
The study analyzed data from 10,000 people enrolled in the UK Biobank, an extensive biomedical database of European patients. At the time of enrollment, patients aged 40 to 69 included 8,000 who had tested positive for the COVID-19 virus and 2,000 who were hospitalized with severe COVID-19 between Feb. 1, 2020, and Dec. 31, 2020. As no vaccines were developed at that time, none of the patients were vaccinated.
According to the study, the likelihood of heart attack, stroke and mortality doubled for those who had been struck by COVID-19, especially in the first wave, compared to those who never had it. It is even four times higher for those who had severe COVID-19 infection and were hospitalized. This danger persisted for more than three years after the initial infection.
“The question now is whether or not severe COVID-19 should be considered another risk factor for cardiovascular disease, much like type 2 diabetes or peripheral artery disease, where treatment focused on cardiovascular disease prevention may be valuable,” Allayee said.
Although the cases involved mostly White people, the study is still significant to Filipinos because it said that blood types also make a difference.
The study said that those with blood types A, B, and AB were more vulnerable than those with Type O. Hospitalization for the disease more than doubled the risk of heart attack or stroke among patients with A, B, or AB blood types, but not in patients with O types, which seemed to be associated with a lower risk of severe COVID-19.
According to a 2009 study by the University of the Philippines Diliman, Type O is the most prevalent among Filipinos. The study (“Frequency Distribution of Blood Groups ABO, MN and Rh Factor in Philippine Cosmopolitan, Regional and the National Populations”) took samples from three areas in the country (UP Diliman, Isabela State University and the Philippine Red Cross databank) and found that Type O constituted from 44% to 41.2% of the population.
Type A constituted 32% to 25%, while Type B comprised 25.7% to 17%. Type AB is Filipinos’ least common blood type, comprising 6.78% to 5.8%.
Those who made the Biobank study found the need to vaccinate against COVID-19 and since the effect can last for more than three years, the need for booster shots is also essential for good health.
The study also inferred that the findings was only on people infected during the first wave and it is indefinite whether the risk of cardiovascular disease is likewise insistent to those who have had severe COVID-19 from 2021 onwards.
And because of this risk, treatment focused on cardiovascular disease prevention may be valuable, the study said.
I recently visited Gerry, who turned out to have Type A blood, and he has almost recovered completely from his stroke. He plans to run regularly once he is able, but he has now a regimen of anti-hypertensive medicines and treatment as well.
During our workshop with the Alliance and Partnership for Patient Innovation and Solutions (APPIS) and Novartis Healthcare Philippines, it was determined that a multi-sectoral approach is key to reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases and managing risk factors such as high cholesterol.
“Through the collaboration of medical societies, government, industry and communities, we can implement lifestyle interventions and enhance access to care focusing on prevention for a healthier future for all,” said Philippine Lipid and Atherosclerosis Society (PLAS) president Dr. Deborah David Ona.
In the Philippines, CVD is the leading noncommunicable disease, with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as the top contributor. ASCVD includes ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, which are among the top causes of death in the country. The three top risk factors of ASCVD are high systolic pressure, high-fat diet, and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C or “bad cholesterol”).
According to Joycelyn Rillorta, the coordinator of Noncommunicable Diseases at the DOH-CAR, the provinces with the highest hypertensive cases are Benguet, Kalinga and Mt. Province. Baguio City only ranked fourth.
Dr. Raul Lapitan, adult clinical cardiologist and echocardiographer at the Makati Medical Center, said managing LDL-C has become easier with new, innovative techniques.
“LDL-C levels can be controlled and potentially reduced through lifestyle changes, dietary modifications, and medication. By implementing medical interventions and making appropriate lifestyle changes, individuals can lower their LDL-C levels, thereby reducing their risk of heart attack, stroke and other associated health issues,” he said.",Frank Cimatu,"Mar 9, 2025 10:00 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/chinese-researchers-find-bat-virus-enters-human-cells-same-pathway-covid-19/,Chinese researchers find bat virus enters human cells via same pathway as COVID-19,"A newly discovered bat coronavirus uses the same cell-surface protein to gain entry into human cells as the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, raising the possibility that it could someday spread to humans, Chinese researchers have reported.
The virus does not enter human cells as readily as SARS-CoV-2 does, the Chinese researchers reported in the journal Cell, noting some of its limitations.
The scientists said that like SARS-CoV-2, the bat virus HKU5-CoV-2 contains a feature known as the furin cleavage site that helps it to enter cells via the ACE2 receptor protein on cell surfaces.
In lab experiments, HKU5-CoV-2 infected human cells with high ACE2 levels in test tubes and in models of human intestines and airways.
In further experiments, the researchers identified monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs that target the bat virus.
Bloomberg, which reported on the study earlier on Friday, said the paper identifying the bat virus had moved shares of COVID vaccine makers. Pfizer PFE.N shares closed up 1.5% on Friday, Moderna MRNA.O climbed 5.3% and Novavax NVAX.O was up about 1% on a down day for the broader market.
Asked about concerns raised by the report of another pandemic resulting from this new virus, Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, called the reaction to the study “overblown.”
He said there is a lot of immunity in the population to similar SARS viruses compared with 2019, which may reduce the pandemic risk.
The study itself noted that the virus has significantly less binding affinity to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV-2, and other suboptimal factors for human adaptation suggest the “risk of emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated.”",Reuters,"Feb 23, 2025 10:07 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/pope-francis-double-pneumonia-what-it-means/,Pope Francis has double pneumonia – what does that mean?,"LONDON, United Kingdom – Pope Francis, the 88-year-old head of the 1.4-billion-member Roman Catholic Church, is in hospital being treated for double pneumonia following a respiratory infection.
Pneumonia is inflammation of the lungs, usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The Pope has bilateral pneumonia, known informally as double pneumonia, and means both lungs are affected.
When a person has pneumonia, small sacs in the lungs called alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and restricts oxygen intake.
Symptoms can include coughing, including coughing up mucus, shortness of breath, a temperature, aches and pain, exhaustion, and confusion.
Many people recover from pneumonia in a few weeks, but a number of factors can make it more dangerous. It is often more risky for babies and adults over 65, as well as those with cardiovascular disease or pre-existing lung conditions.
The Pope is especially prone to lung infections because as a young adult he had pleurisy and part of one lung removed.
He developed pneumonia after being hospitalized last week for a respiratory infection on top of two other airway conditions, bronchiectasis and asthmatic bronchitis, a Vatican statement said on Tuesday, February 18.
Bilateral pneumonia is more serious because it affects both lungs, meaning the patient has less healthy lung capacity remaining to breathe with, doctors said.
Pneumonia is common. Alongside other lower respiratory tract infections, the World Health Organization says it is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
For example, in the United States, around one million older adults are hospitalized with pneumonia annually, and around 50,000 die, according to the American Thoracic Society.
Globally, it kills 700,000 children under the age of 5 annually, the WHO estimates.
Pneumonia can be treated with antibiotics to tackle the bacterial cause of the infection or anti-viral drugs can help fight a viral infection.
In hospital, people often get fluids and oxygen too.
The Vatican described the Pope’s initial respiratory infection as “polymicrobial,” which means it is caused by a combination of pathogens. That made it more complex to treat, and he was receiving antibiotics and corticosteroids.
He is now also getting “additional pharmacological treatment” for the pneumonia, the Vatican said.",Reuters,"Feb 19, 2025 8:12 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/things-to-know-cholesterol/,What you need to know about cholesterol — the good and the bad,"Most people know that high levels of cholesterol can be unhealthy and, in some cases, may lead to serious illness or even death.
But our body actually also produces a “good” kind of cholesterol, which helps the body process fats and “bad” cholesterol. Increased physical activity and proper diet can improve cholesterol levels in our system, too.
Here’s what you need to know.
Cholesterol is a wax-like substance (lipoprotein) that circulates through the bloodstream to bring fats to cells that need them. Most or 80% of cholesterol is produced by our liver and cells, while 20% is from the food with saturated and trans fat that we consume.
“It’s a natural part of the human body and in fact, we all need it. We need cholesterol in order to survive. Each of our cells has cholesterol as part of its structure,” endocrinologist Nemecio Nicodemus Jr. told Rappler.
Cholesterol helps with the production of cell membranes, hormones (such as testosterone, cortisol, and estrogen), and vitamin D.
Our livers usually adjust if we consume food that goes beyond the usual 20%. “But some people’s livers don’t do this well, because of their genes,” Columbia University Irving Medical Center said in a handout.
These are the different types of cholesterol found in the human body:
“Among the different kinds of fat in our body, only one is really considered as good and that is the HDL — the high-density lipoprotein — and everything else is relatively bad,” Nicodemus said.
HDL is considered the “good cholesterol” because it is the only type of cholesterol that can help the body remove extra fat and cholesterol from a person’s blood vessels and other organs. HDL brings excess cholesterol back to our liver, and the excess then exits our bodies through excretion.
It also helps prevent blood clots and helps the body with inflammation and oxidants.
“On the other hand, the other cholesterols…all of them can actually lead to deposition or deposits of cholesterol in our blood, vessels, in our muscles, in our liver,” Nicodemus said.
While cholesterol is needed by our bodies, too much of the “bad” can be fatal.
High levels of bad cholesterol can block up blood vessels, which would then affect major organs.
“If it is to the heart, it’s a heart attack. If it is to the brain, it’s a stroke,” Nicodemus said.
Nicodemus, citing studies done by the Department of Science and Technology, pointed out that the “common abnormality” among Filipinos is that most of us have low levels of good cholesterol.
“One-third of the population has high bad cholesterol,” he said. “But when you talk of the low good cholesterol, almost 70% of Filipinos have low good cholesterol levels and that is mainly genetic.”
However, since the condition affects the bloodstream, most people don’t realize there’s something wrong until it’s a bit too late.
“If your parents have heart diseases, have diabetes, then part of what they should be checking, even as a young adult, should be their cholesterol as well.”
Among misconceptions about cholesterol, for instance, is that it only affects the senior population.
A government survey from 2008, however, showed that Filipinos aged 20 to 29 years old have concerning levels of cholesterol.
Lifestyle diseases — which include heart diseases, stroke, and diabetes — also account for nearly 9 out of 10 deaths in the Western Pacific, a World Health Organization study showed. The Philippines is one of the four countries that saw an increase in deaths among people younger than 70 years old because of these diseases.
In the first half of 2023, ischemic heart disease was ranked as the top killer of Filipinos. This is caused by narrowed heart arteries, which may be caused by high levels of bad cholesterol, among others.
Individuals can keep their health in check by remembering “ACT NOW”:
To control cholesterol levels, people are encouraged to follow a healthy diet, observe weight management, and get regular exercise. Among food that should be avoided are those with saturated or trans fats.
“A low-fat diet will be important to bring the bad cholesterol down, and aside from diet, of course, weight management is very important because studies have consistently shown that people who are overweight and who have obesity are the ones who also have a lot of the circulating bad cholesterol,” Nicodemus said.
Meanwhile, to boost good cholesterol, people should increase their level of physical activity. The effect won’t be instant, although Nicodemus said “good cholesterol will already be improving slowly.”",Kaycee Valmonte,"Feb 19, 2025 5:57 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/philippines/visayas/hypertension-cases-rise-negros-occidental-health-workers-alarm/,"Hypertension cases on the rise in Negros Occidental, health workers sound alarm","NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – The numbers told a sobering story, but they barely scratched the surface of the crisis unfolding in Negros Occidental. In just two years, hypertension cases in the province skyrocketed from 4,991 in 2021 to 36,574 in 2023.
Each statistic represented a family struggling with the rising costs of health care, a household blindsided by a sudden stroke, a life upended by an avoidable crisis.
For 74-year-old Ireneo Torreno of Tabugon village in Kabankalan City, it happened just weeks before Christmas. His daughter, Cristine, found him collapsed after a long day in the fields.
The family had always known money was tight, stretching their earnings between food, farm supplies, and the occasional trip to town. Checkups were a luxury. Medication was out of reach.
“The cost of medications and follow-up care became an insurmountable obstacle,” Cristine said.
Across Negros Occidental, families like the Torrenos put off doctor visits, hoping they could hold out a little longer. But bad cholesterol and high blood pressure don’t wait. The Department of Health (DOH) warns that without immediate action, more lives will be at risk – unless the government and communities step in before it’s too late.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns that high LDL cholesterol, often called “bad cholesterol,” increases the risk of heart disease and stroke.
DOH-Negros Occidental head Adrian Ramos explained that high bad cholesterol levels cause plaque buildup in the arteries, restricting blood flow and increasing the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases.
“Many residents remain unaware of their cholesterol levels despite efforts to promote healthier lifestyles and public health education. By the time they seek medical help, their condition has often reached a critical stage,” Ramos said.
He also pointed out the challenge of low health literacy. In 2021 alone, only 35% of Filipinos had adequate health literacy.
“We aim to raise this figure to 69% for Filipinos 18 and above by 2028,” he said.
Negrosanon health care professional Melvin Sanicas stressed the need for culturally relevant health campaigns that address specific needs.
He said health programs should focus on practical, everyday steps such as promoting healthier eating habits, encouraging physical activity, and making cholesterol screenings more accessible.
Sanicas urged local governments to work with the DOH and other health organizations to develop innovative solutions, including subsidizing healthier food options and negotiating lower medication prices.
“These steps will improve access to cholesterol-lowering treatments and ease the financial burden on families,” he said.
Local governments recognize the urgency of the cholesterol crisis but struggle with limited budgets. Ramos admitted that public health funds often get divided among various priorities, leaving cholesterol management programs underfunded.
“Local health boards have included cholesterol-related programs in their agenda, but budget constraints limit their impact,” Ramos said.
He emphasized the need for more targeted investments and sustained funding to address the root causes of high cholesterol and related diseases.
Provincial Health Office officer-in-charge Dr. Girlie Pinongan said the provincial government was committed to health programs such as regular assessments, advocacy campaigns, and monthly health celebrations in partnership with the DOH.
She said they utilize the Philippine Package of Essential Non-Communicable Diseases Interventions (PhilPEN), a program designed to screen adults for risk factors such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and hypertension.
Pinongan noted that most health centers in the province can monitor residents with underlying conditions. However, she cited the persistent issue of low health-seeking behavior.
“Many people refuse to visit health centers or hospitals for checkups until they are already in the curative stage,” she said.
She also acknowledged that health coordinators struggle to reach remote areas, making checkup access difficult. Still, she encouraged residents in upland communities to visit public doctors for regular health monitoring.
“Some people think they don’t need checkups because they feel fine. But regular checkups matter because they might already have hypertension or diabetes without knowing it,” she stressed.
To remove financial barriers to health care, Pinongan clarified that they have partnered with all local governments in the province to offer free screenings. The initiative aims to address concerns about residents who avoid medical tests due to high costs.
“The saying ‘prevention is better than cure’ holds true. People must take action now rather than wait until they need expensive and difficult treatment,” she said.
In 2023, the PHO assessed 317,702 individuals in the province 20 and above and found that 16% had hypertension and diabetes. She warned that cases continue to rise and more young people are developing these conditions.
Pinongan said the public should take charge of their health, emphasizing the importance of a balanced diet.
She stressed that “eating nutritious food is vital for overall well-being” and urged people to “avoid sugary products and other harmful habits that contribute to disease.”

https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/millions-could-die-from-hiv-aids-if-united-states-funding-stops/,"6 million people could die from HIV and AIDS if US funding stops, UN agency warns","GENEVA, Switzerland – More than six million people could die from HIV and AIDS in the next four years if US President Donald Trump‘s administration pulls its global funding for programs, the United Nations AIDS agency said on Friday, February 7.
Although a waiver was placed on HIV/AIDS programs in last month’s US foreign aid funding freeze, many concerns remained about the future of treatment programs, the deputy executive director of UNAIDS told reporters in Geneva.
“There is a lot of confusion especially on the community level, how the waiver will be implemented. We’re seeing a lot of disruption of delivery of treatment services”, Christine Stegling said.
Trump put hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of foreign aid donations on hold for 90 days upon taking office on January 20. In the following days, the US State Department issued a waiver on the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) — the world’s leading HIV initiative — for life-saving humanitarian assistance.
While welcoming the waiver, Stegling stressed the situation remains chaotic.
Amid a broader decline of funding, Stegling warned there would be a 400% increase in AIDS deaths if PEPFAR financial support is not re-authorized between 2025 and 2029.
“That’s 6.3 million people, 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths that will occur in future…Any penny, any cut, any pause, will matter for all of us” she said, urging UN member states to step in.
“In Ethiopia, we have 5,000 public health worker contracts that are funded by US assistance. And all of these have been terminated,” Stegling said.
She highlighted that community clinics were facing the biggest interruption as they are “entirely dependent” on US government funding.
She expressed concern that some people may not come forward for treatment, which could in turn increase new HIV infections.
US donations account for the majority of global funding for the UN program that operates in 70 countries, leading global efforts to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.

https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/posts-hiv-infected-needles-blood-tests-hoax-doh/,FACT CHECK: Viral posts on ‘HIV-infected’ needles in blood tests a hoax – DOH,"Claim: Individuals posing as health workers are infecting people with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through contaminated needles used in blood sugar tests.
Why we fact-checked this: Several variations of the chain message are circulating on social media, with one such post receiving 38 reactions, 15 comments, and 91 shares as of writing.
The post claims to be an urgent notice from “National Intelligence” under the Office of the President. It warns the public that so-called members of the “Faculty of Medicine” are visiting houses to conduct blood sugar tests. The post further claims that these individuals are members of the Islamic State (ISIS) using needles allegedly contaminated with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
Several variations of the chain message exist, such as one claiming that the virus is spread under the guise of providing an anti-tetanus injection. Another version of the post in a different language is circulating in private chats.
The facts: The Department of Health (DOH) released an advisory stating that the viral social media posts are a hoax.
“The Department of Health (DOH) warns the public on a circulating message on social media falsely claiming to be a member of the Faculty of Medicine visiting houses for a blood sugar test,” the January 11 notice read.
“The Philippine National Police has also debunked this message, confirming that it is a scare tactic with no factual basis,” it added.
The health department also urged the public “not to share unverified claims that may cause unnecessary alarm,” and reminded them to check information from legitimate sources and platforms.
Debunked in 2018: The Philippine National Police (PNP) previously dismissed a similar chain message as a hoax in 2018. Then-PNP spokesperson Chief Supt. John Bulalacao said it was a prank designed to spread fear among the public.
In a December 2018 fact check, Rappler also debunked a similar claim that ISIS was spreading AIDS through fake vaccines at health centers.
Dubious details: The false posts that recently resurfaced online mentioned an institution called the “Faculty of Medicine” that purportedly conducts the house-to-house blood sugar tests. However, the government institution responsible for public health matters is the DOH.
Similar fact checks: Rappler has debunked other chain messages and health hoaxes. These include false claims regarding a state of emergency in China over an alleged new epidemic and the supposed declaration of mpox as a global pandemic. – Precious America/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/us-surgeon-general-2025-alcohol-cancer-study-expert-analysis/,US gov’t report finds even 1 drink a day elevates cancer risk. Here’s an expert’s analysis.,"Many people use the new year to reflect on their relationship with alcohol. Just-released government guidelines are giving Americans another reason to consider a “dry January.”
Over the past few decades, mounting scientific evidence has shown that as little as 1 to 2 alcoholic drinks per day can lead to increases in the likelihood of several cancers. This prompted the US surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, to release a new Surgeon General Advisory on January 3, 2025, warning about the link between alcohol and cancer. This report highlighted the evidence and included a call for new cancer warning labels on alcoholic beverages.
The association between alcohol and cancer isn’t new news — scientists have been trying to determine the link for decades — yet most people aren’t aware of the risks and may only associate drinking with liver disease like cirrhosis. In a 2019 survey from the American Institute for Cancer Research, less than half of Americans identified alcohol as a risk factor for cancer.
Alcohol is the third-most preventable cause of cancer in the US, putting it just behind tobacco and obesity. As the surgeon general’s report highlights, alcohol is associated with approximately 100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 cancer deaths every year, playing a role in breast, liver, colorectal, mouth, throat, esophagus and voice box cancer cases. Alcohol-induced cancer deaths outnumber alcohol-associated traffic crash fatalities every year.
The report included the suggestion to add warning labels to alcohol similar to what is already required for tobacco products — another substance of abuse known to cause cancer.
As a neuroscientist specializing in the neurobiological effects of alcohol use and binge drinking, I am glad to see the call to action for reducing alcohol consumption in the United States.
With so few people aware of the links between alcohol consumption and various cancers — and the fact that the vast majority of people consume some alcohol every week — it’s easy to see why the surgeon general is calling for greater awareness. The 22-page report highlights what scientists know about the relationship between alcohol and cancer, and suggests actions for moving forward. Those include label changes on alcohol, which have not been updated since they were created in 1988.
Somewhat strikingly, breast cancer carries a large portion of this risk — making it particularly worrisome in the face of increased alcohol use among women.
These numbers don’t only apply to heavy alcohol drinkers. While less alcohol is better, 25% of these cancer cases were in people classified as moderate drinkers — consuming, on average, fewer than two drinks per day. This means that anyone regularly drinking alcohol, even small amounts, should know about and understand the risks.
Surgeon general’s advisories are the primary way that the Department of Health and Human Services, where the Office of the Surgeon General resides, communicate health issues of great importance to the public. Surgeon general’s advisories are not necessarily breaking news, but they take the opportunity to bring public awareness to science surrounding big public health issues.
The relationship between alcohol and cancer has been clear to scientists for decades. In fact, it was highlighted in a 2016 surgeon general’s report as well, which focused on addiction more broadly.
The new report outlines the different types of evidence supporting this link. One way is through epidemiological science, which tries to understand patterns and relationships between the rates of cancer and how much alcohol people consumed. Another is through experimental animal studies, which allow scientists to understand the mechanism and causality of these connections as they apply to specific cancers. Together, studies conclusively show a link and pathway between alcohol consumption and cancer.
The surgeon general’s report highlights four key pathways through which alcohol can cause cancer. These largely focus on the ways alcohol can negatively affect your DNA, the building blocks of cells. While the healthy cells in your body divide all the time, their abnormal growth can be driven by aberrant factors like alcohol-induced DNA damage.
This DNA damage leads to uncontrollable growth of tissue instead of healthy, normal tissue growth. This abnormal tissue growth is cancer. The four pathways through which alcohol can lead to cancer highlighted in the report are:
The biggest question on people’s minds right now is likely “how much alcohol can I safely drink?” and the answer to that might disappoint you — probably none.
Alcohol use remains one of the most preventable risk factors for cancer. And even moderate alcohol consumption — one or fewer drinks per day — may elevate cancer risk for some types, such as breast, throat and mouth cancers.
But none of these studies can tell you what your individual risk for cancer is. The relationship between alcohol and cancer can be influenced by your genes, such as those that control the enzymes that metabolize alcohol, and other lifestyle factors that influence the rates of cancer broadly, like diet and inflammation. All of these lifestyle and personal health factors can influence how risky alcohol consumption is for you.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that if you choose to drink, consider sticking to less than one, for women, or two, for men, standard servings of alcohol per day — which might be smaller than you think, and don’t binge drink alcohol at all. The surgeon general is also suggesting a rethinking of these guidelines to include updated limits on daily alcohol consumption and greater educational efforts around the link between alcohol and cancer.
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has similar recommendations around limiting alcohol consumption and advises that for people who choose to drink alcohol, “the less, the better.”
The institute offers tips on its website for managing your alcohol consumption or abstaining from alcohol consumption altogether, including finding alternative hobbies and activities, identifying what leads to your urges to drink and having a plan to handle urges, and identifying a strategy for saying “no” to an alcoholic beverage in social settings.",Nikki Crowley,"Jan 12, 2025 6:39 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/explainer-how-alcohol-consumption-impacts-cancer-risk/,EXPLAINER: How alcohol consumption impacts cancer risk,"The United States Surgeon General on Friday, January 3, said all alcoholic drinks, whether beer, wine or spirits, should carry a label warning that consumption increases the risk of cancer.
A link between alcohol use and cancer has been recognized at least since 1987, when the International Agency for Research on Cancer first classified alcohol as a carcinogen to humans.
Evidence for this link from studies in humans and animals has strengthened since then, according to the Surgeon General’s report, which shows risks rising modestly along with consumption. Here is what research has shown about alcohol intake and cancer:
US dietary guidelines currently recommend two or fewer drinks per day for men and one drink or less per day for women. For certain cancers, like breast, mouth, and throat cancers, risks may start to increase around one or fewer drinks per day, the report says.
The evidence that alcohol consumption increases the risk of malignancy is strongest for cancers of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, liver, mouth, throat, and larynx.
The Surgeon General’s report highlights four ways in which alcohol consumption raises cancer risks.
The hormone-related risk for breast cancer is highlighted in the report. In addition, in the mouth and esophagus, and throughout the gastrointestinal tract, alcohol irritates and damages the protective mucosal lining that normally protects cells from carcinogens, including tobacco.
The liver processes alcohol, leading to high acetaldehyde concentrations. Chronic alcohol-induced inflammation can also lead to cirrhosis, a major risk factor for liver cancer.
Alcohol-induced inflammation can also increase the risk of pancreas cancer.
The risk of cancer increases with the level of alcohol consumption. The Surgeon General’s report estimates that an alcohol-related cancer will develop in about 10 of every 100 men who consume less than one drink per week, 11 of every 100 who average one drink daily, and in 13 of every 100 who consume two drinks daily.
Higher alcohol consumption increases breast cancer risk in women from roughly 11 cases in every 100 of those who consume less than one drink per week, to 13 cases in every 100 who consume one drink per day and 15 in every 100 who consume two drinks per day, according to the report.
Global changes in alcohol drinking patterns by region and sex — including increases in alcohol consumption by women — might account for an increase in alcohol-attributable cancer cases, a 2021 report in The Lancet Oncology suggested.
The evidence is strongest for the roles of acetaldehyde and inflammation in raising cancer risks, the report notes, while hormone regulation and alcohol as a solvent are not yet fully understood.
Each person’s risk for developing cancer, including alcohol-related cancers, is determined by a complex interaction of biological, environmental and social factors.
A January 2025 report from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concludes that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower rate of deaths from any cause compared with no consumption. While it did find links between alcohol and cancer, it also found evidence to suggest that consuming moderate amounts of alcohol is associated with lower risks for nonfatal heart attacks, nonfatal strokes, and deaths from heart disease.

https://www.rappler.com/world/africa/cash-vaccines-reward-program-child-immunization-program-nigeria/,Cash for vaccines: Reward program boosts child immunization in Nigeria,"Gombe, Nigeria: It’s 8 am on Monday, August 26, 2024, at the Pantami Primary Healthcare Centre in Pantami, a suburb in northeast Nigeria’s Gombe State. The children’s vaccination hall is filled with a vibrant array of hijab colors: green, brown, white, and more, representing a mix of young and older mothers who brought their babies and toddlers for vaccination.
Among them is 37-year-old Ashaitu Adamu, a mother of three. Inside the hall, a healthcare worker dressed in gray scrubs calls a number, and Ashaitu steps forward with her 15-month-old toddler, Fatima. The worker collects Fatima’s vaccination card, verifies it against the center’s records, and directs Ashaitu to another hall section.
There, Fatima receives her final dose of the MCV vaccine, which helps prevent the virus that causes measles in children. The World Health Organization describes measles as an airborne disease that is “highly contagious.”
But this last dose, which is also the last of the various vaccines she had been scheduled to take, means more than just disease prevention; it is also a hunger reliever for Ashaitu’s family. The dose makes Ashaitu eligible for N5,000 ($3) livelihood support.
“My husband has not received his salary, and I left the house after morning prayers. My husband will come back to see food in the house today, all thanks to this money,” she says.
By 10 am, the room still has at least 50 women with their children waiting for vaccinations.
“It hasn’t always been like this,” says Khalid Dauda Boi, the facility’s routine immunization officer, implying that mothers scarcely brought their children for vaccination until a cash incentive was introduced. “We often had to go out and persuade women to bring their children for vaccinations.”
The change from vaccine apathy among mothers to ensuring their kids are fully immunized is thanks to an initiative that rewards caregivers like Ashaitu in several northern Nigerian states for consistently ensuring full immunization of their children.
This cash support is a program of New Incentives or NI. This US-based nonprofit, founded in 2011, believes that poor families’ lack of money means they prioritize daily survival, leaving little attention to activities that improve family health or educational outcomes. It refers to its cash incentives as conditional cash transfers.
“A conditional cash transfer is a small amount of money given to somebody in need after they participate in certain activities, and that could be…preventative healthcare,” said its founder, Svetha Janumpalli.
In Nigeria, NI conducts its activities as All Babies Are Equal Initiative, a local organization founded in 2014. It works to drive child vaccination in poor communities across nine northern Nigerian states.
Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, grapples with a high burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, including meningitis, polio, and measles. A 2019 study by Gavi Zero Dose Learning Hub estimates that at least 41% of deaths among children under five in Nigeria may be vaccine-preventable.
But vaccine distrust, especially in the Muslim-dominated north, is a major obstacle to disease prevention. The hesitation is understandable, and it stems from Pfizer’s 1996 failed meningitis vaccine trial that left 11 children dead and more with permanent disabilities.
In 2003,  Muslim leaders in Kano State led a 15-month boycott of the polio vaccine. The result was a 30% surge in confirmed polio incidents in the country amid a national effort to attain a polio-free status.
Insecurity in the region has also slowed down the immunization rate. For example, nine immunization workers were shot dead in Kano by gunmen suspected to be members of Boko Haram insurgents.
According to figures from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey/National Immunization Coverage Survey, the northwest and northeast (where Gombe State is) recorded the highest numbers of unvaccinated children by 2021. The northeast, in particular, had a 27% zero-dose vaccination rate and a 49% partial vaccination rate—the highest in the country. Overall, the region had just 24% vaccination coverage, falling short of the national average of 36%.
New Incentives provides a N1000 (USD 0.60) cash incentive to eligible caregivers (parents) each time their child takes a vaccine dose as scheduled. “That encourages them to come to the facility for immunization,” said Abdurrahman Shaibu, executive director of the Gombe State Primary Health Care Development Agency.
After the final dose of the last vaccine, a caregiver receives ₦1000 and an additional ₦5000 (USD 3) for adhering to the vaccination schedule until the end.
For many women in poor communities, the absence of such incentives means they cannot afford transportation to vaccination centers, which can be a major reason for missing schedules for their babies and toddlers.
In the last decade, a cost of living crisis set off by heightened inflation has driven Nigeria’s poverty rate to a staggering 40.1%. More than 40 million women — mainly in the northern region — live in extreme poverty. In 2023, the cost of transportation in the region rose by over 90%.
“Sometimes, I wake up with no money,” said Patience Joy, a caregiver, emphasizing how she would have missed vaccination appointments if NI was not supporting her transportation costs.
Nine of the 19 northern states NI operates in are Bauchi, Gombe, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto, and Zamfara. Intervention in a new state begins with a rapid assessment, which is a “baseline survey to understand the vaccination coverage level in that area,” said Mustapha Kabir, operations coordinator for northwest and northeast.
After six months of operating in such locations, “We try to collect data to assess the level of improvement,” Kabir added.
The organization relies heavily on partnerships with local state authorities, such as the Gombe State Primary Health Care Development Agency. It also works with local chiefs and religious leaders, who wield significant powers in rural communities, to raise awareness about the benefits of vaccination.
NI clarifies that it does not provide vaccines but works to identify and address barriers to vaccination and non-compliance cases.
“Government agencies and immunization partners procure vaccines and play all active roles in the supply chain. Our role involves coordination and communication to identify and resolve supply issues and bottlenecks. All of this supportive work is carried out with our government partners at the local, state, zonal, and national levels,” it says on its website. But “We also aim to improve the quality of local healthcare facilities by ensuring proper documentation and that clinics are active and serving the required caregivers,” adds Kabir.
He said that in Gombe alone, NI has enrolled about 224,000 beneficiaries, made 797,000 disbursements amounting to about N742 million (about USD 444,358), and encouraged over three million vaccinations.
Shaibu, the director of the Gombe State Primary Health Care Development Agency, said his office uses harmonized data, community surveys, and feedback from community healthcare facilities to measure the impact of NI’s program. “The result shows a significant increase in demand for immunization across our primary healthcare facilities,” he admitted.
The secretary at the Pantami Primary Healthcare Center in Pantami, Ahmed Mohamed Bello, agreed. “The number of caregivers over the last two years has more than doubled,” he said. “Without the new incentives, we might have only seen a third of the usual turnout.”
The influx of mothers into health centers seeking vaccination has created a new problem for the centers: A shortage of healthcare workers to effectively meet the demands. And despite efforts to fight vaccine distrust, some husbands still remember the failed Pfizer incident and continue to prevent their wives and children from receiving the vaccine.
But those who have been receptive say they have evidence that the vaccines have been helpful.
“I now know the benefit of the vaccination. My children don’t have these common childhood illnesses,” Ashaitu said.","Ogar Monday, Primer Progress","Dec 28, 2024 4:00 PM PHT"

Why we fact-checked this: The video bearing the claim has gained over 211,100 views, 5,700 reactions, 270 comments, and 846 shares as of writing.
It appears to show 24 Oras anchor Mel Tiangco reporting on Ong’s alleged discovery of a hypertension cure and pharmaceutical companies’ supposed concealment of the remedy.
The post further claims that at least 34,792 Filipinos have been cured using this medicine, with Ong supposedly saying that it can eliminate hypertension within 20 to 30 hours.
The post also includes a link to purchase the alleged cure.
The facts: The video of Ong and Tiangco was manipulated using artificial intelligence (AI).
Deepfake detection tool Sensity confirmed with 98% confidence — above the 50% detection threshold — that the video was altered using face-swapping technology.
A closer look at the altered video also shows that the mouth movements of Ong and Tiangco appear unnatural.
Target of health scams: Rappler has published several fact-checks related to Ong. Many of the false claims imply his supposed endorsement of various health products, with the misleading ads using AI to manipulate videos taken from the doctor’s official social media channels.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/winners-nobel-prize-medicine-2024/,Nobel prize for medicine goes to US scientists Ambros and Ruvkun,"STOCKHOLM, Sweden – Scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation, the award-giving body said on Monday, October 7.
The Nobel assembly said in a statement that the laureates discovered the new class of tiny RNA molecules, which play a crucial role in gene regulation.
“Their groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms, including humans,” the assembly said.
The winners for medicine are selected by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden’s Karolinska Institute medical university and receive a prize sum of 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million).
As every year, the medicine prize is the first in the crop of Nobels, arguably the most prestigious prizes in science, literature, and humanitarian endeavor, with the remaining five set to be unveiled over the coming days.
Created in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel, the prizes have been awarded for breakthroughs in science, literature and peace since 1901, while economics is a later addition.
Different institutions award the prizes in the various fields, with Peace being the only one awarded in Oslo rather than Stockholm, possibly as a result of the political union that existed between the two Nordic countries when Nobel penned his will.
Last year’s medicine prize was awarded to the runaway favorites Katalin Kariko, a Hungarian scientist, and US colleague Drew Weissman, for discoveries that paved the way for COVID-19 vaccines that helped curb the pandemic.
Past winners of the Nobel medicine prize include many famous researchers such as Ivan Pavlov in 1904, most known for his experiments on behaviour using dogs, and Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 prize for the discovery of penicillin.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/how-ai-is-joining-the-fight-against-superbugs/,How AI is joining the fight against superbugs,"Invisible to the naked eye, bacteria are constantly evolving in their quest for survival.
Over the years, the misuse and overuse of antibiotics have inadvertently fuelled the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, also known as ‘superbugs’.
These superbugs are equipped with ingenious defence mechanisms, like forming castles of slime called biofilms, in which bacterial communities are well protected against attacks from antibiotics and the immune system.
In 2019, globally 1.27 million people died from antibiotic-resistant infections.
However, scientists are not backing down. They are arming themselves with cutting-edge treatment strategies and harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to combat this growing threat.
And there is global recognition of the importance of this work. In August 2023, G20 health ministers, meeting ahead of the main leaders summit in September, committed to a comprehensive strategy to continue the fight against antimicrobial resistance.
Imagine antibiotics as soldiers fighting bacteria on the battlefield.
Over time, some bacteria manage to survive the attack, passing on their resistance to their descendants.
This process, accelerated by the misuse of antibiotics in medicine, agriculture and livestock, has led to the emergence of superbugs that can resist multiple antibiotics, rendering once-effective treatments useless.
Adding to this challenge is the formation of biofilms.
By default, bacteria like to stick together and build walls of slime around them. Within this ‘slime castle‘, bacteria are extremely well protected against any enemy.
This makes bacteria in biofilms up to 1,000 times stronger in withstanding attacks from antibiotics or the immune system compared with single bacteria.
The close neighbourhood of bacteria enables them to ‘chat’ to each other, streamline defences and exchange information on how to become resistant to antibiotics.
Biofilms are involved in 80 percent of infections in the human body — such as surgical site infections, non-healing wounds and implant infections — that are extremely difficult to treat.
The scientific community recognises the urgent need for new approaches to tackle antibiotic resistance and biofilms, particularly as no new classes of antibiotics have been discovered since the 1980s.
Researchers are exploring various strategies, some of which hold promising potential:
While these innovative strategies show promise, their development and optimisation require substantial research and experimentation. This is where artificial intelligence steps in.
AI algorithms can analyze vast databases of molecular information to identify potential compounds with antibacterial properties.
By simulating interactions between drugs and bacteria, AI accelerates the drug discovery process, helping scientists uncover novel treatment options more efficiently.
Additionally, AI-driven models can simulate the behavior of biofilms and bacterial colonies, aiding researchers in designing strategies to disrupt these communities effectively.
This computational approach provides valuable insights that guide the development of treatments that can prevent persistent infections.
The race against superbugs is a race against time.
The collaborative efforts of researchers worldwide, combined with innovative treatment strategies and AI-powered insights, provide hope for a brighter future.
While science is delivering potential new treatments, responsible antibiotic use is a key part of ensuring existing treatments remain effective.
That means doctors and their patients have a role to play in ensuring only the necessary use of antibiotics, while the agricultural and food sectors also need to limit antibiotic use in livestock.
Research funding is critical, so policymakers too have a critical part in the fight.
Dr Katharina Richter is a biomedical researcher and science communicator at the University of Adelaide. Her research focuses on developing effective treatments against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and translating them from the lab to real-life applications, and improving the health literacy of society through effective science communication.
Dr Richter’s research has been funded by the University of Adelaide, the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Medical Research Future Fund, The Hospital Research Foundation Group, and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

Why we fact-checked this: The Facebook video bearing the claim has gained 5.7 million views, 31,000 reactions, and 4,300 comments.
The video allegedly shows GMA Regional TV’s Balitanghali host Cris Zuñiga reporting that Zamora developed a bee venom cream to cure arthritis.
The video also shows some individuals supposedly vouching for the effectiveness of the said product.
According to the post, the product is being sold at half price with a buy-one-get-one offer. Several commenters on the post also claimed that the product helped ease their joint pains.
The facts: The news report claiming Zamora developed and endorsed the bee venom cream is AI-manipulated.
An analysis using the deepfake detection tool Sensity classified the video as “suspicious” with a 99% confidence level. The altered video shows unnatural mouth movements of Zamora, Zuñiga, and others, indicating a lip-sync manipulation.
“High confidence indicates that the detector has found definite signals of AI generation or manipulation. Minimum confidence for this detector is 50%,” Sensity noted.
Zamora clarifi​​ed on Monday, September 23, that she neither endorses nor sells any bee venom creams, medicines, or supplements.
She emphasized that endorsing medical products is unethical according to the Philippine Medical Association’s Code of Ethics.
Unrelated video: The manipulated footage of Zamora was taken from her TikTok post on June 27, 2023. In the original clip, Zamora was addressing a follower’s question about the financial rewards of being a doctor. There was no mention of bone or joint therapy in the original video.
The deepfake video promoting the cream also used a video clip from the ABS-CBN medical show Salamat Dok featuring former school principal Loreta Lee. However, in the original video from September 29, 2019, Lee never mentioned using bee venom cream as a treatment for osteoarthritis.
Similar claims: Rappler has previously debunked a similar claim that used manipulated clips of Zamora and football player Cristiano Ronaldo. Another ad also used a clip of Zamora and two videos from GMA’s Pinoy MD health program to endorse a fake gout cure.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/responding-work-emails-after-hours-contributes-burnout-hostility/,"Responding to work emails after hours contributes to burnout, hostility","Imagine it’s Friday evening. You’re about to watch a new Netflix drama, trying to unwind after a long week. Suddenly, your phone pings with a work email marked “urgent.” Your heart sinks; your stress levels rise. Even if you choose not to respond immediately, the damage is done. Work has again encroached on your personal life.
The intrusion of work into home life, helped along by smartphones and other technologies, might seem like a triumph of efficiency. But this constant connectivity comes at a cost to employees and employers alike, research suggests.
As a professor of communications, I wanted to understand what happens when people feel compelled to dash off work emails after dinner and before breakfast. So a colleague and I conducted a study investigating the effects of after-hours work communication.
We found a disturbing link between work-related communication outside of regular hours and increased employee burnout. Answering emails after hours was linked to worse productivity, employees badmouthing their employers and other negative behaviors.
The research, conducted through a survey of 315 full-time US employees across various industries, draws upon the “conservation of resources theory” to explain how after-hours communication depletes employees’ mental and emotional reserves.
The data is unequivocal: Engaging in work-related communication after regular business hours leads to emotional exhaustion, which in turn can spill over into counterproductive work behavior.
This scenario is increasingly common: More than half of American employees reported checking work-related messages at least once over the weekend, according to a 2013 survey conducted by the American Psychological Association. The numbers have doubtless only risen since then.
Our findings show the consequences of this shift in the modern workplace. When the boundaries between home and work are eroded, it doesn’t just hurt people’s job and life satisfaction — it affects organizational performance, too.
We have seen firsthand the long-term impact of blurred lines between work and personal time through communication technology. In my opinion, this study is a critical wake-up call, highlighting the need for clear boundaries that protect employees’ personal time from becoming just another extension of their workday.
The blurring of work and life boundaries remains a major issue in organizational communication, and the impact of artificial intelligence has emerged as a significant research topic since ChatGPT was launched in November 2022. That’s why my team is currently exploring how AI influences skills and well-being within organizational communication.

https://www.rappler.com/world/africa/mpox-vaccines-distribution-inequality-feature/,There is an mpox jab. Why is it taking so long to reach Africa?,"Mpox is nothing new to Africa yet there is no vaccine available on the continent, exposing rank inequity in global distribution as tens of richer nations inoculate people facing far less risk.
Experts say that inequality — alongside competing health problems and slow regulation — is putting millions of Africans in jeopardy, after scientists found the virus was now mutating fast, leaping from person to person and stealing over borders.
“The lack in the distribution of mpox vaccines in Africa is due to challenges in supply, funding, and infrastructure, and because the disease is less prevalent compared to other health priorities,” Duduzile Ndwandwe, a scientist at the South African Medical Research Council (SAMARA), said in emailed comments.
Mpox had been circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo since January last year but only became a grave concern this January when scientists spotted the worrying, new mutation.
Two mpox vaccines made by Denmark’s Bavarian Nordic and Japan’s KM Biologics used to combat a 2022 outbreak have been widely available in at least 70 countries outside Africa — even administered for free in some US and European clinics.
But before Nigeria received 10,000 doses from the United States this week, no mpox vaccine was available — in any country — in Africa, and the variant now circling vulnerable, displaced populations in DRC is even more virulent than previous strains.
Mpox, formerly known as monkey pox, has been a public health problem in parts of Africa since 1970, but received little global attention until an international outbreak in 2022.
It typically causes flu-like symptoms, pus-filled lesions, and can kill. Protection costs about $100 a person.
Jimmy Whitworth, professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, described the new variant, clade 1b pox, as “fairly lethal.”
“This appears to be from sexual contact that it’s spreading, and this time it is going from person to person,” Whitworth said. “There’s now a need to raise it to the priority list because this is a serious epidemic.”
Since January 2023, there have been more than 27,000 suspected cases and 1,100 deaths in Congo, according to government figures, mainly among children.
The viral infection has spread from DRC to 12 neighboring countries, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to designate the outbreak a public health emergency.
Many African nations are struggling to meet the challenge.
Whitworth said the $100 needed to distribute a dose of the vaccine is prohibitive for governments who must quash multiple threats — measles, malaria, cholera — with limited budgets.
“It is a huge expense to vaccinate just DRC. If you asked people in DRC last year what the higher priority was, ‘was it the measles or mpox vaccine?’ They would have said ‘measles vaccine’. And so would anybody else in public health because that was a bigger threat then,” the epidemiologist said.
National regulations are also a problem.
Despite the severity of the mpox crisis and the risk of it spreading across DRC’s borders, local regulators only approved a vaccine in June with no date yet set for distribution.
In 2022, two mpox vaccines, along with public health campaigns against risky behavior, effectively controlled an outbreak that had hit 100 countries globally.
But African countries have so far remained underserved, with efforts only now ramping up to bolster their protection.
Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said it had been granted 9.34 million euros ($10.43 million) in emergency funding from the Africa Union for its mpox response and it said it would need 10 million doses of vaccines.
Bavarian Nordic said it can make 10 million doses of its vaccine by end-2025 and offered 2 million doses this year.
The WHO gave its partner agencies, including global vaccine organisation Gavi and UNICEF, the go-ahead to buy mpox vaccines pre-approval to speed their delivery to Africa.
DRC had expected to receive its first vaccines in the week of Aug. 26 after the United States and Japan both promised deliveries, but has since said it would take longer.
European Union countries have also pledged donations to help Africa fight the current outbreak.
Whitworth said regulators in Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and Kenya, all countries where cases have been detected, should approve vaccines urgently without waiting for a full outbreak.
“The vaccine isn’t even licensed in those countries,” said Whitworth. “Those countries … need to speed up the process.”
Even pre-mpox, Congo’s health system was at breaking point — weighed down by epidemics of measles and Ebola and years of conflict — and campaigners say short-term fixes won’t work.
Katharina Schroeder from Save the Children said long-term investment in social welfare and healthcare infrastructure were vital to prevent future outbreaks, with many remote health centers lacking basic testing kits or trained staff.
“The health centers outside the city need to be equipped to triage patients… because often they’re looking for things like gloves and masks,” Schroeder said.
Save the Children has been training staff on the disease, but even when diagnoses are successfully sped through, few sick patients can then afford to isolate for the mandated four weeks.
“They understand this is mpox, they understand this is dangerous for their family. But they still don’t go into isolation because they live day by day. They don’t have enough to eat,” Schroeder said.",Reuters,"Aug 30, 2024 4:10 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/world-health-organization-declared-mpox-pheic-not-global-pandemic/,FACT CHECK: WHO did not declare mpox a global pandemic,"Claim: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the recent outbreak of Monkeypox virus or mpox is a global pandemic.
Why we fact-checked this: The video, which was posted on YouTube by user Marcus Rogers, has already accumulated 55,056 views, 3,700 likes, and 781 comments as of writing. YouTube user Marcus Rogers also has over 813,000 followers on the platform.
The video claimed that the outbreak of the mpox virus has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Rogers also drew parallelisms between the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent outbreak of mpox.
The facts: On August 14, 2024, the WHO declared the mpox outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in relation to its recent spread in the Democratic Republic of Congo and nearby African countries.
The PHEIC is the highest level of alert imposed by the WHO but it is considerably different from a pandemic.
PHEIC vs. pandemic: WHO COVID-19 technical lead Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove explains that a PHEIC recognizes the potential threat that a virus poses to countries around the world.
This is a specific designation by the WHO indicating a serious public health risk that could require a coordinated international response. The difference between the two is as follows:
The recent outbreak of the mpox virus is now prevalent in certain African countries and is rising slowly as more people get infected. For an outbreak to be classified as a pandemic, it must impact a large number of people across multiple countries or continents. It spreads rapidly and widely across the globe simultaneously.
The WHO has not declared the mpox outbreak as a pandemic, but countries are advised to create interventions to prevent it from spreading further, thus, the declaration of PHEIC.
Not the first mpox outbreak. Mpox is a contagious disease that can result in a skin rash or sores. It may also be accompanied by symptoms such as fever or muscle pain. It was previously declared a PHEIC in 2022.
Experts emphasize that mpox is different from the COVID-19 pandemic as it often requires prolonged contact (such as through sexual intercourse) to be transmitted.
Why WHO declared the mpox outbreak a PHEIC: The declaration follows the emergence of a new, more virulent mpox strain known as “Clade 1b”. This strain has been spreading rapidly in Africa and beyond, raising concerns about its potential for further global transmission. (READ: EXPLAINER: Why is mpox an emergency again, and how worried should I be?)
Despite the recent outbreak of the new variant of the virus showing signs of being more transmissible among humans than its former strain counterparts, its possibility of being airborne is still undergoing extensive research. – Jerry Yubal Jr./Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/mpox-not-new-covid-says-world-health-organization/,"Mpox is not the new COVID, says WHO official","BERLIN, Germany – A World Health Organization official stressed on Tuesday, August 20, that mpox, regardless of whether it is the new or old strain, is not the new COVID, as authorities know how to control its spread.
“We can and must tackle mpox together,” said Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, in a media briefing.
“So will we choose to put the systems in place to control and eliminate mpox globally? Or we will enter another cycle of panic and neglect? How we respond now and in the years to come will prove a critical test for Europe and the world,” he added.
Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and flu-like symptoms, is usually mild but can kill.
The clade 1b variety of mpox has triggered global concern because it seems to spread more easily though routine close contact. A case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa.
Kluge said that the focus on the new clade 1 strain gives Europe a chance to refocus on the less severe clade 2 variety, including better public health advice and surveillance.
About 100 new cases of the clade 2 mpox strain are now being reported in the European region every month, added Kluge.",Reuters,"Aug 20, 2024 6:06 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/former-adviser-task-force-covid-19-not-develop-hypertension-cure/,FACT CHECK: Former adviser of task force vs COVID-19 did not develop hypertension cure,"Claim: Leading cardiologists in the Philippines, including Dr. Tony Leachon, have developed a new cure for hypertension.
Why we fact-checked this: The video, posted on August 6, has garnered 675,000 views, 6,500 reactions, and 282 comments as of this writing.
In the video, ABS-CBN News Channel (ANC) host Karen Davila purportedly introduces Dr. Leachon as one of the developers of a new hypertension medication. Davila supposedly claims that this medicine can “lower hypertension within 24 hours.”
The script in the video closely resembles the AI-manipulated video of Dr. Willie Ong, which Rappler fact-checked on May 13, 2024.
The facts: Dr. Leachon has denied the claim that he developed or endorsed any hypertension medication. He was a former adviser of the National Task Force against COVID-19.
“I’m trying to inform my followers and other patients about this anomaly but it seems that we need to do something drastic with the media’s help,” Leachon said in a Viber message to Rappler on Monday, August 19.
The video in question was manipulated, using footage from ANC’s Headstart. In the original video, uploaded on May 6, 2024, Davila and Leachon discussed reports of alleged collusion between some physicians and pharmaceutical companies regarding prescription practices.
Leachon suggested that a certain pharmaceutical company offers luxury cars and other incentives to doctors in exchange for prescribing their products.
At no point in the video did Leachon and Davila discuss any new hypertension medication.
Deepfake: Deepfake detection tool Sensity also found the video to be “suspicious” with a 99% confidence level.
“High confidence indicates that the detector has found definite signals of AI generation or manipulation. Minimum confidence for this detector is 50%,” Sensity noted.
A closer examination of the video reveals unnatural mouth movements and glitches, consistent with Sensity’s findings that the video was manipulated through “lipsync.”
The tool also flagged the faces of Davila and Leachon as “fake faces,” each with a 99% confidence level.
In recent months, Rappler has noticed a surge in the number of AI-manipulated videos to promote health products. – James Patrick Cruz/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/mpox-outbreak-could-turn-into-next-global-pandemic/,Mpox outbreak in Africa was neglected – it could now turn into the next global pandemic,"The mpox outbreak in Africa is yet another example of how infectious diseases perceived to be “someone else’s problem,” and affecting mainly poor, developing countries, may suddenly pose unexpected global threats.
Other examples of neglected diseases include the West Nile, Zika and Chikungunya viruses.
Mpox was discovered in 1958 (in captive monkeys, hence the original misnomer “monkeypox”) and the first human case was identified in 1970. Then for decades it was largely neglected by the scientific and public health communities, regarded as an uncommon infection in remote rural areas in tropical Africa without relevance for the rest of the world.
When a massive mpox outbreak hit developed countries in 2022, increased research funding led to a surge in scientific studies. On just one medical search engine, there’s been more research produced since April 2022 than in the preceding 60 years.
The 2022-23 global mpox outbreak happened despite repeated calls from African researchers for increased global investment in diagnostic, therapeutic and infection prevention tools for mpox.
The WHO has now declared the current upsurge of mpox in central Africa a public health emergency of international concern.
This is the highest alert level for events that constitute a public health risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.
We are infectious disease researchers who have worked on HIV, SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.
Mpox’s recent history is yet another reminder that an infectious disease in one corner of the world should not be regarded as someone else’s problem, as it can suddenly start to spread fast and far.
It also highlights global inequities in resource allocation and access to vaccines, diagnostics and treatments. These were made available in many industrialized countries and helped curb the global outbreak, but are still largely lacking in most of Africa.
The disease has been renamed “mpox” but the name of the virus, for now, remains “monkeypox” (MPXV). It is closely related to the smallpox virus.
MPXV was considered a zoonotic disease endemic in parts of central and west Africa. It was acquired mainly through close contact with wild mammals, especially handling bush meat, but there was no sustained human-to-human transmission.
Only very occasionally were cases seen outside the endemic areas, due to infected travellers or import of infected small mammals.
This changed abruptly in 2022: a massive, rapidly evolving global outbreak caused over 99,000 laboratory-confirmed cases in 116 countries. At its peak in August 2022, over 6,000 cases were reported each week.
This outbreak came as a total surprise: most cases were reported from non-endemic countries, mostly in men who have sex with men who had become infected during recent sexual encounters.
Even though most cases were clinically not particularly severe and the death toll stands at just over 200, the global  outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on 23 July 2022.
Fortunately, case numbers soon plummeted  due to a combination of behavioural changes and vaccination in at-risk groups.
Modern vaccines and antiviral drugs with activity against mpox were made available in many affected high-income countries.
These had been developed and stockpiled in the US and Europe, mostly in preparation for a potential bioweapon attack using a poxvirus.
The global outbreak in 2022 was caused by clade II of MPXV, which is endemic in west Africa and not as virulent as clade I MPXV, which so far has only been seen in the Congo Basin.
That first mpox public health emergency of international concern was declared over in May 2023.
Clade II MPXV infections are still occurring globally, but the worst seems over — for now.
Complacency would be misguided, as illustrated by the current mpox outbreak that is gathering steam.
The African region is experiencing an upsurge in mpox cases which started in 2023.
As the continent which includes the areas where mpox has been endemic for a long time, Africa now presents a complex mosaic:
cases arising from the endemic, largely zoonotic, pattern that used to be predominant in the past
cases linked to the 2022 global outbreak, for example in South Africa
most worryingly, ever increasing numbers of MPXV clade Ib infections reported from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The current clade I MPXV (formerly called Congo Basin strain) is more virulent than the clade II (west African) strain, resulting in a higher case fatality rate.
The ongoing outbreak has its epicentre in South Kivu province, eastern DRC, and has the potential to fuel a large pandemic.
It has a distinct epidemiological pattern with sustained chains of human-to-human transmission, often via the sexual route.
It may have increased transmissibility (we don’t know yet).
The virus which causes it is the newly defined clade Ib lineage. It displays  mutations that are the hallmark of human-to-human spread that is estimated to have been happening since September 2023.
Case numbers are rising rapidly, even though many suspected cases are likely not tested and thus not counted as confirmed. Complicating matters, a commonly used test was found to miss infections with this lineage of the virus.
It affects mostly adults.
The case fatality rate is higher than it was in the 2022 global outbreak.
Already, this outbreak has resulted in mpox cases occurring in several neighbouring countries, including some (like Kenya) with no previous record of mpox.
The challenge is enormous. The eastern DRC is an area beset by multiple problems. This includes natural disasters, violence and infectious diseases including measles, cholera and poliomyelitis for the DRC.
In recent years the second-largest Ebola outbreak ever took place in the wider area and, despite the availability of vaccines and treatments, posed considerable challenges.
A recent article we co-authored in The Lancet Global Health outlines what needs to be done to contain this outbreak and prevent it from turning into an epidemic, possibly even a pandemic.
Equitable access to diagnostic tests, vaccines and antiviral treatments requires political commitment and financial investments.
Scientific investigations are needed to learn more about exposure settings, transmission routes, and clinical presentations.
It’s important to find the best ways to make these interventions.
We have proposed the establishment of an African-led, multidisciplinary, multi-country Mpox Research Consortium (MpoxReC) in Africa.
It should conduct research towards the elimination of mpox as a public health problem.
There is no doubt that a disease in one corner of the world can suddenly become a global heath threat. It’s time the global health system woke up to this reality. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/explainer-why-mpox-emergency-again/,"EXPLAINER: Why is mpox an emergency again, and how worried should I be?","LONDON, United Kingdom – The World Health Organization has declared that an outbreak of mpox, a viral infection that spreads through close contact, represents a global health emergency for the second time in two years.
Here’s what that means.
A “public health emergency of international concern” or PHEIC is WHO’s highest form of alert. It is announced when diseases are spreading in new or unusual ways, and is aimed at galvanizing international co-operation and funding to tackle an outbreak. WHO’s declaration follows a similar label from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this week.
Two years ago, WHO declared mpox was an emergency when a form of the disease began to spread globally, largely among men who have sex with men. That outbreak was brought under control after behavior change and safe sex practices, plus vaccines, helped people at risk protect themselves in many countries.
But mpox has been a public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The first ever human case was in Congo in 1970, and it has had outbreaks ever since.
The current outbreak, Congo’s worst ever, has seen 27,000 cases and more than 1,100 deaths since January 2023, largely among children. The disease causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions, and is usually mild but can kill. Children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, are all at higher risk of complications.
Two strains of mpox are now spreading in the country: the endemic form of the virus as well as a new offshoot.
This new form of the virus has triggered global concern because it seems to be spreading quickly and little is known about it. It is transmitting through sexual contact as well as other close contact — such as among children in displacement camps in parts of Congo — and has now moved from eastern Congo to Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and Kenya.
Scientists hope that the emergency declarations will speed up efforts to get more medical tools and funding to Congo to help the authorities there tackle the outbreak. Better surveillance is needed to study the virus and help stop the spread.
But in 2022, a WHO appeal for $34 million to fight mpox got no take-up from donors, and there was huge inequity in who had access to vaccine doses. African countries had no access to the two shots used in the global outbreak, made by Bavarian Nordic and KM Biologics. Two years later, that remains the case, although there are efforts to change that, WHO said on Wednesday as it appealed for dose donations from countries with stockpiles. Africa CDC also said it has a plan to secure doses, without elaborating further, but stocks are currently limited.
Mpox is a significant health problem that is killing some of the most vulnerable people in the world, including children, and a form of it is possibly spreading in new ways and in new parts of Africa.
But it is not COVID-19. So far, there is no evidence that it spreads through the air easily like COVID, and there are tools that are proven to work to stop the spread and help those at risk.
The challenge now, which the emergency declarations aim to highlight, is making sure those tools reach those who need them most, in Congo and neighboring countries.",Reuters,"Aug 16, 2024 6:45 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/world-health-organization-declares-mpox-emergency-august-14-2024/,WHO declares mpox a global public health emergency for second time in 2 years,"The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, August 14, declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighboring countries.
An emergency committee met earlier on Wednesday to advise WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on whether the disease outbreak constitutes a “public health emergency of international concern,” or PHEIC.
PHEIC status is WHO’s highest level of alert and aims to accelerate research, funding, and international public health measures and cooperation to contain a disease.
“It’s clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives,” said Tedros.
Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.
The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact.
It has spread from Congo to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, triggering the action from the WHO.
“The detection and rapid spread of a new clade of mpox in eastern DRC, its detection in neighbouring countries that had not previously reported mpox, and the potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very worrying,” Tedros added.
Tedros said on Wednesday that WHO had released $1.5 million in contingency funds and plans to release more in the coming days. WHO’s response plan would require an initial $15 million, and the agency plans to appeal to donors for funding.
Earlier this week, Africa’s top public health body declared an mpox emergency for the continent after warning that the viral infection was spreading at an alarming rate, with more than 17,000 suspected cases and more than 500 deaths this year, mainly among children in Congo.
Professor Dimie Ogoina, chair of WHO’s mpox emergency committee, said all members unanimously agreed that the current upsurge of cases is an “extraordinary event,” with a record number of cases in Congo.
Vaccines and behavior change helped stop the spread when a different strain of mpox spread globally, primarily among men who have sex with men, and WHO declared an emergency in 2022.
In Congo, the transmission routes need further study, WHO said. No vaccines are yet available, although efforts are underway to change that and work out who best to target. The agency also appealed to countries with stockpiles to donate shots.",Reuters,"Aug 15, 2024 12:34 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/drugmaker-sinergium-share-bird-flu-vaccine-data-globally/,"Drugmaker Sinergium to share bird flu vaccine data globally, says WHO","GENEVA, Switzerland – Bird flu vaccine developer Sinergium Biotech will share its data with manufacturers in low and middle-income countries to help to accelerate a fair rollout if a pandemic occurs, the World Health Organization said on Monday, July 29.
The Argentine private sector biopharmaceutical company is at an early stage of developing mRNA vaccines against the H5N1 virus and has pledged to share its findings with a network of partner manufacturers set up by the WHO during the peak of COVID-19 to help poorer countries to gain access to life-saving medical tools.
Until now, the WHO has assisted partners but this is the first time one of them with a vaccine in development has volunteered to share it with others.
“Partners interested in this will be able to start getting their fingers wet, beginning to practice with an H5N1 candidate so that if a pandemic was to start… they would already have the necessary tools in their facilities,” said Dr. Martin Friede, head of the WHO vaccine research unit.
The WHO’s mRNA technology transfer hub program includes manufacturers in 15 countries, though not all are fully established. Among those involved in the program are Biovac in South Africa and Institut Pasteur in Senegal.
The South African center was set up after global pharmaceuticals companies including Moderna and Pfizer declined to provide the technical know-how to replicate their COVID-19 vaccines, mainly owing to intellectual property concerns.
The outbreak of H5N1 in dairy cows and some farm workers in the United States prompted Washington to award $176 million to Moderna to advance development of its bird flu vaccine.
While the WHO has said the risk to the public from the avian influenza virus remains low and that it is not spreading between people, they say it has the potential to cause a future pandemic because of its widespread circulation in animals.
While Friede acknowledges that the likes of Moderna and Pfizer would be able to produce vaccines much more quickly than manufacturers in the WHO program, he said that the scheme would allow Sinergium’s partners to begin production reasonably quickly and help to keep poorer countries from being reliant on handouts.
There are vaccines available for the H5N1 strain that is spreading among cows in the United States, but they are mostly made using chicken eggs, which means they would take months to produce at scale if needed.
Sinergium’s mRNA flu vaccine has yet to be tested in people, the WHO said, so it would require human trials before use.
Moderna’s mRNA H5N1 flu vaccine is further advanced, with late-stage trials in humans expected to take place next year.",Reuters,"Jul 29, 2024 3:43 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/why-society-needs-to-address-loneliness/,Why society needs to address loneliness,"Several scientific studies have found that loneliness can lead to poor physical and mental health.
The absence of high-quality social connections has been linked to depression, dementia, cardiovascular diseases and even early death. Chronic loneliness can have the same effect on your physical and mental health as obesity, physical inactivity and smoking.
According to the US Surgeon General, the mortality effect of loneliness is equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. The World Health Organization has described loneliness as “a pressing health threat”.
Loneliness rose alarmingly during the COVID-19 pandemic because of physical isolation, lockdowns and remote work and education.
Although people may seem more connected via social media, research shows that while these platforms may help people connect with each other, those using social media to maintain relationships feel lonelier than those who use it for other reasons.
Social isolation is not limited to certain age groups. The WHO estimates that between 5 and 15% of adolescents experience loneliness.
Research has shown that overall loneliness is more prevalent in the young than the middle-aged and more in the middle-aged than older people; more in men than women and more in those living in individualistic societies rather than collectivist ones.
There is also a high prevalence of loneliness and social isolation among transgender and gender diverse people and those with disabilities.
Loneliness can have an acute impact on the wellbeing of older adults as they live longer and have to contend with declining health, poor family support and limited social engagement.
A society or community’s safety, prosperity and effective governance depend greatly on the quality of the social connections within its neighborhoods, communities, workplaces and schools.
Although loneliness and social isolation have serious impacts on physical and mental health, there is no pharmacological intervention for treating them. There is also no one-size-fits-all social intervention.
However, solutions do exist in different cultures and societies to counter loneliness.
Dealing with the loneliness epidemic, therefore, needs national policies, community initiatives and personal practices. These could include volunteering, consciously connecting with friends and family routinely, having a regular exercise regime and psychological interventions designed to tackle individual needs as required. – 360info/Rappler.com

Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual signed on Saturday Department Administrative Order (DAO) No. 24-03, series of 2024, which “suspends the online sale of vapor products, vapor product devices, and vapor product systems on marketplaces, effective immediately,” DTI said in a press statement.
“The protection of our youth is non-negotiable. The proliferation of vapor products on online marketplaces has made these harmful substances easily accessible to minors, posing a significant threat to their health and well-being. This suspension is a necessary step to curb this alarming trend,” Pascual said.
DTI said that Pascual issued the order following dialogues with  high-level stakeholders in the industry including manufacturers, importers, and distributors.
“We want businesses to thrive, but it must be in line with the law. Let’s not profit from selling to minors. As long as you comply, we will support you. However, you must prove that you are preventing minors from buying these illegal products,” Pascual was quoted in the DTI statement as saying.
Health experts have been calling for stricter rules against electronic cigarettes and vape pens, citing the aggressive sale and marketing promotion of these products to the youth.
In December 2023, the World Health Organization called for “urgent measures” to control vapes.  (READ: Ban flavored vapes, WHO says, urging tobacco-style controls)
DTI said Pascual also cited the need for “(1) robust tracking systems to oversee product movement from importers to retailers, (2) holding manufacturers and importers responsible for illegal or defective products, not just retailers, and (3) ensuring that distributors educate retailers on the law’s limitations and restrictions to ensure compliance.”
“Moreover, the DTI chief acknowledged concerns raised by manufacturers regarding unused inventory, noting that some had stopped ordering 90-day stock since the transitory period began. While the DTI prefers to avoid imposing new regulations, Secretary Pascual made it clear that severe consequences will result from non-compliance,” DTI said.
DTI said DAO 24-03 is in line with Republic Act No. 11900 or the Vaporized Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Products Regulation Act.
“This law mandates measures to prevent minors from accessing vapor products, particularly through online channels. The suspension also aligns with the government’s commitment to promoting a healthy environment and protecting citizens from potential hazards associated with these products,” the department said.
Since it was formed in April, DTI’s Task Force Kalasag has issued 78 notices of violation and confiscation of 64,359 violative vape products, valued at P29,487,100.",Rappler.com,"Jul 20, 2024 2:48 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/blue-zones-bumble-and-boomer-dating-relationships/,[Blue Zones] Bumble vs Boomer,"If you’re looking for an answer, you’ve come to the wrong place.
My Crying Millennial is bemoaning her recent failed Bumble date. When she asked her date, so do we meet up again? He shrugged.
“What does that mean?! Is that it? I get a shrug?”
“Maybe it’s not meant to be. He’s out there for you. Claim it. What other clichés can I offer you?,” I said. “How about another margarita?”
Bumble is a dating app designed to address feminist sensibilities. Women make the initial contact. This was meant to empower women in the dating app scene.
Women choose. Men wait to be chosen. Very empowering indeed. Except when you get a shrug.
My Boomer friends were shocked. That exists here in the Philippines? Geez, where have you been?!?
This is how it works. The app suggests potential matches based on your profile. You get to view them on your phone. You swipe left to reject and swipe right if you want to have a conversation. Dead silence and shock follows from the Boomers.
Comes my Hopeful Gen-Xer. She would opt for a phone call before meeting. Some people might appear charming in texts, but are a completely different story over the phone. My nephew even said if the prospect committed any grammatical errors, this would be a no-go.
If he/she/they/them pass the phone test, you can meet for coffee (no promises for a long meeting over dinner; well, that’s dating 101 right?). Then with some chemistry and luck, you might have a match, not just for the short term, but perhaps the rest of your life?
My Hopeful Gen-Xer has very stringent filters in her profile. Minimum height requirement, education, of course age (no younger men please).
“The problem with those filters,” said My Evolved Gen-Zer “is you limit yourself.” She explained: “There might be some ‘compact’ guys out there that may overcome the height challenge with their wit and charm. Tom Cruise – case in point.”
“Would you recommend Bumble?”
My Evolved Gen-Zer’s quick answer is NO.
Because as has been discovered in the years since its establishment in 2014, women have found that more often than not, their Bumble dates end up with the My Crying Millennial scenario.
My personal observation? Men are not necessarily looking for the same thing as women are hoping to find.
“Mind you, Bumble is a business,” said My Evolved GenZ-er. “You have to pay extra to enjoy added features like reviewing your previous likes, in case the current batch doesn’t  work out. Much like paying for a no-ads subscription to YouTube. At the end of the day, your profile is there on Bumble and in effect, you become a product of Bumble.”
One needed a minute to process that.
“I want what you had. A true and enduring love. Someone that I would be happy to cook for. Hell, I’ll even fold his clothes for him!,” added the Hopeful Gen-Xer.
So much for women’s lib.
Conservatives 1. Libbers 0.
What makes us want to fold clothes for our partners? I’m no expert, but I suspect, it’s nesting. The human offspring cannot survive in the wild on its own. It needs both parents to survive. One to hunt for food and the other to nurse, nurture, and keep the cave warm and protected from predators.
“It’s also a matter of luck,” said My Evolved GenZ-er. “You just have to put yourself out there and hopefully (Hopeful Gen-Xer) you will find that love of your life.”
Will the filters bring My Hopeful Gen-Xer and Crying Millennial closer to the love of their lives? I wonder what kind of likes you would get if you wrote, “Looking for the love of my life” in your Bumble profile?
In the Blue Zones, couples who grew old together enjoy longevity. They are blessed.
In Greek mythology, humans rolled around the earth with 4 arms, 4 legs and 2 faces. Zeus feared they would become too powerful and split them in half. We have since been doomed to search for our “other half.” Remember Jerry Maguire’s “You complete me”?
Some of us have had days filled with laughter, warm embraces, quiet nights and brilliant sunrises holding on to that one love of our lives. We treasure those days. Aren’t we the lucky ones?
Until we are reunited, we find solace in writing poetry.

https://www.rappler.com/philippines/luzon/cyclists-challenging-terrains-bike-festival-begins-baguio/,Cyclists take on challenging terrains as bike festival begins in Baguio,"BAGUIO, Philippines – Throughout the year, the temperature in Baguio City and surrounding areas is, on average, 10 degrees lower than in Metro Manila. These conditions are optimal for biking, though the terrain can be challenging for many.
That’s what close to 60 cyclists undertook from June 15 to 17, when they participated in the Sang-at Sakbat Bikepacking Adventure weekend, which was part of the ongoing bike festival in Baguio.
They started before dawn on June 15, on a mostly uphill ride of about 30 kilometers from the Benguet Province Welcome Arch, snaking up Kennon Road, following the path of the Bued River up to the iconic Lion’s Head for lunch. Then, they continued to the Pine Trees of the World Park where they set up camp.
The following day, they played tourists, riding their bicycles early to visit some tourist spots in the BLISTT area (Baguio City and the towns of La Trinidad, Itogon, Sablan, Tuba, and Tublay).
The day ended with like-minded cyclists from different parts of Luzon listening to live music, sharing good food, and having animated conversations during the “Sab-atan Cultural Night” at the campsite.
Cycling organizations like the Senior Bikers of the Philippines and Cycad Pilipinas were well-represented.
The adventure was part of the second year of the ongoing Sang-atan BLISTT Bike Festival, which carries the theme: A BLISTTful Community: Fostering Road Sharing Towards Safety and Wellness. “Sang-atan” is an Iloko word for “uphill.”
According to Joebel Gurang, the event’s co-organizer, about 20% of the participants were new to the bike festival, which would last until July. This year is different because, unlike in 2023, Kennon Road has been opened to all kinds of vehicles, so cyclists experience how to navigate their bicycles alongside cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles.
The event officially started with a ceremony at the Baguio City Hall and a ride on June 3, coinciding with World Bike Day.
There are upcoming major events, and these are as follows:
Other activities include the Bike Mechanic Olympics on June 23, the Sang-at Silaw Tour of the Lights on July 6, and on July 14, a Kiddie Race and the Shimano Gravel Adventure.
The festival will culminate in a charity ride around Baguio on July 21, a Sunday.
Gurang said that aside from increasing awareness about the benefits of riding bicycles and nurturing the cycling community in Baguio, the festival aims to promote road safety and wellness and to gain recognition that cyclists also share the road.
“These efforts align perfectly with ‘Breathe Baguio,’ our city’s initiative aimed at creating greener, more breathable urban spaces,” said Baguio Mayor Benjamin Magalong, himself an avid cyclist.
In 2021, the Mobility Awards recognized Baguio City with a bronze award, acknowledging it as one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in Luzon. The Mobility Awards is organized by the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities, MNL Moves, Climate Reality Project-Philippines, 350.org Pilipinas, and the Pinay Bike Commuter Community and advocates for better road conditions for cyclists in the Philippines.
In 2023, Gurang said, the bike count results showed more than 6,300 people on bicycles in a single day in Baguio alone.",Mari-An C. Santos,"Jun 18, 2024 2:33 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/us-adults-dementia-diagnosis-reporting-survey/,"About 4% of US adults aged 65 and older have a dementia diagnosis, survey finds","Some 4% of US adults aged 65 and older say they have been diagnosed with dementia, a rate that reached 13% for those at least 85-years old, according to a report of a national survey released on Thursday, June 13.
The report issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was based on the 2022 National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 18 and older. The survey in 2019 added the option to report dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, to its questions on doctor-diagnosed health conditions.
The CDC said 1.7% of adults ages 65 to 74 reported a dementia diagnosis, a rate that increased with age. For those ages 75 to 84, the reported dementia rate was 5.7%.
The agency conducted in-person or telephone interviews with 8,757 people age 65 and older who were asked whether they have been diagnosed with some form of dementia.
Ellen Kramarow, the report’s lead author, said dementia diagnosis estimates were in general similar from 2019 to 2022, adding that they “do not see this as a measure that is going to have large changes year to year.”
Alzheimer’s is the leading cause of dementia, which involves the loss of memory, language, problem-solving and other cognitive abilities severe enough to interfere with daily life, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.
The report accompanies the arrival of new treatments designed to slow progression of the mind-wasting disease, such as Biogen and Eisai’s Leqembi, which won US approval last July. Eli Lilly’s similar treatment, donanemab, was unanimously endorsed by an advisory panel to the US Food and Drug Administration on Monday and is widely expected to be approved.
The CDC report showed dementia diagnoses were lowest among people with college degrees and highest among people with less than a high school education.
Several studies have suggested that people with higher levels of education have larger cognitive reserves that can temporarily delay dementia symptoms.
The overall estimates are similar to other national surveys, such as the 2021 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, which estimated that nearly 3% of Medicare beneficiaries not residing in nursing homes or long-term care facilities had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s or another type of dementia.",Reuters,"Jun 13, 2024 12:59 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/blue-zones-who-would-have-thought-blue-zones-in-makati/,[Blue Zones] Who would have thought? Blue zones in Makati?,"Finally, I found a bridge club: the Philippine Tournament Bridge Association at the Elks Club in Makati. I was really rusty but was thankfully paired with one of the young national team members (yes, we have a national team).
After getting over my epic fail as a bridge player, I had a chance to look around the room and noticed that a good number of the players were in their ’80s. They were all sharp as tacks and remembered every single card that had been played. No dementia problems here. They were all in good health, not avoiding any particular items on the menu. The ladies were well put together, dressed casually, trendy. No canes. There was an occasional wheelchair – but more for convenience than necessity.
During a break, as I was chatting with one of the ladies, she said, “Ah, you live in Makati Cinema Square! I’m there every Saturday at Dancing Queen!” To my surprise, near shock, she said, “Argentinian tango lang.”
“Lang?!”
I asked my bridge partner, how old is she?
“Titang? Ask her.”
“Baka ma-offend.”
“No one gets offended about age here.”
I asked. Titang is 90, declaring her age with a broad smile and a slight silver-haired hair toss. If there was an emoji for this moment, I certainly could have used one. Say what you will. She prefers tango because her partner has a good hold on her, but at the end of the day, that’s a good three hours on the dance floor in dancing shoes!
And this brings me to the matter of the Netflix documentary, Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones by National Geographic author, explorer and 3-time Guinness record holder for distance cycling, Dan Buettner.
Buettner spent the last 20 years trying to solve the mystery of longevity, why certain parts of the world had the highest number of centenarians. What kept them in good health in their old age? His research brought him to Okinawa, Sardinia, Loma Linda in California, Nicoya in Costa Rica, and, finally, Singapore.
In Okinawa, old people went about their daily chores or hobbies, regularly met with friends and relatives playing games and singing. In Sardinia, it was very much the same. People walked everywhere, made bread, cooked food together to share with their families. In Nicoya, women prepared tortillas the traditional way, grinding corn against stone and kneading the dough as they have done for generations.
As it turns out, daily activities of walking, preparing food, cleaning up, gardening, and moving naturally proved to be better than hours at a gym. A common diet of fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts and grain was evident in all the Blue Zone regions.  The Mediterranean diet has long been known to be healthy.
So the bridge story gets better.
I sat across two formidable players, Inday at 95 and Alice, 89. Again, no memory problems here. Inday said she keeps herself busy with the family business.  No particular diet. But her key is just a glass of milk and a banana for dinner. She said you have to give your system a chance to digest.
Did she do this instinctively? No food after 6 diet? Intermittent fasting? In Okinawa, they stressed that what mattered  was not only what you ate, but how much you ate.
One of the bridge players, Ms. Abla, stands tall and smart, her posture held up well because of her years of yoga. Her secret? “If you have a craving, give in to it. But just a little.” In other words, don’t eat the whole chocolate bar.
Okay, a handful of bridge players do not a Blue Zone in Makati make. But after reviewing Buettner’s basic principles which he developed from the Blue Zones he visited, it became more and more apparent that these bridge players, I call them 89’ers, knew what they were doing towards enjoying a healthy life through their ’90s – and perhaps more.
In Buettner’s work, Loma Linda, California, was featured for its a strong 7th day Adventist community. Their motto, “Evangelism through health.” In Sardinia, they were devout Catholics; in Okinawa, what was common was ancestral veneration.
Buettner cited a study that showed that participating in spiritual services more than once a week, extended one’s life by 7 years. It doesn’t matter what religion. This is available to all of us.
In all cases, respect and care for elders, and their inclusion in social activities, proved beneficial for elders as well as the young who enjoyed the wit and wisdom of previous generations.
In Singapore, the government gave special housing subsidies to families who lived with their elders.
Our bridge club Blue Zone 89ers know their stuff. Every day, they count themselves fortunate to be enjoying good health and engaging in their various activities – whether it’s bridge, walking groups, dance, charities, prayer groups, or Joy Luck Clubs.
They are all playing with a winning hand. They don’t pass. They go for game.",Bing Caballero,"Jun 2, 2024 5:31 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/tobacco-industry-aims-hook-new-generation-vapes-world-health-organization/,"Tobacco industry aims to hook new generation on vapes, WHO says","LONDON, United Kingdom – Tobacco companies still actively target young people via social media, sports and music festivals and new, flavored products, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday, accusing companies of trying to hook a new generation on nicotine.
Amid ever-stricter regulation targeting cigarettes, big tobacco companies and new entrants have begun offering smoking alternatives such as vapes, which they say are aimed at adult smokers.
But the WHO said these products are often marketed to youth, their design and variety of fruity flavours appeals to children, and that young people are more likely to use the products than adults in many countries.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s Director-General, rejected the industry’s claim that it is working to reduce the harm from smoking. “It’s dishonest to talk about harm reduction when they are marketing to children,” he said.
The WHO’s increasingly tough stance on newer nicotine products follows a sharp rise in youth vaping across several countries.
The WHO pointed to flavors like bubblegum as one driver of this rise. The industry says flavors are an important tool in encouraging adults to switch away from smoking.
Large tobacco companies have mostly steered away from such flavors. But firms including Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco target youth via the sponsorship of music and sports festivals and the use of social media, the WHO said.
These provide platforms to promote their brands to younger audiences and hand out free samples, it continued.
PMI and BAT did not immediately send a comment.
The WHO also said there is insufficient evidence vapes help people quit smoking, there is growing evidence they harm health, and that vaping increases traditional cigarette use, especially among youth.
However, Sarah Jackson, principal research fellow at University College London’s Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group, said these statements “do not accurately reflect current evidence on e-cigarettes.”
Evidence shows e-cigarette use increases quit rates and that vaping poses only a fraction of the risks of smoking tobacco, she said, adding there is also little evidence of a causal relationship between vaping and smoking.",Reuters,"May 23, 2024 10:49 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/claim-inhale-intestinal-gas-cure-disease-misrepresents-2014-study/,FACT CHECK: Claim that inhaling intestinal gas can cure disease misrepresents 2014 study,"Claim: Inhaling intestinal gas or farts can help prevent and treat diseases.
Why we fact-check this: The Facebook reel containing the claim has 9,400 reactions, 537 comments, and 5,8500 shares as of writing. It was uploaded by the page “Kaalamang Herbal,” which posts about herbal medicine and supplements.
The video implies that inhaling intestinal gas can help prevent and cure diseases. The caption of the video says, “Kaya mo bang lumanghap ng utot para panggamot? (Can you inhale intestinal gas as a treatment?)” accompanied by the hashtag #alternativemedicine.
The video, citing unnamed experts, said intestinal gas contains hydrogen sulfide that protects the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cells. The gas also helps prevent hypertension, heart disease, kidney failure, and Alzheimer’s disease, according to the video.
The facts: Scientists have debunked the claim that inhaling intestinal gas can prevent or cure diseases. According to a 2014 NBC News article, misinformation on the supposed health benefits of inhaling intestinal gas stemmed from some news websites’ overgeneralization of a press release by the University of Exeter on its 2014 study that highlighted the potential health benefits of hydrogen sulfide.
According to the study, mitochondria use small quantities of hydrogen sulfide when stressed by disease, allowing them to keep working. Scientists then developed a compound called AP39, which helps deliver hydrogen sulfide to the mitochondria.
“Our results indicate that if stressed cells are treated with AP39, mitochondria are protected and cells stay alive,” Professor Matt Whiteman, one of the researchers, said.
The study added that “preventing or reversing mitochondrial damage is a key strategy” in treating diseases such as stroke, heart failure, diabetes, arthritis, dementia, and aging.
No mention: Contrary to the Facebook reel and news headlines that said smelling intestinal gas could prevent disease, neither the researchers nor the study made the claim.
The University of Exeter press release merely noted that hydrogen sulfide is “well known as a pungent, foul-smelling gas in rotten eggs and flatulence.”
The NBC story also featured Dr. Csaba Szabo of the University of Texas, who collaborated with the University of Exeter researchers. Szabo was quoted in the article as saying that “none of this research says you should go and inhale farts.” – Ailla Dela Cruz/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/no-surgery-low-cost-alternatives-treat-chronic-pain/,"No-surgery, low-cost alternatives to treat chronic pain","Women’s back pain is increasingly being taken seriously. But common spinal surgeries can be costly and risky.
Chronic pain has a devastating impact on sufferers, with women harboring most of the burden.
The troubling paradox for women is this: while they suffer more chronic pain than men — they often find their reports of pain not taken seriously.
To add insult to injury, they are also often on the receiving end of sub-optimal assessment and treatment.
Women receive less and less effective pain relief, are prescribed more antidepressants, get more mental health referrals and are perceived as emotional, complaining, not wanting to get better, and fabricating the pain.
This makes women with chronic pain a particularly vulnerable group. Given these worrying trends in women’s care, it’s important women be made aware of safe and effective treatments available for their pain.
Women’s health advocates point out that it’s important women be able to access treatment for their pain, and that it be taken seriously.
But there are increasing concerns this agenda is being hijacked by vested interests — namely specialists and companies which craft female health narratives to promote treatments not backed by evidence.
When it comes to pain management, spinal fusions and spinal stimulation devices are two pertinent examples, as a recent ABC Four Corners episode in Australia examined.
Spinal cord stimulators are surgically implanted devices that deliver electric impulses to the spinal cord. Despite aggressive marketing regarding their effectiveness, a high-quality review of all the scientific trials on these devices has found that spinal cord stimulators probably do not “have sustained clinical benefits that would outweigh the costs and risks of this surgical intervention”.
An analysis reported to Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration provides sobering evidence of the risks associated with these devices.
Of 520 adverse events associated with spinal stimulators reported between 2012 and 2019, 79% were considered “severe” and 13% were “life-threatening”. Compounding matters, these devices are also pricey: With hospital costs factored in, the total cost for a single procedure averages more than $58,000.
Spinal fusion is a surgery that permanently fuses two or more vertebrae together to stop them moving on each other.
A review of the literature found that fusions are not more effective than non-surgical treatments (such as exercise) and serious harms — which can include nerve injury, heart failure, infections and blood clots — occur in one in six patients. As well as being risky, the procedure is also expensive. In Australia, depending on one’s health insurance status, one surgery costs more than $41,000.
For decades, pain was understood to be caused by biological factors and disease pathology only. Most treatments were based on this assumption.
In recent years, many guidelines for various chronic pain conditions have shifted to focus on non-drug and non-surgical treatments.
This is a move away from harmful over-medicalisation — and is better aligned with the latest, evidence-backed view, which understands chronic pain as a personal biopsychosocial experience, which recognises that pain emerges from a dynamic interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors.
Addressing these factors in an individualised way is now considered best practice for chronic pain.
While in the past, a woman with chronic back pain may have been referred by her GP for imaging and drugs or referred to an orthopaedic surgeon, a more appropriate pathway for many types of pain may now involve a GP and physiotherapist working with the patient in an individual way to apply biopsychosocial techniques for pain management.
Depending on needs, some patients may benefit from referral to a dietician, psychologist, or occupational therapists.
Advice and information to improve a patient’s understanding of their pain or appropriate management is the most important and effective treatment. This includes how to stay physically active, managing setbacks, healthy lifestyle, and how to self-manage and cope with pain.
Unfortunately, many people miss out on education. Sufferers should ask their health professionals for simple explanations as there is strong evidence people with chronic pain want to be heard and validated, and working with a health professional who is a good communicator is important for patient outcomes.
Exercise and physical activity are another vital part of chronic pain management. We now know that regular exercise not only helps keep the body fit and healthy, but actually reduces pain and discomfort. It also relaxes muscle tension, helps mood and strengthens the immune system once started gradually.
When you are in pain, starting exercise can feel hard. Keep in mind that under-used muscles feel more pain than healthy muscles — so if you’re feeling sore after exercise, this does not indicate harm or damage to the body.
All types of exercise are good- so pick one you enjoy, can afford and which is convenient.
Chronic pain sufferers may also want to consider Cognitive Functional Therapy (CFT) , a new treatment developed for lower back pain, which can be adapted for other musculoskeletal pain conditions — as long as serious causes of the pain (for example, cancer or broken bones) are excluded. CFT is offered by some specially trained physiotherapists and other clinicians.
In this therapy, the clinician works with the patient to identify and address their individual barriers to recovery, coaching them to self-manage their condition and reach their goals.
It takes in body relaxation, awareness and control techniques before moving to lifestyle coaching for healthy sleep habits; stress management strategies; social engagement and work.
The effectiveness of this treatment is backed by research, with 11 clinical trials having already demonstrated CFT efficacy.
The largest clinical trial, published in The Lancet, included 492 people with chronic lower back pain. It found large and sustained improvements in function and reductions in pain levels for people who underwent CFT, compared with those receiving usual care.
People who underwent CFT were also more confident, less fearful and had a more positive mindset about their back pain.
Importantly they liked it, with 80% of participants satisfied or highly satisfied with the treatment, compared to 19% in the usual care group. The treatment was as safe as usual care and was also cost-effective. It saved more than AUD$5,000 per person over a year, largely due to increased participation at work. – 360infor.org/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/navel-gazing-checking-your-belly-button-tell-lot-about-your-health/,Navel gazing: checking your belly button can tell you a lot about your health,"Navels, belly buttons, innies or outies … whatever term you use, your umbilicus may have plenty to tell you about the state of your health.
For some, they are the thing of nightmares – omphalophobia (the fear of belly buttons) is a real condition. For others, they are a fashion accessory to be shown off in a crop top, or decorated with a body piercing.
Whatever your feelings about belly buttons, one thing’s for sure – it once joined you to your mother. The umbilical cord is severed at birth to leave just a small clamped stump that progressively withers and falls away a week or two later.
What you’re left with, in most cases, is a small wrinkled depression. That’s if you have an “innie”, as most of us – 90% apparently – do. From this point, the belly button seems to become redundant – other than to gather dust and fluff.
But that’s not the whole story – your navel has more depth to it than just a few millimetres.
The umbilicus is an access point for the vessels carrying blood to and from the foetus. These have come from the placenta and run through the umbilical cord, coated in Wharton’s jelly – a gelatinous connective tissue contained in the cord that insulates and protects them.
There are normally three vessels within the cord. The one carrying oxygen and nutrients to the fetus is the umbilical vein. It passes through the umbilicus and feeds into the developing fetal circulation. There are also two umbilical arteries, though these carry deoxygenated blood and waste products, flowing in the other direction back to the placenta.
This circulation is not needed after the baby is born, and once disconnected from the placenta the umbilical vessels naturally close up. But the little stump of cut cord left clinging on can still be of use for a short time, especially in newborn babies who are poorly. The vessels can have drip lines inserted and be used for infusions of medicine, or have blood samples taken from them for testing.
The umbilicus is a portal in the wall of the abdomen – it’s a little-known fact that during your embryonic development your intestines actually have to leave your abdominal cavity because of limited space, but return a few weeks later. They do so via the umbilicus, passing into the cord.
As a result the umbilicus is not just an access point, but a point of weakness. An umbilical hernia occurs if a section of intestine pokes through any gap. This may require an operation to correct it.
Poor Sister Mary Joseph Dempsey. She was a nun who devoted much of her life to the care of patients in a hospital in Minnesota. She trained as a nurse, later becoming a surgical assistant to the doctor William Mayo. It was during this tenure that she highlighted an interesting observation.
At the time (the late 19th century), cancers of the abdomen and pelvis were typically diagnosed much later, and unfortunately were often more extensive. We call this process metastasis, where a cancer starts in one organ or location, then spreads to another.
Mary Joseph noted that some patients with metastatic cancer had a new palpable swelling or nodule in their umbilicus. She did the noble deed of reporting this to Mayo, who fairly evidently hadn’t noted it himself. He went on to rather ignominiously publish these findings under his own name, without giving due credit to his esteemed colleague. It was only after the deaths of Dempsey and Mayo – both in 1939 – that another doctor, Hamilton Bailey, rightly named the finding Sister Mary Joseph’s nodule.
The nodule is firm, of variable colouring, and actually arises from spread of the cancer to the umbilical tissue. It’s not seen as commonly these days, since more cancers are now diagnosed earlier before extensive spreading occurs.
Other signs can be observed in the navel that have a footing in mythology. One example allows us to draw a connection between the liver and the umbilicus.
The skin around the navel has beds of superficial veins that feed back towards the deeper circulation. They actually drain blood into the hepatic portal vein, a large vessel that is heading into the liver, chock-full of nutrients absorbed from the gut.
If the pressure in the portal vein becomes too high (mostly as a result of liver diseases, like alcohol cirrhosis) pressure builds in the connecting vessels too. Veins have thinner walls than arteries and tend to balloon under pressure.
As a result, the normally small veins around the navel dilate in size and become visible beneath the skin, fanning in all directions. This sign, like a head replete with snakes for hair, is named caput medusae, or Medusa’s head. In Greek mythology, the gorgon Medusa whose head was severed by the hero Perseus, had the ability to turn anyone who beheld her gaze to stone.
And on that topic, all that dirt, debris and dead skin in our navels should also get an honourable (or maybe dishonourable) mention – prolonged accumulation of this material within the cavity can make it harden over time, forming a stony mass. We call this an omphalolith, or umbilical stone.
So, the umbilicus is something of a reliable crystal ball in diagnosing internal illnesses. But as to whether you regard it as an attractive part of your own anatomy, one has to ask the question: are you innie or outie? – The Conversation/Rappler.com

The Novo Nordisk Foundation, Wellcome, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced the research partnership, focused particularly on finding affordable solutions for people in low and middle-income countries, in Denmark on Monday, May 6.
Each will put $100 million into the three-year initiative.
A key aim is to “break down barriers between often isolated areas of research”, said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, chief executive officer of the Novo Nordisk Foundation.
For example, COVID-19 showed that obesity can be a risk factor for the severity of some infectious diseases, while extreme weather events linked to climate change can cause food insecurity, leaving undernourished children even more vulnerable to killer diseases such as measles and cholera.
The partners said advances in nutritional science and understanding the gut microbiome opened the door to understanding more about “the impact over- and under-nutrition have on all aspects of health and development”.
The Novo Nordisk Foundation has a controlling interest in the drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO), whose blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy has brought in billions for the foundation since its launch in 2021.
The partners said the initiative was important given faltering global attention to health post-pandemic. Wellcome’s chief executive, John-Arne Røttingen, also said it was about tackling “market failures” and signalling a global commitment to equitable access to medical advances.
The funding will also include support for researchers based in low- and middle-income countries, and the partners said they are on the lookout for private, philanthropic and public partners.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/orangutan-use-medicinal-plant-treat-wound-intrigues-scientists/,Orangutan’s use of medicinal plant to treat wound intrigues scientists,"In June 2022, a male Sumatran orangutan named Rakus sustained a facial wound below the right eye, apparently during a fight with another male orangutan at the Suaq Balimbing research site, a protected rainforest area in Indonesia. What Rakus did three days later really caught the attention of scientists.
Researchers on Thursday, May 2, described observing how Rakus appeared to treat the wound using a plant known for its pain-relieving properties and for supporting wound healing due to its antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal and antioxidant qualities.
The orangutan chewed the plant’s leaves to produce a liquid that Rakus repeatedly smeared on the wound and then applied the chewed-up plant material directly to the injury, much like a wound plaster administered by doctors, according to primatologist and cognitive biologist Isabelle Laumer of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany.
Rakus also ate the plant, an evergreen vine commonly called Akar Kuning – scientific name Fibraurea tinctoria, added Laumer, lead author of the study published in the journal Scientific Reports. This plant is rarely eaten by orangutans in this peat swamp forest area, home to about 150 critically endangered Sumatran orangutans.
“To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of active wound treatment with a plant species with medical properties by a wild animal,” said study senior author Caroline Schuppli, an evolutionary biologist at the institute.
Rakus, believed to have been born in 1989, is a flanged male, with large cheek pads on both sides of the face – secondary male sexual characteristics. Rakus was one of the area’s dominant males.
The researchers said the orangutan’s wound self-treatment did not appear to be happenstance.
“His behavior appeared to be intentional. He selectively treated his facial wound on his right flange with the plant juice, and no other body parts. The behavior was repeated several times, not only plant juice but later also more-solid plant material was applied until the wound was fully covered. The entire process took a considerable amount of time,” Laumer said.
The wound never showed signs of infection and closed within five days, the researchers said.
“The observation suggests that the cognitive capacities that are needed for the behavior – active wound treatment with plants – may be as old as the last common ancestor of orangutans and humans,” Schuppli said. “However, what these cognitive capacities exactly are remains to be investigated. Whereas this observation shows that orangutans are capable of treating their wounds with plants, we don’t know to what extent they understand the process.”
The last common ancestor of orangutans and humans lived about 13 million years ago.
Orangutans are one of the world’s great apes – the closest living relatives of humans – alongside chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas. Orangutans are the least closely related to humans of them but still share approximately 97% of our DNA.
“It is possible that wound treatment with Fibraurea tinctoria emerges through accidental individual innovation. Individuals may accidentally touch their wounds while feeding on Fibraurea tinctoria and thus unintentionally apply the plant’s juice to their wounds,” Laumer said.
“But it may also be,” Laumer added, “that Rakus has learned this behavior from other orangutans in his birth area.”
This plant, widely distributed across China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia, is used in traditional medicine to treat conditions such as malaria.
Orangutan means “person of the forest” in the Indonesian and Malay languages, and these apes are the world’s biggest arboreal mammal. Orangutans, adapted to living in trees, live more solitary lives than other great apes, sleeping and eating fruit in the forest canopy and swinging from branch to branch.
“Orangutans have high cognitive abilities, in particular in the area of physical cognition,” Schuppli said. “They are known to be excellent problem-solvers. Wild orangutans acquire their skill sets via observational social learning, and skills get passed on from generation to generation. The population where this observation was made is known for its rich cultural repertoire, including tool use in different contexts.”",Reuters,"May 3, 2024 11:54 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/breast-cancer-screening-should-begin-age-40-united-states-panel-says/,"Breast cancer screening should begin at age 40, US panel says","NEW YORK, USA – Women at average risk for breast cancer should get screening mammograms every other year starting at age 40, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) said on Tuesday, April 30, cementing insurance coverage for the procedure for that age group under the law.
The USPSTF’s influential recommendation, published in JAMA, reverses its controversial 2009 guidance that breast cancer screening should begin at age 50.
Its updated guidelines bring it in line with other major organizations that say women at average risk of breast cancer should start screening at age 40.
Those organizations include the American Cancer Society, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.
A 2016 update from the USPSTF had said women could start screening at age 40 if they and their doctors so desired, but that update led “to widespread confusion for both physicians and patients,” said Dr. Evita Singh, Director of Breast Imaging at Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit.
US insurers are already required by law to fully cover mammograms for women over age 40 who want them, but the USPSTF’s recommendation will now ensure the continuity of that coverage under the Affordable Care Act beyond next year.
By lowering the age to start biennial screening to 40, the USPSTF is acknowledging evidence that more women under the age of 50 are now getting diagnosed with breast cancer.
Black women, in particular, stand to benefit from earlier screening, experts say. Breast cancer mortality is 40% higher among Black women than among white women, and Black women are more likely to get breast cancer at younger ages, the USPSTF report noted.
“There should hopefully be less confusion on the ‘right’ age to consider screening for average risk people,” said Deirdre Saulet, vice president of cancer care at Carrum Health, a digital marketplace for employers to purchase bundled healthcare services.
“I would anticipate that a greater proportion of the primary care doctors in the country would be recommending starting at age 40 for women of average risk,” said Dr. Carol Mangione, chair of the USPSTF.
Nearly half of all women have dense breasts, which increases the risk for breast cancer, but the task force says there is not yet enough evidence to recommend for or against additional screening with breast ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging in these individuals.

https://www.rappler.com/science/ed-yong-an-immense-world-review-understanding-beyond-eyes/,Ed Yong’s ‘An Immense World’ review: Understanding the world beyond our eyes,"My friends often told me I looked like a turtle during our university days.
There I was working towards a chemistry degree, going around the campus with my heavy backpack, which almost always contained thick science textbooks. The books made my back hurt a lot, yes, but I treated them as my security blanket.
Textbooks are complete and detailed; they’re much easier to understand than our lectures that had impossibly compressed topics. When things got difficult to understand in the classroom (which happened all the time), I flipped through my book’s pages, looking for clarity.
Reading Ed Yong’s An Immense World nostalgically reminded me of the big fat science textbooks that I lugged around for years. In thirteen chapters, Yong gives clarity to the worlds of other animals, carefully explaining each sense — like sight, smell, and taste — that has so far been discovered in all known species.
Ed Yong is a science journalist and a Pulitzer winner for his coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic. But in this book, he tells stories of countless scientists and their experiments — mostly sensory biologists who dedicated their life’s work to understanding how animals sense their worlds.
But Yong uses less images than in textbooks, and in turn, more imagery (the book’s introduction was such a pleasure), less scientific terms (the author was apologetic), less numbers, and (thank God) zero equations.
In the process, Yong gives us a treat: leading us into worlds beyond what our eyes can see, taking the route of other species’ senses.
Describing the sensory worlds of other animals was no easy feat. Yong could have made a documentary instead like most features on animals. But that would defeat the purpose of the book: to look beyond the primary sense of humans, which is our sight.
Yong invites us to travel the world beyond our human senses. He describes this as visiting parallel universes and alternate realities. But to me, it was also like going into another dimension, or at least the attempt to.
As species living in a three-dimensional space, we can never know what it would be like to live in the (hypothetical) fourth dimension and to fully see four-dimensional objects. In the same way, we can never sense the world how other species sense it. But we can try.
The book begins – and intelligently so – with the sensory world of dogs, man’s best friend. With dogs having been domesticated for so long, we think we already know them well enough. But we always forget that dogs primarily perceive the world not by sight but by smell.
We often prevent our dogs from taking pauses and detours during walks. Doing so deprives them of exploring interesting smells and enjoying their own sensory worlds — proof of our entrapment in our own primary sense of sight. It’s like stopping a human friend from appreciating nice views.
To further drive this point home, Yong brings up our use of the English language, where we often use visual words like in I see your point and we share the same view. Futures are either bright or dark. We are oblivious to things in our blind spots.
A similar thing interestingly happens in our understanding of colors.
I have studied colors most extensively in my physics and chemistry classes. And in those classes, we learned to categorize the different existing colors under visible light, which is a part of a larger range of radiation called the electromagnetic spectrum.
But scientists have discovered that other species like birds and bees see other colors under ultraviolet, another part of the spectrum beyond visible light. Though visible to other species, we categorize ultraviolet separately from visible light, because it is invisible to us.
For so long, physicists and chemists – and myself – have been trying to understand the world trapped in our own sense of sight. With Yong’s book, I realized that through the senses of other species, biology allows us to see beyond what is visible to us humans, and in turn allows us to see worlds beyond ours – a mind-blowing realization for a science nerd like me.
To my delight, Yong let his readers live vicariously through the scientists he spoke with, who shared their experiments and discoveries with him. But the author tries his best to exclude the draggy and nitty gritty part of experiments.
Perhaps, as he was a science student himself, he knew this would give readers a chance to enjoy the scientific method (I, indeed, enjoyed it), and allow them to share excitement in the scientists’ Eureka moments.
I particularly appreciated the parts in the book where a scientist says, “they’re misunderstood,” when referring to a species they were studying, like spiders and bats commonly perceived as villains – proof that scientists are passionate about what they do. (I say the same thing with my favorite species – the sharks.)
And my wonderment peaked at the times when scientists learned something new – like why we can’t seem to catch flies; how migratory birds know exactly where to go; and why we have not one, but two nostrils, and how it’s the same reason why snakes have forked tongues.
And that’s to cite just a few of the questions answered in the book.
Yong discusses many other scientific facts and discoveries, citing several scientists and experiments, so much so that the book has filled forty-five pages for bibliography. (In my experience, academic papers’ bibliographies usually fill around three pages – seven pages is already a lot.)
But I can say, Yong’s book doesn’t aim to just overwhelm readers with information, but allows us to enjoy and appreciate vast worlds beyond our sensory bubbles.
It seeks to make us realize that no species is above or below another, that in peeking into the sensory worlds of animals, we see that there is no superiority or inferiority, but only diversity.",Laurice Angeles,"Apr 21, 2024 10:07 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/experts-urge-stricter-rules-against-e-cigarettes-vaping/,"Health experts urge stricter rules against e-cigarettes, vaping","MANILA, Philippines – Three health experts warned that electronic cigarettes and vape pens possibly posed more danger than the usual cigarette sticks, specially now that there is an aggressive marketing push to lure young people to the habit.
In a roundtable forum of journalists, public health experts, and young leaders, last April 11, health advocates warned that continued use of e-cigarettes and vaping pens could lead to the development relatively new lung disease that could start at a young age. They warned of irreversible damage to the lungs, which may need lung transplant surgery.
The health experts were Dr. Maricar Limpin, chair of the steering committee at Philippine Coalition on the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases; Dr. Riz Gonzales, chair of the tobacco control advocacy group of the Philippine Pediatric Society; and Au Quilala, advocacy and partnerships manager, Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development.
Cigarette smoking and vaping were compared in the forum.
Diseases associated with traditional smoking like lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CPD), start at age 40 and up.  For smokers of e-cigarette and vape pens, they could develop even during their teenage years the lung disease called, EVALI, or E-Cigarette, Vaping Product, Use Lung Injury.
EVALI symptoms are: shortness of breath; cough; chest pain; fever and chills; diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain; rapid heartbeat; and rapid and shallow breathing.
The forum hosted by Vital Undustries, an NGO, also tackled the pressing issues on the aggressive sale and marketing promotion of e-cigarettes and vape products to the youth.
A cause of concern, they said, was a trend to attract young people to vapes and e-cigarettes by positioning these “cool” to use.
Gonzales said it was wrong for manufacturers to claim that vaping was risk-free and as a good alternative to smoking. “It’s not true,” said said, noting the aggressive marketing of vape producers.
Because of the disruption brought about by the pandemic, there is no available data on deaths and injuries arising from use of vaping products in the Philippines. But doctors noticed, a sudden rise of EVALI cases because of increased vape activity.
Shortly before the outbreak of the global pandemic, or sometime in November, 2019, the Department of Health reported the first EVALI case in the country – a 16-year old girl from the Visayas, who was using both cigarettes and vape. In 2020, or shortly before the pandemic, the US had more than 3,000 reported EVALI cases with 66 deaths.
Quilala said there was a need to revisit existing public policies on vaping, which include the possible return to 21 years from the current 18 years the legal age to vape and the mandate for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), not the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), to regulate vaping in the country. She also called for stricter implementation of the vaping laws and regulations.
“According to the latest Global Youth Tobacco Survey, one out of every seven Filipino youth aged 13-15 is now using vapes. This alarming trend is not a coincidence but a result of the tobacco industry’s calculated marketing tactics targeting the youth,” said Limpin.
“We’ll not sit idly by and turn a blind eye to the predatory practices of this industry. By allowing the Philippines to position itself as a manufacturing hub, we are essentially paving the way for an EVALI epidemic,” Limpin said.
Limpin said that the Philippines has at least seven recorded EVALI cases, but the number could go up suddenly as many young people develop addiction to the substances and chemicals used in vaping products.",Rappler.com,"Apr 17, 2024 12:32 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/surgeons-perform-first-pig-to-human-kidney-transplant/,US surgeons perform first pig-to-human kidney transplant,"A 62-year-man with end-stage renal disease has become the first human to receive a new kidney from a genetically modified pig, doctors from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston announced on Thursday, March 21.
The four-hour surgery, performed on March 16, “marks a major milestone in the quest to provide more readily available organs to patients,” the hospital said in a statement.
The patient, Richard Slayman of Weymouth, Massachusetts, is recovering well and expected to be discharged soon, the hospital said.
Experts are keenly interested in long-term results of the groundbreaking animal-to-human transplant, said Dr. Jim Kim, director of kidney and pancreas transplantation with USC Transplant Institute in Los Angeles.
Slayman had received a transplant of a human kidney at the same hospital in 2018 after seven years on dialysis, but the organ failed after five years and he had resumed dialysis treatments.
The kidney was provided by eGenesis of Cambridge, Massachusetts, from a pig that had been genetically edited to remove genes harmful to a human recipient and add certain human genes to improve compatibility. The company also inactivated viruses inherent to pigs that have the potential to infect humans.
Kidneys from similarly edited pigs raised by eGenesis had successfully been transplanted into monkeys that were kept alive for an average of 176 days, and in one case for more than two years, researchers reported in October in the journal Nature.
Drugs used to help prevent rejection of the pig organ by the patient’s immune system included an experimental antibody called tegoprubart, developed by Eledon Pharmaceuticals ELDN.O.
The surgery marks progress in xenotransplantation – the transplanting of organs or tissues from one species to another – said Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute, who was not involved in the case.
The field “is marching closer to becoming an alternative source of organs for the many hundreds of thousands suffering from kidney failure,” he said in an email.
According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, more than 100,000 people in the US await an organ for transplant, with kidneys in the greatest demand.
NYU surgeons had previously transplanted pig kidneys into brain-dead people.
Montgomery said transplant centers are taking different approaches in terms of gene edits and medications, adding that “another big step will be when the FDA authorizes clinical trials so we may better understand what will work best for patients on our waiting lists.”

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/how-fast-safely-during-ramadan-what-science-shows-the-conversation/,How to fast safely during Ramadan – what the science shows,"For 1.9 billion Muslims, Ramadan is the ninth and holiest Islamic month and this year starts on March 11. During the 30 days of Ramadan, many Muslims fast, refraining from food, drink, smoking and sex, between dawn and sunset each day.
Fasting is only compulsory for adult Muslims. There are exemptions for people who are sick, elderly, pregnant, breastfeeding, menstruating or travelling.
As Ramadan slowly moves across seasons, the fasting days are getting cooler and shorter than last year, at least for those in the northern hemisphere and those close to the equator. Regardless of where you live, it is important to drink plenty of fluids when breaking your fast at sunset and before you start your fast at dawn.
Scientific research has shown that fasting is good for your health. Animal studies have shown fasting results in longer life and better health. In humans, research suggests body weight, blood glucose, blood cholesterol and blood pressure all improve with fasting.
In terms of mental health, Ramadan fasting improves mental health and lessens depression symptoms. Of course, there is an immense spiritual benefit too.
Many homes prepare traditional foods at the time of breaking the fast, often with fried food and sweets. A healthy alternative would be fresh fruit; dates have always been a common tradition.
One of the benefits of breaking fast with fruit is that it provides plenty of glucose for the organs, especially the brain.
Similarly, at dawn, a meal with protein, fat and complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains and beans, can be useful as fats can slow digestion, giving a fasting person a feeling of being full for longer. Complex carbohydrates also provide energy for longer.
Fluid intake is vital, especially if the weather is warmer and the fasting person is planning strenuous exercise.
Lifestyle choices are important for your health. Apart from diet, exercise is important, too. Most exercises can be performed in Ramadan, but don’t expect to keep to your pre-Ramadan levels.
If you feel dehydrated, too tired or weak, then stop. A good time to exercise is in the morning or later afternoon when the outdoor temperature could be lower. However, this would not affect indoor exercises.
People whose professions require them to be physically active need to be careful that they don’t get dehydrated or suffer heat exhaustion – or worse, heatstroke.
Workers in hot climates need to be careful during the hottest part of the day (12 noon to 3pm). If you do need to go out a lot, be sensible and try to stay in shaded areas, if possible. When opening your fast, drink cool fluids and add a pinch of salt too, as excess sweating makes us lose salt. And wear light clothes.
Smoking and vaping are not permitted when fasting, so if you smoke or vape, it might be a good time to try to quit.
Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the world. Think of using nicotine gum to help you quit when you break your fast. Islamic scholars allow the use of nicotine patches while fasting.
If fasting would worsen a health condition, you should avoid fasting. However, many people with chronic diseases do fast without any problems.
If you have an illness and you want to fast, you should consult your doctor first, especially if you have a chronic health condition, such as diabetes, a heart condition or hypertension (high blood pressure).
If fasting makes you more ill, how is it beneficial if you can’t perform your normal acts of worship, or you need to be taken to the hospital?","Feisal Subhan, The Conversation","Mar 18, 2024 1:00 PM PHT"

The cash gifts are mandated under the Centenarian Act of 2016. Cadiz Mayor Salvador Escalante Jr. said there is a local ordinance, too, which mandates city hall to recognize and gift centenarians with cash.
Lola Tiling, as everyone calls her in Cadiz, has been a prominent manghihilot (traditional Filipino healer who practices indigenous massage therapy) in Sicaba, some 18.5 kilometers from downtown Cadiz, for almost seven decades.
In an interview with Rappler on Wednesday, March 13, she recalled different turning points in her life, including her colorful love life with her late husband, Florentino Alimpolos.
She has a sharp memory. Lola Tiling, who only completed Grade 2 at the Sicaba Elementary School, still remembers the name of her last teacher, “Ma’am Lourdes de la Peña.”
Her life has been characterized by hardships, from being a poor girl during World War II to raising nine children, and being a grandmother to 15 grandchildren,
Lola Tiling said she never experienced a comfortable life until now.
Raising nine children was no easy task, and she took on numerous odd jobs to support her family amid poverty and other challenges. In her own words, she said she was a “Jack of all trades.”
Reaching 101 years, Lola Tiling, the fourth of six children, considers herself truly “beyond blessed.”
Longevity seems to run in Lola Tiling’s family. Lola Tiling’s three older siblings also lived to be more than 100 years old.
She recalls that her eldest brother, Sotero, lived to be 110, while her sisters Rebecca and Dinky lived to be 107 and 104, respectively.
Many wonder what keeps her strong and sharp-minded.
Lola Tiling shared with Rappler what she called her “secrets” to longevity:
Lola Tiling said bras are uncomfortable, and she believes wearing one is not good for a woman’s health.
All her life, she said, she has never been administered with vaccines and neither has she been hospitalized, a personal record she attributes to her longetivity secrets.
During the worst period of the COVID-19 pandemic, her daughter, 51-year-old Vangeline Alimpolos-Soledad, said Lola Tiling just refused to be jabbed.
One of Lola Tiling’s folk beliefs is that whenever she performs hilot on someone, she releases a healing force or positive energy, beneficial for both her body and her client’s well-being.
She said she never demands a specific payment for her hilot services, and only accepts pasanag or sanag (donations).
Mayor Escalante said many people, especially in Sicaba, have claimed to have been cured by the centenarian manghihilot.
He referred to her as a “legend, a heritage, and a treasure” a Cadiz who deserves utmost care.

“Initial results show promising neuron spike detection,” Musk said in a post on social media platform X on Monday.
Spikes are activity by neurons, which the National Institute of Health describes as cells that use electrical and chemical signals to send information around the brain and to the body.
The US Food and Drug Administration had given the company clearance last year to conduct its first trial to test its implant on humans. In September, Neuralink said it received approval for recruitment for the human trial for paralysis patients.
The study uses a robot to surgically place a brain-computer interface (BCI) implant in a region of the brain that controls the intention to move, Neuralink said previously, adding that its initial goal is to enable people to control a computer cursor or keyboard using their thoughts alone.
The implants’ “ultra-fine” threads help transmit signals in participants’ brains, Neuralink has said.
The first product from Neuralink would be called Telepathy, Musk said in a separate post on X.
The startup’s PRIME Study is a trial for its wireless brain-computer interface to evaluate the safety of the implant and surgical robot.
Neuralink did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for further details.
The company has faced calls for scrutiny regarding its safety protocols. Reuters reported earlier this month that the company was fined for violating US Department of Transportation (DOT) rules regarding the movement of hazardous materials.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/ban-flavored-vapes-who-says-urging-tobacco-style-controls/,"Ban flavored vapes, WHO says, urging tobacco-style controls","LONDON, United Kingdom – The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday, December 14, urged governments to treat e-cigarettes similarly to tobacco and ban all flavors, threatening cigarette companies’ bets on smoking alternatives.
Some researchers, campaigners and governments see e-cigarettes, or vapes, as a key tool in reducing the death and disease caused by smoking. But the UN agency said “urgent measures” were needed to control them.
Citing studies, it said there was insufficient evidence that vapes helped smokers quit, that they were harmful to health and that they could drive nicotine addiction among non-smokers, especially children and young people.
More 13-15 year olds are using vapes than adults in all WHO regions helped by aggressive marketing, it continued.
“Kids are being recruited and trapped at an early age to use e-cigarettes and may get hooked to nicotine,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, urging countries to implement strict measures.
The WHO called for changes, including bans on all flavoring agents like menthol, and the application of tobacco control measures to vapes. Those include high taxes and bans on use in public places.
The WHO has no authority over national regulations, and only provides guidance. But its recommendations are often adopted voluntarily.
The WHO and some other anti-tobacco organizations are pushing for stricter regulations on newer nicotine products, taking aim at the alternatives on which some cigarette giants like Philip Morris International PM.N and British American Tobacco BATS.L are basing their future strategies.
Tobacco company Imperial Brands IMB.L and vape firm ANDS said vapes pose significantly lower health risks than tobacco and help reduce its harms, while flavors are key in encouraging smokers to switch – a position shared by some tobacco control advocates.
“Regulating vapes like cigarettes would only serve to reinforce misunderstandings about the relative risks of vaping and send the wrong message to smokers,” said Marina Murphy, senior director of scientific and medical affairs at ANDS, adding the WHO’s position was “detached from reality”.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/cop28-health-experts-say-cut-fossil-fuel-use-save-millions-lives/,"Cut fossil fuel use to save millions of lives, health experts say","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – Countries must put people’s health at the center of their plans to fight climate change and phase out fossil fuels as a way to tackle air pollution and diseases being aggravated by rising temperatures, health specialists told the United Nations climate summit.
At the COP28 conference in Dubai, more than 120 nations signed a declaration to boost health-related climate finance, but the document made no mention of fossil fuels – the main source of climate-warming emissions.
Climate campaigners, researchers, and health policymakers said phasing out the use of fossil fuels was vital to saving millions of lives each year and called on governments to address the link between emissions and air quality, and include measurable goals or targets.
“We need to integrate climate change as a core component to enable us, as the first-line responders, to respond, detect, and treat climate-related health impacts,” said Omnia El Omrani, a climate and health policy expert from Egypt.
Despite an increase globally in illnesses and deaths linked to fossil fuel burning such as asthma, lung infections, and respiratory diseases, he said health authorities in many countries do not connect the trend to greenhouse gas emissions.
An estimated 5.13 million excess deaths per year globally are attributable to ambient air pollution from fossil fuel use and therefore could potentially be avoided by phasing out fossil fuel, according a new study published November by the British Medical Journal.
Despite that, the issue was missing from two-thirds of the national climate plans submitted to the United Nations, known as nationally determined contributions, according to an October report by the Global Climate and Health Alliance (GCHA).
“The threats to health resulting from climate change are immediate and present. However, for too long, health has been a footnote to climate discussion,” the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said at the first ever Health Day at COP28 in Dubai, calling for countries to include health in their climate action plans.
Rising temperatures are also pushing mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, and malaria into regions that were not previously affected by them, Tedros said.
Climate campaigners also criticized the failure of some high-emitting nations such as India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa to endorse the COP28 Health Declaration on Climate and Health.
“[That] carries huge consequences for the populations of those countries in addition to the emissions that need to be addressed globally,” said Jess Beagley, policy lead for the GCHA, a coalition of health nongovernmental organizations and health professionals.
The alliance called the declaration’s failure to mention fossil fuels a “glaring omission.”
It did include the announcement of $1 billion in pledges from governments, charities, and development banks to mobilize finance for climate and health in developing countries, where climate-related health risks are especially high.
The funding initiative includes $300 million from the Global Fund, $100 million from the Rockefeller Foundation to support climate and health solutions, and a 54-million-pound ($69 million) pledge from the British government.
At present, health-focused climate action only receives 2% of adaptation funding and 0.5% of climate funding.
Health and climate campaigners say that is nowhere near enough to tackle the growing burden of tropical diseases as the world warms, along with other climate-driven health threats including malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress.
But climate finance to ramp up cleaner energy access to people across the world must be stepped up, a push that would bring immediate health benefits with it, campaigners say.
About four out of every five families in Africa still cook with polluting stoves, said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency.
Access to cleaner cooking alternatives could dramatically slash emissions – and improve air quality, said Birol, calling on richer nations to fund just transition initiatives in poorer nations.
Tedros urged the world’s health sector, which accounts for about 5% of global emissions, to lead by example on reducing its carbon footprint.
“The health workforce is one of the largest in the world, present in almost every community,” he told journalists.
“We have a role to speak up on behalf of the populations we serve to raise ambition for a cleaner, greener, and healthier future.”",Reuters,"Dec 5, 2023 2:55 PM PHT"

These are just a few of the ways that public health has been impacted and compounded by climate change – a focus for the first time ever at the annual United Nations climate summit COP28.
Government ministers are expected to discuss ways they can protect people from climate-driven health threats, which now threaten to undo decades of progress in public health.
From 2030, experts expect that just four of these threats – malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress – will push global death tolls up by 250,000 per year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
“Extreme weather events are becoming extreme health events,” said Martin Edlund, chief executive officer of global health nonprofit Malaria No More.
Here’s how climate change is harming people’s health across the world today, and what countries might expect in the future.
Mosquitoes that carry viruses including dengue, malaria, West Nile, and Zika are shifting into new parts of the world as warmer temperatures and heavy rain create more hospitable conditions for them to breed.
Reported dengue cases have grown from around half a million in 2000 to more than 5 million in 2019, according to the WHO.
Just this year, cases in Brazil are up 73% against the five-year average, said Edlund, with Bangladesh suffering a record dengue outbreak.
Climate change is also having an unpredictable impact on malaria, with 5 million more cases registered in 2022 than the previous year – reaching a total of 249 million, the WHO’s World Malaria Report found.
Floods in Pakistan last year, for example, led to a 400% increase in malaria cases in the country, the report said.
The disease has also spread into the highlands of Africa that previously had been cold for mosquitoes.
Two new malaria vaccines expected to be available next year offer some hope of combating the scourge.
Storms and flooding wrought by climate change are allowing other infectious water-borne diseases to proliferate as well.
After decades of progress against cholera, an intestinal infection spread by contaminated food and water, case numbers are rising again, including in countries that had all but extirpated the disease.
Without treatment, cholera can kill within hours.
In 2022, 44 countries reported cholera cases, a 25% increase over 2021, according to the WHO, which noted the role played by cyclones, floods, and drought in cutting off access to clean water and helping bacteria to thrive.
Recent outbreaks have also been far deadlier, with fatality rates now at the highest recorded level in over a decade, the WHO said.
Diarrhea, too, receives a boost from climate change, with increasingly erratic rainfall – resulting in either wet or dry conditions – yielding a higher risk, research has found.
Diarrhea is the world’s second leading cause of death among children under 5, after pneumonia, claiming the lives of more than half a million kids every year.
Heat stress – one of the more obvious health impacts of global warming – is projected to impact hundreds of millions of people as temperatures continue to climb through the next few decades.
With the world already about 1.1°C (2°F) warmer than the average preindustrial temperature, people in 2022 experienced about 86 days on average of dangerously high temperatures, a report from the Lancet medical journal found last month.
If the world warms by 2°C above preindustrial levels, the report said, yearly heat deaths could more than quadruple.
A July study in the journal Nature Medicine estimated that some 61,000 people died during European heat waves in the summer of 2022.
The heat has also made forests drier, fueling extreme wildfires that have swept across large swathes of the world in recent years.
During the decade starting in 2010, more than 2 billion people were exposed to at least one day per year of unhealthy air pollution from fire smoke, according to a September study in the journal Nature. That was up by 6.8% compared with the previous decade.
In the United States, wildfire air pollution now kills somewhere between 4,000 and 28,000 people annually, according to the American Thoracic Society.",Reuters,"Dec 3, 2023 8:30 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/what-we-know-about-china-respiratory-illness-surge/,EXPLAINER: What do we know about China’s respiratory illness surge?,"SHANGHAI, China – A request by the World Health Organization for more information on a surge in respiratory illnesses and clusters of pneumonia in children in China has attracted global attention.
Health authorities have not detected any unusual or novel pathogens, the WHO later said, and doctors and public health researchers say there is no evidence for international alarm.
Authorities in Taiwan, however, this week advised the elderly, very young and those with poor immunity to avoid travel to China.
The following is what we know about the surge in illness in the world’s second most populous country so far, and why experts think there is no need to panic.
The rise in respiratory illnesses comes as China braces for its first full winter season since it lifted strict COVID-19 restrictions in December last year.
The spike in illness came into the spotlight when the WHO asked China for more information last week, citing a report by the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) on clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia in children.
Some social media users have also posted photos of children receiving intravenous drips in hospital, while media in cities such as Xian in the northwest have posted videos of crowded hospitals, fanning concerns potential strains on the healthcare system.
The National Health Commission told a news conference on November 13 that there was an increase in incidence of respiratory disease without providing further details.
WHO China told Reuters in an email that “Chinese health authorities advised that the current numbers they are observing is not greater than the peak in the most recent cold season prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The data suggests the increase is linked to the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions along with the circulation of known pathogens such as mycoplasma pneumoniae, a common bacterial infection that typically affects younger children and which has circulated since May.
Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus have been in circulation since October.
IS mycoplasma pneumoniae a big worry?
One concern about the surge in respiratory illness is mycoplasma pneumoniae, which has also spiked in other countries.
Maria Van Kerkhove, COVID-19 Technical Lead at the World Health Organization told reporters on Wednesday that mycoplasma pneumonia is not a reportable disease to the WHO, and it was on the rise for the last couple of months but now appears to be declining.
“We’re following up through our clinical networks and working with clinicians in China to better understand resistance to antibiotics, which is a problem across the world, but is a particular problem in the Western Pacific and South East Asia region,” she said.
Rajib Dasgupta, an epidemiologist and professor of community health at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, told Reuters in some cases there may be serious complications from infection caused by mycoplasma pneumoniae, but most people will recover without antibiotics.
Doctors in China and experts abroad are not too worried about the situation in China, noting many other countries saw similar increases in respiratory diseases after easing pandemic measures.
“The cases that we are seeing is nothing unusual at the moment, because it’s still the same cough, colds, fever presentation, and the good thing about it is that it’s actually treatable,” said Cecille Brion, head of the pediatrics department at Raffles Medical Group Beijing.
Van Kerkhove said that the rise in cases was expected.
“We are seeing, in general, an increase in respiratory infections around the world. We do tend to see increases in children because they’re the school-aged children, and in the northern hemisphere it’s the autumn already. We’re entering the winter months,” she said.",Reuters,"Dec 1, 2023 9:30 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/us-life-expectancy-climbs-2022-after-covid-19-retreat/,US life expectancy climbs in 2022 after COVID-19 retreat,"US babies born in 2022 gained roughly a year in life expectancy compared with babies born a year earlier, federal data showed on Wednesday, November 29, marking progress after two consecutive years of declines largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Life expectancy at birth for 2022 newborns was 77.5 years, up from 76.4 in 2021 but still lower than the 78.8 years expected for those born in 2019, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests.
It will take “some time before we’re back to where we were in 2019, before the pandemic,” said Elizabeth Arias, a CDC researcher who worked on the report.
The study estimated babies’ life expectancy if mortality conditions when they were born were to persist throughout their lives.
“There were positive outcomes all around… all the groups by race and sex experienced increases in life expectancy,” Arias said.
Life expectancy increased over 2021 levels by the most for American Indian and Alaska Native non-Hispanic newborns, by 2.3 years, from 65.6 to 67.9, followed by an increase of 2.2 years for Hispanic newborns from 77.8 to 80.
Black non-Hispanic Americans, who were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, had life expectancy increase by 1.6 years, from 71.2 to 72.8, resulting primarily from decreases in mortality due to COVID-19, followed by declines in deaths from heart disease, homicide, diabetes, and cancer.
Life expectancy increased by 1 year for Asian non-Hispanic infants to 84.5 years, and by 0.8 year for White non-Hispanic babies to 77.5.
In all groups, previous declines in mortality due to COVID-19 explained more than 80% of the increases in life expectancy, according to the report.
Declines in deaths from heart disease, unintentional injuries, cancer, and homicide also contributed to longer life expectancy overall, but their impact varied.
In the American Indian and Alaska Native population and the Hispanic population, for example, increases in life expectancy would have been greater if not for offsetting increases in mortality due to unintentional injuries.
Improvements in life expectancy for non-Hispanic Black babies were offset by increases in mortality due to perinatal conditions, congenital malformations, kidney disease, nutritional deficiencies, and legal intervention, a reference to deaths due to injuries inflicted by police or other law enforcement agents.
As usual, life expectancy remains longer for females. In 2020, the difference between the sexes reached 6 years, a level not seen since 1996. In 2022, that gap had narrowed to 5.4 years, down from 5.8 years in 2021.
The data for 2022 is provisional, meaning that it may change and has several limitations, including a difference in timeliness in submitting death certificates by some jurisdictions.",Reuters,"Nov 29, 2023 2:57 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/surgeons-new-york-world-first-eye-transplant/,Surgeons in New York announce world’s first eye transplant,"Surgeons in New York have performed the first-ever whole-eye transplant in a human, they announced on Thursday, an accomplishment being hailed as a breakthrough even though the patient has not regained sight in the eye.
In the six months since the surgery, performed during a partial face transplant, the grafted eye has shown important signs of health, including well-functioning blood vessels and a promising-looking retina, according to the surgical team at NYU Langone Health.
“The mere fact that we transplanted an eye is a huge step forward, something that for centuries has been thought about, but it’s never been performed,” said Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez, who led the team.
Until now, doctors have only been able to transplant the cornea, the clear front layer of the eye.
The recipient of the eye, Aaron James, is a 46-year-old military veteran from Arkansas who survived a work-related high-voltage electrical accident that destroyed the left side of his face, his nose, his mouth and his left eye.
The transplant surgery took 21 hours.
Initially, doctors were just planning to include the eyeball as part of the face transplant for cosmetic reasons, Rodriguez said during a Zoom interview.
“If some form of vision restoration occurred, it would be wonderful, but… the goal was for us to perform the technical operation,” and have the eyeball survive, Rodriquez added.
Whatever happens going forward will be monitored, he said.
Presently, the transplanted eye is not communicating with the brain through the optic nerve.
To encourage healing of the connection between the donor and recipient optic nerves, surgeons harvested adult stem cells from the donor’s bone marrow and injected them into the optic nerve during the transplant, hoping they would replace damaged cells and protect the nerve.
Transplantation of a viable eye globe opens many new possibilities, Rodriguez said, even if sight is not restored in this case.
Other research teams are developing ways to connect nerve networks in the brain to sightless eyes through insertion of electrodes, for example, to allow vision, he said.
“If we can work with other scientists that are working on other methods of restoring vision or restoring images to the visual cortex, I think we’re one step closer,” Rodriguez said.
James, who had retained vision in his right eye, knew he might not regain vision in the transplanted eye.
The doctors “never expected it to work at all, and they told me that from the get-go,” he said.
“I told them, ‘even if I can’t see… maybe at least you all can learn something to help the next person.’ That’s how you get started,” he said. “Hopefully this opens up a new path.”
James might still regain sight in the transplanted eye, Rodriguez said.
“I don’t think anyone can claim that he will see. But by the same token, they can’t claim that he will not see,” Rodriguez said. “At this point, I think we’re pretty happy with the result that we were able to achieve with a very technically demanding operation.”",Reuters,"Nov 10, 2023 10:15 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-ramps-up-pest-control-after-reports-bedbugs/,South Korea ramps up pest control after reports of bedbugs,"SEOUL, South Korea – South Korea is ramping up pest control measures and inspections to prevent a spread of bedbugs after reports of suspected infestations at some saunas and residential facilities, officials said on Wednesday, November 9.
The small, flat oval insects have caused a panic in France, where reports of outbreaks on trains and in cinemas have raised worries about the impact on tourism and the Paris Olympics, which start in less than a year. Britain too has seen a jump in enquiries about the pests.
In South Korea, about 30 cases of suspected infestations have been reported nationwide, including at a traditional Korean spa called “jjimjilbang” in Incheon, west of Seoul, and a college dorm in the southeastern city of Daegu, officials said.
The prime minister’s office on Tuesday launched a four-week campaign with inspections of public facilities and pest control measures.
“Public anxiety is inevitable as reports continue to come in,” Park Ku-yeon, first deputy chief of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, who heads the team in change of the campaign, told a meeting.
Park singled out small dorm rooms known as “gosiwon” and single-room households as most vulnerable, calling for support from district authorities.
The wingless insects hide in mattresses and bedding and feed on blood, typically biting at night.
South Korea’s hotel and tour industry is stepping up vigilance with distribution of repellent and training for staff.
Lotte Hotels and Resorts, a hospitality arm of Lotte Corp 004990.KS, said it had not found any infestations but issued guidelines to all branches and it plans to disinfect bedding, mattresses, carpets and sofas.
“We’re trying to take strong precautionary steps,” a Lotte Hotel official told Reuters.
Authorities in the capital, Seoul, said metro operators would disinfect trains more frequently and gradually replace fabric seats with plastic ones.

https://www.rappler.com/philippines/mindanao/breast-cancer-not-death-sentence-costly-battle/,"Breast cancer: Not necessarily a death sentence, but a costly battle","CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – The breast cancer journey is complex at all levels, spanning from diagnosis to how people respond to it, their capacity to afford treatment, the support system, the battle against mental health challenges, the palliative care, and continuing until the end of care.
Mercelita “Merci” Jandayan-Labial, a graduate school professor at the Capitol University (CU) in Cagayan de Oro, is a breast cancer survivor who spent more than P2 million to combat the disease.
The day she received her breast cancer diagnosis, a rollercoaster of emotions overwhelmed her. With unwavering faith, solid family support, and a wide network of friends, she faced breast cancer head-on.
But to her, cancer is just a word.
Merci told Rappler, “Breast cancer is not a sentence because it does not put a period to our being. It didn’t stop my being. It probably slowed down my life, but it didn’t put an end to it. It is just a word because cancer had only been part of my ongoing journey. How we make meaning of the word all depends on us. How we battle against cancer is our call.”
Merci received a diagnosis of breast cancer Stage 2B. Her mammogram results indicated a Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RADS) 5 malignancy, a highly suspicious type of cancer requiring immediate action – in her case, the removal of her breasts.
In search of a second opinion, Merci consulted another doctor, hoping that there might be some discrepancy and that her life could return to normal as she had hoped when she first heard the initial diagnosis.
Unfortunately, nothing changed. Clarity emerged as the doctor conducted a fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) to confirm whether it was cancerous before proceeding with breast surgery.
She said, “I held on to the hope that it would yield a negative result, but it showed I was positive of having ductal carcinoma. I had breast cancer!”
To make matters worse, her tumor was HER2 positive, independent, aggressive, and metastatic, requiring targeted therapy to slow or eliminate the growth of cancer cells in her lymph nodes.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the annual cost of cancer care in the Philippines is P35.3 billion.
In Merci’s case, the cost of the targeted therapy drug was astronomical. Merci had to raise P122,000 every 21 days for her 18 treatment cycles, amounting to P2.4 million for the entire treatment.
Her heart also needed to be strong enough to endure the potential side effects of the treatment.
In March 2015, Merci spent P145,000 on a mastectomy.
Following the surgery, she underwent the systemic chemotherapy protocol AC-TH, consisting of eight cycles, followed by 33 days of radiotherapy and, finally, targeted therapy infusion.
Throughout her treatment, Merci suffered hair loss, physical weakness during each cycle, and daily radiation, all while grappling with various mental health issues and the constant concern of raising the funds to complete her treatment.
With limited financial resources, Merci began crowdfunding to finance her treatment.
Fortunately, her family, relatives, friends, and professional network responded to her plea, and the pooled resources covered her treatment, which extended for over a year.
A portion of the financial aid came from various government agencies tasked with assisting Filipinos in need of medical treatment.
However, accessing financial aid from these public institutions involved extensive documentation and lengthy processes.
Regrettably, what these agencies could provide was largely insufficient to cover the entire treatment protocol for those without a network as extensive as Merci’s.
Eight years since her diagnosis, Merci has moved forward. She now owns a review center and remains an active speaker and presenter.
She is also a member of Thrive CDO, a breast cancer awareness advocacy group in Cagayan de Oro City.
It was different for Arki who didn’t make it.
Upon learning of her breast cancer diagnosis, she kept it a secret, sharing it with only a few close friends. Not even her children or husband were aware until she reached the metastatic stage in 2017.
Arki chose herbal supplements and adopted a healthier diet in the hope of returning to normal life. Her religious beliefs and financial capacity influenced her choices.
In early 2018, due to unbearable pain, Arki finally sought medical intervention. Sadly, one month later, she passed away.
Breast cancer remains the leading cause of death among women worldwide and in the Philippines, despite innovative treatment protocols being available.
It accounted for 685,000 or 15.5% of the total 4.4 million cancer deaths among females worldwide and 9,926 or 21.8% of the 45,560 cancer deaths in the Philippines in 2020.
Globally, among all cancer types, breast cancer had the highest incidence, with 2.3 million cases, making up 11.7% of the 19.3 million new cases, according to the WHO in 2020.
Over a five-year period, its prevalence reached 7.9 million or 15.4% of the total 50.5 million cases.
In a report released in May 2023, the Philippine Statistics Office (PSO) recorded 63,377 deaths, accounting for 10.2% of neoplasms or cancer-related diseases from January to December of the previous year.
Cancer ranked as the second leading cause of death in the country in 2022, following ischemic heart disease.
Dr. Wilfredo Liangco of Medical Center Manila said that in 2017, the country had the highest prevalence of breast cancer among 197 countries.
More than half, or 53%, of breast cancer cases in the country are diagnosed in Stages III and IV, while only 2%-3% of cases are diagnosed in Stage 1.
The survival rate in high-income countries is 90%, while in low-income countries, it ranges from 40% to 66%. The discrepancy reflects the differences in breast cancer awareness, screening practices, and the accessibility of innovative treatments between high-income and low-income countries.
When Merci and Arki were diagnosed with breast cancer, there was no cancer control law yet. It was only enacted as the National Integrated Cancer Control Act (RA 11215) in February 2019, during the administration of former president Rodrigo Duterte, with its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) coming out in August 2019.
The law has led to the opening of more cancer centers in public hospitals in the country and has established systematic financial support for cancer patients’ care.
Negotiating for the prices of targeted therapy drugs is also part of the cancer care programs.
Dr. Alfonso Nuñez III, interim executive director of the Philippine Cancer Center, said the law has introduced measures to support the financial needs of cancer patients in the country. This includes the establishment of a Cancer Assistance Fund (CAF) and a Cancer Supportive Care and Palliative Care Medicines Access Program (CSPMAP).
According to Dr. Nuñez, CSPMAP is a social protection initiative aimed at providing equitable access to the entire cancer care continuum for indigents, protecting them against financial hardship.
Through this program, patients can access a range of cancer medications, including chemotherapy drugs and other supportive medications, required during the course of cancer treatment.
CAF supports CSPMAP by covering diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for patients accessing cancer care for early detection, rapid diagnosis, treatment, and care.
While there are still barriers and gaps in the screening program, data collection, research, supportive and palliative care, and survivorship care for managing cancer, measures have been identified and employed to ease the burden of cancer treatment.
In terms of Cancer Care Centers, the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC) in Davao City is one of the 11 advanced comprehensive cancer specialty centers established in the country.
It primarily serves patients from the Davao region and other areas in Mindanao, being the only one of its kind in Mindanao.
Dr. Kenny Jun Demegillo, the training officer of the medical oncology section of SPMC, said the SPMC Cancer Institute offers sub-specialty training in medical, surgical, pediatric, and radiation oncology, as well as hospice and palliative care.
Among the 13 basic comprehensive cancer centers in the country, four are located in Mindanao. These are the following:
Northern Mindanao Medical Center in Cagayan de Oro CityDavao Regional Medical Center in Tagum City, Davao del NorteCotabato Regional Medical Center in Cotabato CityZamboanga Medical City Medical Center in Zamboanga City

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/first-dengue-pill-shows-promise-human-challenge-trial/,First pill for dengue shows promise in human challenge trial,"A pill for dengue fever developed by Johnson & Johnson appeared to protect against a form of the virus in a handful of patients in a small human challenge trial in the United States, according to data presented by the company on Friday.
There are currently no specific treatments for dengue, a growing disease threat, the company said ahead of presentation of the data at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Annual Meeting in Chicago.
“It is the first ever to show antiviral activity against dengue,” Marnix Van Loock, who oversees emerging pathogens research for J&J’s Janssen division, said of the drug.
In human challenge trials, researchers intentionally expose healthy volunteers to a pathogen to test a vaccine or treatment, or better understand the disease they cause.
Dengue fever, while often asymptomatic, is also known as “break bone fever” for the severity of the joint pain and spasms that some patients experience. It has long been a scourge across much of Asia and Latin America, causing millions of infections each year and tens of thousands of deaths, and is likely to spread further as climate change makes more areas hospitable for the mosquitoes that spread it, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist Jeremy Farrar said earlier this month.
In the trial done with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 10 volunteers were given a high dose of the J&J pill five days before being injected with a type of dengue. They continued to take the pill for 21 days afterwards.
Six of the 10 showed no detectable dengue virus in their blood after being exposed to the pathogen, as well as no signs that their immune system had responded to infection by the virus over 85 days of monitoring.
The five people in a placebo group, who were also injected with dengue, all showed detectable virus when tested. Trial participants received standard care from medical professionals where necessary, and the virus used was a weakened version to minimise symptoms.
The positive early data supports ongoing Phase II trials of the pill to prevent the four different types of dengue in a real world-setting where the disease is common, J&J said. The next step will be testing it as a treatment.
The drug works by blocking the action of two viral proteins, preventing the virus from making copies of itself. It was well-tolerated by all trial participants, J&J said.
A key question for the future will be ensuring access to the new drug, if it works on a larger scale, in many of the low- and middle-income countries where it is most needed, an echo of the challenge for the dengue vaccine the WHO backed earlier this month.

“Almost exactly two years ago, W.H.O. recommended the broad use of the world’s first malaria vaccine called RTS,S,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing in Geneva.
“Today, it gives me great pleasure to announce that WHO is recommending a second vaccine called R21/Matrix-M to prevent malaria in children at risk of the disease.”
R21/Matrix-M, developed by Britain’s University of Oxford, will be rolled out in some African countries in early 2024 and available mid-2024 in other countries, Tedros said, adding that doses would cost between $2 and $4.
“WHO is now reviewing the vaccine for prequalification, which is WHO stamp of approval, and will enable GAVI (a global vaccine alliance) and UNICEF to buy the vaccine from manufacturers,” Tedros said.
The R21/Matrix-M is mass manufactured by Serum Institute of India and uses Novavax’s Matrix M adjuvant.
Tedros added the agency had also recommended Takeda Pharmaceuticals’ 4502.T vaccine against dengue called Qdenga for children aged six to 16 years living in areas where the infection is a significant public health problem.
Dengue, common in tropical and subtropical climates, is a viral infection spread from mosquitoes to people.
Takeda’s vaccine was shown in trials to be effective against all 4 stereotypes of the virus in people who were previously infected by dengue, Hanna Nohynek, chair of WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, told journalists.
She added, however, that there remained uncertainty about its performance against stereotype 3 and 4 in people who have not been infected previously.
The WHO’s strategic advisory group also recommended a simplified single dose regime for primary immunization for most COVID-19 vaccines to improve acceptance of the shots at a time when most people have had at least one prior infection
The agency added that any monovalent or bivalent vaccine could be used given that monovalent vaccines that target the XBB.1.5 variant – the dominant variant in many places this year – are not available in many countries.",Reuters,"Oct 2, 2023 11:11 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/winners-nobel-prize-medicine-2023/,Hungarian and US scientists win Nobel for COVID-19 vaccine discoveries,"STOCKHOLM, Sweden – Hungarian scientist Katalin Kariko and US colleague Drew Weissman, who met in line for a photocopier before making mRNA molecule discoveries that paved the way for COVID-19 vaccines, won the 2023 Nobel Prize for Medicine on Monday, October 2.
“The laureates contributed to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times,” the Swedish award-giving body said in the latest accolade for the pair.
The prize, among the most prestigious in the scientific world, was selected by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden’s Karolinska Institute medical university and comes with 11 million Swedish crowns (about $1 million) to share between them.
Kariko, a former senior vice president and head of RNA protein replacement at German biotech firm BioNTech, is a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn).
“We are not working for any kind of reward,” Kariko, who struggled for years to find grants for her research, said in remarks alongside Weissman at UPenn’s Philadelphia campus, a few hours after she was awoken by the call from Stockholm. “The importance was to have a product which is helpful.”
Co-winner Weissman, a professor in vaccine research also at UPenn, said it was a “lifetime dream” to win and recalled working intensely with Kariko for more than 20 years, including middle-of-the-night emails as they both suffered disturbed sleep.
In 2005, Kariko and Weissman developed so-called nucleoside base modifications, which stop the immune system from launching an inflammatory attack against lab-made mRNA, previously seen as a major hurdle against any therapeutic use of the technology.
“We couldn’t get people to notice RNA as something interesting,” Weissman said on Monday. “Pretty much everybody gave up on it.”
Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries enabling the development of COVID-19 vaccines, the award-giving body said on Monday, October 2. #NobelPrizeREAD: https://t.co/eMSS70U36J pic.twitter.com/eKbkSGV3z1
BioNTech said in June that about 1.5 billion people across the world had received its mRNA shot, co-developed with Pfizer PFE.N. It was the most widely used shot in the West.
Having grown up in a village in a house without running water or a refrigerator, Kariko got a biochemistry doctorate in Szeged before she and her husband sold their Soviet-made Lada car, sewed some cash into their daughter’s teddy bear and went to the US on a one-way ticket.
The daughter, Susan Francia, became a US national rower and Olympic gold winner.
At UPenn, Kariko tried to turn mRNA into a treatment tool throughout the 1990s but struggled to win grants because work on DNA and gene therapy captured most of the scientific community’s attention at the time.
Kariko has said she endured ridicule from university colleagues for her dogged pursuit, and her failure to secure research grants led to UPenn demoting her from a full-time professor track in 1995.
Weissman received his doctorate from Boston University in 1987 and joined UPenn in 1997.
The two have said they met and began chatting in 1998 while waiting for rationed photocopying machine time.
“Maybe you have some more copy machines now,” Kariko said at UPenn on Monday. “I bragged about how I can do RNA, and Drew was interested in vaccines, and that is how our collaboration started.”
Sir Andrew Pollard, an immunology professor at Oxford University who pursued a different technology when co-developing the lesser-used COVID vaccine by AstraZeneca AZN.L, said it was “absolutely right that the ground-breaking work” done by Kariko and Weissman should be recognized by the Nobel committee.
The award comes even as Germany’s CureVac5CV.DE, which failed to bring a COVID shot to market, as well as rival Moderna, are separately suing BioNTech and Pfizer for alleged mRNA patent infringements.
BioNTech and Pfizer in turn have launched legal challenges against the validity of the intellectual property rights in question.
Messenger or mRNA, discovered in 1961, is a natural molecule that serves as a recipe for the body’s production of proteins. Use of lab-made mRNA to instruct human cells to make therapeutic proteins, long regarded as impossible, was commercially pioneered during the pandemic, also by Moderna MRNA.O.
Prospective mRNA uses include cancer therapies and vaccines against malaria, influenza and rabies.
The medicine prize kicks off this year’s Nobel awards with the remaining five to be unveiled in coming days.
The prizes, first handed out in 1901, were created by Swedish dynamite inventor and wealthy businessman Alfred Nobel.
Last year’s medicine prize went to Swede Svante Paabo for sequencing the genome of the Neanderthal and other past winners include Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 prize for the discovery of penicillin.
“If you don’t enjoy what you are doing then you shouldn’t do it,” Kariko said on Monday. “If you want to be rich, I don’t know the answer for that. But if you would like to solve problems, then science is for you.”",Reuters,"Oct 2, 2023 5:53 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/environment/filipino-chilean-scientists-findings-small-islands-invasive-species-require-research-policy-attention/,"Filipino, Chilean scientists: Small islands, invasive species need research, policy attention","LAGUNA, Philippines – Filipino and Chilean scientists recently advised governments and communities of the significance of safeguarding small islands and warned them against the aggressive rates of invasive alien species that contribute to biodiversity loss.
In a recently published article in the npj Biodiversity journal, Andrea Monica Ortiz, Laurice Jamero, Silvio Crespin, Cecilia Ramirez, Denise Matias, Jameela Joy Reyes, Anibal Pauchard, and Tony La Viña of the Ateneo School of Government highlighted the need to include small islands in research and policy attention.
Small islands are not only more vulnerable to climate change and biodiversity loss but they also play a vital role in the ecosystem and the stability of human life on Earth.
While the Small Islands Developing States (SIDS), a political group of 39 states and 18 associate members of the United Nations regional commissions, have uplifted the case of small islands in the global policy sphere, it is still limited to those part of the assemblage.
The Philippines and Chile, for instance, are not part of SIDS. Hence, the support and focus on environmental policies are not often extended to non-SIDS countries or states.
“We appeal to the scientific and policy community to consider ‘SIDS and other archipelagos,’ which share many common problems,” Ortiz said.
They argued that the current Global Biodiversity Framework, which indicates that 30% of the earth should be protected by 2030, does not include urgency in protecting the biodiversity and resilience of small islands.
Similarly, the archipelagic state of the Philippines did not reflect the small islands’ proper management and protection allocation in its national agenda.
“Although they [islands] may seem remote or isolated…[they are] much stronger together. We need connected, archipelagic solutions for archipelagic challenges,” Ortiz said.
The Philippines is considered a biodiversity hotspot, which means that while most of its species are endemic (cannot be found elsewhere) to the country and diverse, they are highly threatened by destruction and habitat loss.
Classifying a country or region as a biodiversity hotspot means that it has lost at least 70% of its original natural vegetation. These hotspots require strict conservation measures, especially since they house almost half of the world’s plants in less than 3% of Earth’s land surface.
“Many islands in both the Philippines and Chile are already severely affected by biodiversity problems like invasive species and sea-level rise. However, because they are far and/or remote to access, they are also unfortunately ‘far and remote’ from the national agenda,” Ortiz added, citing the similarities between the two countries.
Among the challenges affecting small islands’ health and biodiversity is the rampant increase in the introduction of invasive alien species – may it be intentional or unintentional.
Invasive alien species are organisms (plants or animals) not indigenous or native to a particular location. While some of them may be aesthetically pleasing, their ability to spread and adapt quickly to an environment may harm native species and result in biodiversity loss.
The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report provided a thematic assessment of invasive alien species in relation to sustaining healthy biodiversity and functioning ecosystem services.
Pauchard, one of the authors of the said report who is also a co-chair of the IPBES and a co-author of the npj Biodiversity article on small islands, said that their assessment found invasive alien species as a major threat not only to biodiversity but also to people worldwide.
The water hyacinth, more fondly called the water lily in the Philippines, is a popular freshwater ornamental garden pond plant yet a notorious invasive species. Because it can easily cover 600 square meters in just a year and reduce the water’s oxygen level, it can kill the aquatic biodiversity in the area. It reduces the ability of life underwater and on the surface water to acquire its essential nutrients, making it detrimental to the economy and human life as well.
“People need to be aware of the problem of invasive alien species, and personal actions are relevant; for example…avoiding owning and releasing pets that may be [at] high risk of becoming invasive. Also, ornamental plants are a potential source of invasive plants,” Pauchard said, highlighting the need to certify the sources of plants and seeds that people buy.
Pauchard said that climate change may also worsen the impacts of invasive species, considering that they often destroy the naturally occurring species that are supposed to strengthen and stabilize the environment’s resilience to stresses.
The Philippines’ Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act or Republic Act No. 9147 was enacted to protect the country’s biodiversity from unapproved exotic species. Since it does not specifically cite invasive species, there have been calls to update this 22-year-old law.
The impacts of climate change on invasive species, specifically on small islands, are just the tip of the iceberg in the discussion of environmental sustainability and climate change. Its contribution to significant biodiversity loss limits humans’ survival in the changing world.
“We urge the scientific and policy community to better recognize the challenges faced by islands globally and locally and make them a priority in research, planning, and development. Their resilience is the country’s and planet’s resilience,” Ortiz said.",Arby Paulyn Rae Duero,"Sep 27, 2023 4:42 PM PHT"

Speaking at the Cantor Fitzgerald Annual Healthcare Conference, chief executive officer Albert Bourla said the company is still uncertain about when Paxlovid, which is currently being distributed by the government, will receive approval to be sold in the US commercial market.
Paxlovid, taken for five days beginning shortly after onset of symptoms, is used to treat adults at high risk of hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19.
Bourla, however, said Pfizer is ready to supply its COVID-19 vaccines with a smooth transition to the commercial market.
“There is enough product that has been already manufactured and we keep manufacturing,” Bourla said. “We are very confident that the market will be very well supplied.”
In the first week after updated COVID-19 vaccines became available in the US, there have been hiccups with its rollout as people have reported being turned away from pharmacies for the shots.
Pfizer has sold nearly 24 million courses of Paxlovid to the US government, which has distributed only about 15 million courses so far, according to US Department of Health and Human Services data.
According to IQVIA data published by research analysts, the oral antiviral COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid hit around 217,000 prescriptions in the US in the week of September 1, but has dropped since then.",Reuters,"Sep 27, 2023 10:37 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/nipah-virus-what-we-know/,What is the Nipah virus that killed 2 in India and how is it treated?,"NEW DELHI, India – India’s southern state of Kerala shut some schools and offices this week as officials raced to halt the spread of the deadly Nipah virus, after it killed two people in the fourth outbreak since 2018.
Here is what we know about the virus:
The Nipah virus was first identified in 1998 during an outbreak of illness among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore.
It is able to infect humans directly through contact with the bodily fluids of infected bats and pigs, with some documented cases of transmission among humans.
Scientists suspect Nipah has existed among flying foxes for millennia and fear a mutated, highly transmissible strain will emerge from bats.
There are no vaccines to prevent or cure the infection, which has a mortality rate of between about 70%. The usual treatment is to provide supportive care.
Infected people initially develop symptoms that include fever, respiratory distress, headaches, and vomiting, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Encephalitis and seizures can also occur in severe cases, leading to a coma.
The virus is on the WHO’s research and development list of pathogens with epidemic potential.
The 1998 outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore killed more than 100 people and infected nearly 300. Since then, it has spread thousands of miles, killing between 72% and 86% of those infected.
More than 600 cases of Nipah virus human infections were reported between 1998 to 2015, WHO data shows.
A 2001 outbreak in India and two more in Bangladesh killed 62 of 91 people infected.
In 2018, an outbreak in Kerala claimed 21 lives, with other outbreaks in 2019 and 2021.

https://www.rappler.com/environment/climate-change-impeding-fight-against-aids-tb-malaria/,"Climate change impeding fight against AIDS, TB, and malaria","LONDON, United Kingdom – Climate change and conflict are hitting efforts to tackle three of the world’s deadliest infectious diseases, the head of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has warned.
International initiatives to fight the diseases have largely recovered after being badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Fund’s 2023 results report released on Monday, September 18.
But the increasing challenges of climate change and conflict mean the world is likely to miss the target of putting an end to AIDS, TB and malaria by 2030 without “extraordinary steps,” said Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund.
For example, malaria is spreading to highland parts of Africa that were previously too cold for the mosquito carrying the disease-causing parasite.
Extreme weather events like floods are overwhelming health services, displacing communities, causing upsurges in infection and interrupting treatment in many different places, the report said. In countries including Sudan, Ukraine, Afghanistan and Myanmar, simply reaching vulnerable communities has also been immensely challenging due to insecurity, it added.
There are positives, Sands said. For example, in 2022, 6.7 million people were treated for TB in the countries where the Global Fund invests, 1.4 million more people than in the previous year. The Fund also helped provide 24.5 million people with antiretroviral therapy for HIV, and distributed 220 million mosquito nets.
Sands added that innovative prevention and diagnostic tools also provided hope.
This week, there is a high-level meeting on TB at the UN General Assembly, and advocates hope for more of a focus on the disease.
The Global Fund has faced criticism from some TB experts for not allocating more of its budget to the disease, as it is the biggest killer of the three diseases the fund focuses on.
“There’s no doubt that the world needs to devote more resources towards fighting TB… but it is not as simple as comparing annual deaths from each disease,” said Sands. For example, he said, many countries with the highest burden of TB are middle-income countries that have more capacity to fund health services domestically.",Reuters,"Sep 18, 2023 10:17 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/philippines/clinical-geneticist-carmencita-padilla-national-scientist/,Clinical geneticist Carmencita Padilla is 43rd National Scientist,"MANILA, Philippines – Pioneer clinical geneticist Carmencita Padilla became the latest member of the illustrious Order of National Scientists after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. conferred on her the award Thursday, August 31, in a ceremony at the Malacañang Palace.
In bestowing the honor, the President underscored the importance of research and development and the government’s support in these areas.
The Order of National Scientist is the highest recognition given to persons of science conferred by the Philippine president in accordance to Executive Order No. 236 of 2003. The award is of equal rank to the likewise eminent Order of the National Artist. Annually, the president selects from the scientists nominated by the National Academy of Science and Technology.
Padilla is the 43rd and only living female National Scientist from the health sciences.
Her expertise on clinical genetics and research on newborn screening became the basis of Republic Act No. 9288 or the Newborn Screening Act of 2004.
The law set up the country’s newborn screening services, which  are administered after 24 hours of life. The screening helps detect health risks in newborns that may lead, if untreated, to mental retardation or even death.
Padilla helped establish the Philippine Genome Center, a multidisciplinary research unit that offers DNA sequencing services. She served as its executive director from 2011 to 2016.
The center was critical during the COVID-19 pandemic when it handled the sequencing of coronavirus samples to aid experts with knowledge on how to mitigate the spread of the disease.
She is currently the chancellor of the University of the Philippines Manila, the country’s health sciences center that offers programs on training, research, and development in the medical field. It is in the same university where Padilla obtained her doctorate degree in medicine and eventually her master’s degree in health policy studies.
Aside from the rank and title, awardees are also given annual gratuity and other privileges.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/australian-scientists-first-world-discovery-parasitic-worm-human-brain/,Australian scientists make world-first discovery of parasitic worm in woman’s brain,"SYDNEY, Australia  – An Australian scientist detailed on Tuesday, August 29, a world-first discovery after an 8-centimeter (3-inch) -long parasitic worm was found in the brain of a woman in Canberra, spotlighting the risks of infectious organisms jumping between species.
Identified by scientists as a roundworm most commonly seen in carpet pythons, it was discovered last year in a 64-year-old undergoing surgery in the Australian capital, following complaints of abdominal pain, forgetfulness, and depression.
A study of the case published on Monday, August 28, in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases suggested she may have been exposed through foraging for wild grasses that could have been contaminated with python faeces.
“When you operate on someone’s brain and you take a biopsy of something, you never expect to encounter something living,” Dr. Sanjaya Senanayake, one of the study’s authors, told Reuters.
While scientists are familiar with parasites in humans, a worm so large had never before been seen in a human, he added.
“(It) was certainly something we’ll never forget.”
The woman, whom Senanayake praised as being “very courageous” returned to normal life after her discharge from hospital, but is still being monitored by doctors.
“Because this was an unusual case at so many levels, we’re keeping a close eye on her and keeping in touch,” Senanayake said.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/new-lineage-covid-19-august-17-2023/,US CDC tracks new lineage of virus that causes COVID-19,"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday, August 17, that it was tracking a new, highly mutated lineage of the virus that causes COVID-19.
The lineage is named BA.2.86, and has been detected in the United States, Denmark, and Israel, the CDC said in a post on messaging platform X.
“As we learn more about BA.2.86, CDC’s advice on protecting yourself from COVID-19 remains the same,” the agency said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier on Thursday said in a post on X that it had classified BA.2.86 as a “variant under monitoring” due to the large number of mutations it carries.
The WHO said that, so far, only a few sequences of the variant have been reported from a handful of countries.
The new lineage, which has 36 mutations from the currently-dominant XBB.1.5 COVID variant “harkens back to an earlier branch” of the virus, explained Dr. S. Wesley Long, medical director of diagnostic microbiology at Houston Methodist.
He said it remains to be seen whether BA.2.86 will be able to out-compete other strains of the virus or have any advantage in escaping immune responses from prior infection or vaccination.
Early analysis indicates that the new variant “will have equal or greater escape than XBB.1.5 from antibodies elicited by pre-Omicron and first-generation Omicron variants,” Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center said in a slide deck published on Thursday, August 17.
The Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 is the strain targeted by vaccines in upcoming COVID booster shots.
Bloom’s slides note that the most likely scenario is that BA.2.86 is less transmissible than current dominant variants, so never spreads widely, but more sequencing data is needed.
“My biggest concern would be that it could cause a bigger spike in cases than what we have seen in recent waves,” Dr. Long said. “The boosters will still help you fight off COVID in general.”",Reuters,"Aug 18, 2023 1:27 PM PHT"

The fast-spreading variant, the most prevalent in the United States with an estimated more than 17% of cases, has been behind upticks in the virus across the country and also has been detected in China, South Korea, Japan and Canada, among other countries.
“Collectively, available evidence does not suggest that EG.5 has additional public health risks relative to the other currently circulating Omicron descendent lineages,” the WHO said in a risk evaluation.
A more comprehensive evaluation of the risk posed by EG.5 was needed, it added.
COVID-19 has killed more than 6.9 million people globally, with more than 768 million confirmed cases since the virus emerged. WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic in March 2020 and ended the global emergency status for COVID-19 in May this year.
Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on COVID-19, said EG.5 had an increased transmissibility but was not more severe than other Omicron variants.
“We don’t detect a change in severity of EG.5 compared to other sublineages of Omicron that have been in circulation since late 2021,” she said.
Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus deplored that many countries were not reporting COVID-19 data to WHO.
He said that only 11% had reported hospitalizations and ICU admissions related to the virus.
In response, WHO issued a set of standing recommendations for COVID, in which it urged countries to continue reporting COVID data, particularly mortality data, morbidity data, and to continue to offer vaccination.
Van Kerkhove said that the absence of data from many countries was hindering efforts to fight the virus.
“About a year ago, we were in a much better situation to either anticipate or act or be more agile,” she said. “And now the delay in our ability to do that is growing. And our ability to do this is declining.”",Reuters,"Aug 9, 2023 11:27 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/spanish-researchers-aim-trick-nature-artificial-womb/,Spanish researchers aim to ‘trick nature’ with artificial womb,"BARCELONA, Spain – Researchers in Barcelona are trying to “trick nature” by creating an artificial womb for extremely premature babies after tests on animals kept foetuses alive for 12 days.
Their artificial placenta prototype recreates a protective environment with a translucent container made of biocompatible material inside which the fetus’ lungs, intestines and brain can continue to develop.
It is connected to an amniotic fluid circulation system that maintains the fetus isolated from external stimuli but accessible for ultrasound controls and monitoring.
Babies born after six months of pregnancy or less are considered extremely premature with a high risk of death or disability. The World Health Organization’s latest figures show that around 900,000 such babies died worldwide in 2019.
“We try to develop a system that allows us to keep a fetus outside its mother but still in the fetal conditions: that it continues to breathe through the umbilical cord … that we can feed it through the umbilical cord, that it lives surrounded by fluid at a constant temperature,” project head Eduard Gratacos told Reuters.
He leads a team of 35 from BCNatal medical research center – a fusion of the maternal-fetal medicine and obstetrics departments of two Barcelona hospitals – and Fundacion La Caixa, a private organization funded by Caixabank CABK.MC.
The team has conducted pre-clinical studies with lambs, where they achieved 12-day fetus survival, and plans to also test with pigs before proposing a human trial in a few years.
“The highly-complex project spans many different specialties of medicine and requires engineers of different types. It’s a challenge, it’s extremely delicate to achieve this, to trick nature to make this possible,” Gratacos said.
Among a few such projects worldwide, one group of scientists at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia managed to keep animal fetuses alive for 28 days.
Kelly Werner, assistant professor of paediatrics at Columbia University, told the Science Media Center the Spanish team’s positive results must be rigorously tested in clinical trials on humans to check for safety and side effects.
“Although it is an exciting development, the artificial placenta is not intended to replace a natural placenta,” Werner said. “That is, despite these advancements, we still should make every effort to support maternal health and decrease risk factors that lead to preterm birth.”",Reuters,"Jul 1, 2023 5:24 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/things-to-know-aspartame-world-health-organization-rulings-cancer-consumption/,EXPLAINER: What is aspartame and what do the new WHO rulings on cancer and consumption mean?,"Aspartame, a popular artificial sweetener found in Diet Coke, chewing gum, yoghurt and other food products, is a “possible carcinogen” but it remains safe to consume at the existing daily intake guidelines, according to new rulings from two different World Health Organization-linked groups.
Discovered in 1965 by American chemist James Schlatter, aspartame is about 200 times sweeter than the regular table sugar. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1974 for use as a tabletop sweetener and as an additive in chewing gum, breakfast cereals, and dry bases for foods.
One group of experts, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), said aspartame is a “possible carcinogen.” That means there is limited evidence showing a potential cancer link and puts it in the same classification group as aloe vera extract and some Asian pickled vegetables.
Another expert panel, the WHO/FAO Joint Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), also reviewed aspartame and maintained its advice that it remains safe to consume within current recommended daily limits. For aspartame, this limit is 40 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight per day.
That means an adult weighing 70 kg (approximately 150 pounds) would need to consume between 9 and 14 cans of diet soft drink in one day to surpass the limit.
There has been some confusion around the rulings, but the agencies say they are “complementary”. The two groups work differently, and have a different aim: while IARC flags a potential hazard based on even limited evidence, JECFA assesses the real-life risk.
Gunter Kuhnle, professor of nutrition at the United Kingdom’s University of Reading, said it highlighted the difference between hazard and risk.
“Sunlight is a hazard as it can cause cancer, but the risk depends on the amount of sunlight and whether we use protection. Likewise, even if aspartame causes cancer at very high amounts, there is no risk when consuming it at the amounts that are permitted in foods,” he said.
Because aspartame is very sweet, much less is needed in products to create the same taste as sugar, so it has a calorific value of almost zero. It also does not have the bitter aftertaste of saccharin, another sweetener. Aspartame grew in popularity as a more diet-conscious consumer emerged in the 1980s.
The low-calorie sugar substitute can be found in soft drinks, gelatin, confectionery, desserts, and sugar-free cough drops. It is also used to enhance flavoring of baked and canned foods, powdered drink mixes, candy, and puddings.
Here is a list of popular items that contain aspartame:
Aspartame’s use in food products has been debated for decades and has also prompted some companies to remove the compound from their products.
PepsiCo removed aspartame from some US diet sodas. Although the company brought it back a year later, it again removed the ingredient in 2020.
General Mills’ Yoplait also removed aspartame from its yogurts in 2014. The brand’s low-sugar products now contain alternative sweeteners like sucralose.
Saccharin, sucralose and neotame are among five other artificial sweeteners alongside aspartame authorized by a WHO expert committee on food additives.
The FDA has also approved usage of three types of plant- and fruit-based sweeteners, including extracts obtained from the stevia plant, swingle fruit extracts and a group of proteins called Thaumatin.
More than 90 countries, including the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Italy, Denmark, Germany, Australia and New Zealand have reviewed aspartame and found it to be safe for human consumption and allow its use.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/world-health-organization-cancer-research-agency-aspartame-possible-carcinogen/,WHO’s cancer research agency to say aspartame sweetener a possible carcinogen – sources,"LONDON, United Kingdom – One of the world’s most common artificial sweeteners is set to be declared a possible carcinogen in July by a leading global health body, according to two sources with knowledge of the process, pitting it against the food industry and regulators.
Aspartame, used in products from Coca-Cola diet sodas to Mars’ Extra chewing gum and some Snapple drinks, will be listed in July as “possibly carcinogenic to humans” for the first time by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the World Health Organization’s (WHO) cancer research arm, the sources said.
The IARC ruling, finalized earlier this month after a meeting of the group’s external experts, is intended to assess whether something is a potential hazard or not, based on all the published evidence.
It does not take into account how much of a product a person can safely consume. This advice for individuals comes from a separate WHO expert committee on food additives, known as JECFA (the Joint WHO and Food and Agriculture Organization’s Expert Committee on Food Additives), alongside determinations from national regulators.
However, similar IARC rulings in the past for different substances have raised concerns among consumers about their use, led to lawsuits, and pressured manufacturers to recreate recipes and swap to alternatives. That has led to criticism that the IARC’s assessments can be confusing to the public.
JECFA, the WHO committee on additives, is also reviewing aspartame use this year. Its meeting began at the end of June and it is due to announce its findings on the same day that the IARC makes public its decision – on July 14.
Since 1981, JECFA has said aspartame is safe to consume within accepted daily limits. For example, an adult weighing 60 kg (132 pounds) would have to drink between 12 and 36 cans of diet soda – depending on the amount of aspartame in the beverage – every day to be at risk. Its view has been widely shared by national regulators, including in the United States and Europe.
An IARC spokesperson said both the IARC and JECFA committees’ findings were confidential until July, but added they were “complementary,” with IARC’s conclusion representing “the first fundamental step to understand carcinogenicity.” The additives committee “conducts risk assessment, which determines the probability of a specific type of harm (e.g., cancer) to occur under certain conditions and levels of exposure.”
However, industry and regulators fear that holding both processes at around the same time could be confusing, according to letters from US and Japanese regulators seen by Reuters.
“We kindly ask both bodies to coordinate their efforts in reviewing aspartame to avoid any confusion or concerns among the public,” Nozomi Tomita, an official from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, wrote in a letter dated March 27 to WHO’s deputy director general, Zsuzsanna Jakab.
The letter, reviewed by Reuters, also called for the conclusions of both bodies to be released on the same day, as is now happening. The Japanese mission in Geneva, where the WHO is based, did not respond to a request for comment.
The IARC’s rulings can have huge impact. In 2015, its committee concluded that glyphosate is “probably carcinogenic.” Years later, even as other bodies like the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) contested this assessment, companies were still feeling the effects of the decision. Germany’s Bayer in 2021 lost its third appeal against U.S. court verdicts that awarded damages to customers blaming their cancers on use of its glyphosate-based weedkillers.
The IARC’s decisions have also faced criticism for sparking needless alarm over hard to avoid substances or situations. It has previously put working overnight and consuming red meat into its “probably cancer-causing” class, and using mobile phones as “possibly cancer-causing,” similar to aspartame.
“IARC is not a food safety body and their review of aspartame is not scientifically comprehensive and is based heavily on widely discredited research,” Frances Hunt-Wood, the secretary general of the International Sweeteners Association (ISA), said.
The body, whose members include Mars Wrigley, a Coca-Cola unit and Cargill, said it had “serious concerns with the IARC review, which may mislead consumers.”
Aspartame has been extensively studied for years. Last year, an observational study in France among 100,000 adults showed that people who consumed larger amounts of artificial sweeteners – including aspartame – had a slightly higher cancer risk.
It followed a study from the Ramazzini Institute in Italy in the early 2000s, which reported that some cancers in mice and rats were linked to aspartame.
However, the first study could not prove that aspartame caused the increased cancer risk, and questions have been raised about the methodology of the second study, including by EFSA, which assessed it.
Aspartame is authorized for use globally by regulators who have reviewed all the available evidence, and major food and beverage makers have for decades defended their use of the ingredient. The IARC said it had assessed 1,300 studies in its June review.
Recent recipe tweaks by soft drinks giant Pepsico demonstrate the struggle the industry has when it comes to balancing taste preferences with health concerns. Pepsico removed aspartame from sodas in 2015, bringing it back a year later, only to remove it again in 2020.
Listing aspartame as a possible carcinogen is intended to motivate more research, said the sources close to the IARC, which will help agencies, consumers and manufacturers draw firmer conclusions.
But it will also likely ignite debate once again over the IARC’s role, as well as the safety of sweeteners more generally.
Last month, the WHO published guidelines advising consumers not to use non-sugar sweeteners for weight control. The guidelines caused a furor in the food industry, which argues they can be helpful for consumers wanting to reduce the amount of sugar in their diet. – Rappler.comes

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/scientists-isolate-human-gene-protect-against-most-bird-flu-viruses/,Scientists isolate human gene able to fend off most bird flu viruses,"LONDON, United Kingdom – UK researchers have homed in on a human gene implicated in thwarting most bird flu viruses from infecting people.
Bird flu chiefly spreads among wild birds such as ducks and gulls and can also infect farmed birds and domestic poultry such as chickens, turkeys, and quails.
Although the viruses largely affect birds, they can spill into bird predators, and in rare cases, humans typically in close contact with infected birds.
A team of scientists from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research studied hundreds of genes normally expressed by human cells, comparing the genes’ behavior during infection with either human seasonal viruses or avian flu viruses.
They zeroed in on a gene called BTN3A3, expressed both in the upper and the lower human respiratory tract. Nicknamed B-force by the researchers, the gene was found to block the replication of most strains of bird flu in human cells.
However, the gene’s antiviral activity failed to protect against seasonal human flu viruses.
This gene is part of a broader defensive apparatus in the human immune arsenal against bird viruses.
All the human influenza pandemics, including the 1918-19 global flu pandemic, were caused by influenza viruses that were resistant to BTN3A3, and therefore the gene appears to be a key factor in whether any bird flu strain has human pandemic potential, the researchers said.
To be sure, viruses mutate all the time, and this does not mean that bird flu viruses could not evolve to escape the activity of BTN3A3.
Earlier this year, a new H5NI strain of bird flu that transmits easily among wild birds explosively spread into new corners of the globe, infecting and killing a variety of mammal species and raising fears of a human pandemic. So far, only a handful of human cases have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO).
About 50% of H5N1 strains circulating globally so far in 2023 are resistant to BTN3A3, said professor Massimo Palmarini, the corresponding author of the study published in the science journal Nature.
“This is the sort of thing which we should be paying particular attention to as an elevated level of risk,” added Sam Wilson, a co-senior author of the study.",Reuters,"Jun 29, 2023 11:12 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/extreme-heat-disproportionately-impacts-people-with-disabilities/,Extreme heat ‘disproportionately’ impacts people with disabilities – report,"People with disabilities in Spain and other European countries have been disproportionately affected by unprecedented heat extremes, a leading human rights watchdog said on Monday, June 26, urging authorities to provide adequate support.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report that people with disabilities faced risk of death, physical, social, and mental health distress due to extreme heat particularly if “left to cope with dangerous temperatures on their own.”
Some people with disabilities are more likely to have health conditions or use medication that can affect the body’s ability to respond to heat. Having to stay home due to the heat can also lead to social isolation, HRW said.
Jonas Bull, assistant disability rights researcher at HRW, told Reuters that inaccessible urban spaces exacerbated the problem. Bull said his research focused on Spain but can be applied to other nations in Europe, which according to scientists is the fastest warming continent on the planet.
The report said lack of representation in the process of developing heatwave emergency plans meant the voices of people with disabilities were often not heard and their needs not included.
In Spain, one of the European nations that experienced record-breaking heatwaves last summer, the national plan to address the impacts of climate change lists actions to protect “vulnerable” populations but it does not propose any specific measures for people with disabilities, HRW said.
HRW interviewed 33 people with disabilities in the Spanish region of Andalusia and all said “they felt neglected” during heatwaves.
Bull recently presented the report to authorities in Andalusia and said they were committed to prioritise the issue in the future.
Heatwaves led to some 16,000 excess deaths last year in Europe but some countries, including Spain, do not break down data to show how people with disabilities are affected.
HRW said data was crucial to be able to implement targeted measures, as was bringing people with disabilities to the table when putting together climate plans.",Reuters,"Jun 26, 2023 2:44 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/alarming-rise-diabetes-globally-2050-study/,‘Alarming’ rise in diabetes globally by 2050 – study,"LONDON, United Kingdom – Every country in the world will see rates of diabetes rise in the next 30 years without action, according to a new global study.
There are currently 529 million people in the world with diabetes, the study led by researchers at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington found. They projected that this will more than double to around 1.3 billion people by 2050.
The majority of the cases are type 2 diabetes, the form of the disease that is linked to obesity and largely preventable, the researchers said.
The increase in prevalence globally is not uniform: Some countries and regions are particularly badly hit. For example, prevalence rates are expected to reach 16.8% in North Africa and the Middle East and 11.3% in Latin America and the Caribbean by 2050, compared to an estimated 9.8% globally. Currently, the prevalence is 6.1%. But every country will be impacted, researchers said.
“The rapid rate at which diabetes is growing is not only alarming but also challenging for every health system in the world,” said Liane Ong, lead author of the paper, pointing out that the condition is linked to a number of other heart conditions such as heart disease and stroke.
The growing numbers of people with diabetes is in part driven by rising obesity, and in part by demographic shifts: Prevalence is higher among older adults, the study showed. The data from 204 countries does not take into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic because those numbers were not yet available, researchers said.
The study, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is part of a wider series on diabetes published on Thursday in The Lancet medical journal. The series calls for more effective mitigation strategies and an awareness of inequality, with the majority of diabetes patients living in low- and middle-income countries and unable to access proper treatment.",Reuters,"Jun 23, 2023 10:25 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/fda-advisers-back-updated-covid-19-vaccine-targeting-xbb-variant/,FDA advisers back updated COVID-19 vaccine targeting dominant variant,"Advisers to the United States Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, June 15, unanimously recommended that updated COVID-19 shots being developed for a fall vaccination campaign target one of the currently dominant XBB coronavirus variants.
The panel voted 21-0 in favor of XBB-targeted shots, and the committee’s discussion indicated that the XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant would be preferred.
FDA official Dr. Peter Marks indicated the agency was likely to settle on XBB.1.5, which manufacturers suggested could be ready for inoculations soonest.
COVID-19 vaccine makers Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax, are already developing versions of their respective vaccines targeting XBB.1.5 and other currently circulating subvariants. Preclinical data from all three was presented at the meeting.
“It seems like it’s the most feasible to get across the finish line early without resulting in delays in availability,” Melinda Wharton, vaccine policy official at US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said of a shot aimed at XBB.1.5.
If XBB.1.5 is chosen as the target for this year’s campaign, it would be especially helpful to Novavax, as their protein-based vaccine takes longer to manufacture than rival mRNA-based shots. If the FDA chose a different target, Novavax could again find itself playing catch up to rivals.
“The fact that most of the manufacturers are ready to work on XBB.1.5 is an added reason to select this strain or this variant given the immunologic data,” said meeting chair Dr. Arnold Monto.
After the meeting, Novavax issued a release saying it expects to be able to deliver its XBB-targeted COVID-19 shot this fall.
FDA staff reviewers in documents released this week said available evidence suggests this year’s shots should target an XBB subvariant. XBB and its offshoots, which now account for most US infections, are descendants of the Omicron variant that caused COVID-19 cases to surge to record levels early last year.
US health regulators are looking to bring the next COVID-19 shots more closely in line with the circulating virus.
Pfizer, in its presentation, said it could supply its monovalent shots targeting the XBB.1.5 subvariant by the end of July, while Moderna said it was prepared to supply a new variant-containing shot for fall season.
A so-called monovalent, or single target, vaccine would be a change from the most recent bivalent COVID-19 boosters that targeted both the original strain of the coronavirus and Omicron.
The FDA takes recommendations from its outside experts into consideration before making a final decision on composition of the shots.
Thursday’s proceedings comes after an advisory group to the World Health Organization (WHO) last month recommended the next wave of COVID-19 booster shots be updated to target XBB subvariants. Europe’s medicine regulators have also backed that recommendation.
The CDC recommended booster shots broadly last year. But panel member Dr. Paul Offit questioned whether the shots needed to be recommended for “everybody every season,” noting that the highest risk groups are those most likely to benefit from an annual booster.
Only about 17% of the U.S. population – some 56.5 million people – received a COVID-19 booster during the 2022-2023 vaccination season, according to government data through early May. Older Americans were boosted at a higher rate than the general population.
Between Moderna and Pfizer, Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen expects 75 million doses to be sold in the United States during the 2023-2024 campaign.
Moderna last month said it continues to expect the US annual COVID-19 market to be 100 million doses, largely in line with Pfizer’s view of 102 million.

https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/biontech-faces-first-german-lawsuit-alleged-covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/,BioNTech faces first German lawsuit over alleged COVID-19 vaccine side effects,"HAMBURG, Germany – BioNTech will go to court on Monday, June 12, to defend itself against a lawsuit from a German woman who is seeking damages for alleged side effects of its COVID-19 vaccine, the first of potentially hundreds of cases in the country.
The woman, exercising her right under German privacy law for her name not to be made public, is suing the German vaccine maker for at least 150,000 euro ($161,500) in damages for bodily harm as well as compensation for unspecified material damage, according to the regional court in Hamburg which is hearing the case and law firm Rogert & Ulbrich, which is representing her.
The plaintiff claims she suffered upper-body pain, swollen extremities, fatigue, and a sleeping disorder due to the vaccine.
The first hearing is on Monday.
Tobias Ulbrich, a lawyer at Rogert & Ulbrich, told Reuters he aimed to challenge in court the assessment made by European Union regulators and German vaccine assessment bodies that the BioNTech shot has a positive risk-benefit profile.
German pharmaceutical law states that makers of drugs or vaccines are only liable to pay damages for side-effects if “medical science” shows that their products cause disproportionate harm relative to their benefits or if the label information is wrong.
BioNTech, which holds the marketing authorisation in Germany for the shot it developed with Pfizer, said it concluded after careful consideration that the case was without merit.
“The positive benefit-risk profile of Comirnaty remains positive and the safety profile has been well characterised,” the biotech firm said, referring to the vaccine’s brand name.
It noted about 1.5 billion people had received the shot across the world, including more than 64 million in Germany.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) says that BioNTech’s Comirnaty, the most commonly used in the Western world, is safe to use.
In a media briefing last week, the EMA reaffirmed the benefit of all COVID shots it approved, including BioNTech’s, saying in the first year of the pandemic alone, vaccines were estimated to have helped save almost 20 million lives globally.
It has said there is a very small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, two types of heart inflammation, following vaccination with Comirnaty, mainly for young males.
Unexpected side-effects after a drug has regulatory approval are rare. The unprecedented speed at which COVID vaccines were developed during the pandemic meant that potential uncommon side-effects may not have been detected as readily as they might have been in traditionally longer trials.
EMA has said that safety monitoring had not been compromised during the fast-track assessment.
The EMA had registered almost 1.7 million spontaneous reports of suspected side-effects by May, which translates into about 0.2 for every 100 administered doses.
Almost 768 million vaccine doses have been administered in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
The most common temporary side-effects are headache, fever, fatigue and muscle pain.
The EMA also monitors adverse events or illness after vaccination, and checks for frequencies that surpass normal rates in the non-vaccinated population.
It is not clear who would pay the legal costs or compensation if the plaintiff wins the case.
Sources have said some of the EU’s bulk purchase agreements with vaccine makers, including BioNTech-Pfizer, contained full or partial liability waivers for both legal costs and potential compensation, which could force EU governments to bear some of the costs.
Like many countries, Germany also has a public sector financial support scheme for people who suffer permanent harm from vaccines, known as a no-fault compensation programme, but participation in the programme does not block someone seeking damages separately.
The United States has granted manufacturers immunity from liability for COVID vaccines that receive regulatory approval.
Rogert & Ulbrich says it has filed about 250 cases for clients seeking damages for alleged side-effects of COVID-19 vaccines.
Another law firm, Caesar-Preller, says it is representing 100 cases, with both firms saying separately they cover almost all cases in Germany between them.
A handful of similar cases have been filed in Italy.",Reuters,"Jun 12, 2023 3:00 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/elon-musk-neuralink-fda-approval-study-brain-implants-humans/,Elon Musk’s Neuralink gets FDA approval for study of brain implants in humans,"Elon Musk’s brain-implant company Neuralink on Thursday, May 25,  said it had received a green light from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to kickstart its first-in-human clinical study, a critical milestone after earlier struggles to gain approval.
The FDA nod “represents an important first step that will one day allow our technology to help many people,” Neuralink said in a tweet. It did not elaborate on the aims of the study, saying only that it was not recruiting yet and more details would be available soon.
The FDA acknowledged in a statement that the agency cleared Neuralink to use its brain implant and surgical robot for trials on patients but declined to provide more details.
Neuralink and Musk did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Victor Krauthamer, an adjunct biomedical engineering professor who spent three decades at the FDA, including a stint overseeing the office that reviews human-trial requests for brain implants, said the FDA does not typically inspect facilities as part of their review of applications for clinical trials. But he added this would have been warranted in this case, given the concerns around Neuralink’s animal experiments.
“If the animal testing is unreliable, then (human trial) approval may be based on flawed animal safety data. The FDA should have verified their trust of animal study results,” Krauthamer said.
Neuralink had hoped to receive approval to implant its device in 10 patients, Reuters has reported. But more recently, the company was negotiating a lower number of patients with the agency after it raised safety concerns, current and former employees said. It is not known how many patients the FDA ultimately approved.
Musk envisions brain implants could cure a range of conditions including obesity, autism, depression and schizophrenia as well as enabling Web browsing and telepathy. He made headlines late last year when he said he was so confident in the devices’ safety that he would be willing to implant them in his children.
On at least four occasions since 2019, Musk predicted Neuralink would begin human trials. But the company sought FDA approval only in early 2022, and the agency rejected the application, Reuters reported in March.
The FDA had pointed out several safety concerns to Neuralink that needed to be addressed before sanctioning human trials, Reuters reported. Some of the issues involved the lithium battery of the device, the possibility of the implant’s wires migrating within the brain, and the challenge of safely extracting the device without damaging brain tissue.",Reuters,"May 26, 2023 9:44 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/internet-culture/social-media-could-harm-youth-mental-health/,"Social media could harm youth mental health, US Surgeon General warns","Social media can profoundly harm the mental health of youth, particularly adolescent girls, the US Surgeon General warned in an advisory on Tuesday, May 23, and he called for safeguards from tech companies for children who are at critical stages of brain development.
US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said that while social media offers some benefits, there are “ample indicators that social media could also harm children’s well-being.”
“We are in the middle of a national youth mental health crisis, and I am concerned that social media is an important driver of that crisis – one that we must urgently address,” Murthy said.
Social media use may cause and perpetuate body image issues, affect eating behaviors and sleep quality, and lead to social comparison and low self-esteem, especially among adolescent girls, the advisory said, citing responses from a survey conducted among adolescents.
Adolescents who spend more than three hours per day on social media face double the risk of experiencing poor mental health outcomes, such as symptoms of depression and anxiety, according to the advisory.
Most adolescents say social media helps them feel more accepted, more supported during tough times, more connected to their friends, and more creative, the advisory also said.
It said policymakers should strengthen safety standards in ways that enhance those benefits for children of all ages, while noting that inappropriate and harmful content continues to be easily and widely accessible to children.
Tech companies should adhere to age limits to control access to social media platforms, and be transparent about data regarding the impact of their products on children, the advisory urges.
Algorithms and platform design should seek to maximize the potential benefits of social media instead of features designed to make users spend more time on them, it said.
“The first principle of healthcare is to do no harm – that’s the same standard we need to start holding social media platforms to,” said Saul Levin, CEO of the American Psychiatric Association.
The report includes suggestions for what parents, tech companies, as well as children and adolescents, can do to avoid dangerous pitfalls and make the social media experience more positive. They include creation of a family media plan, encouraging of in-person friendships, talking to children about how they spend their time online, and encouraging them to seek help should they need it.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/wegovy-weight-loss-drugs-no-silver-bullet-world-health-organization-obesity-review/,"Wegovy, other weight loss drugs ‘no silver bullet,’ says WHO amid obesity review","LONDON, United Kingdom – New highly-effective weight loss drugs such as Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy are not a “silver bullet” for addressing the rapid rise in global obesity rates, the World Health Organization’s nutrition chief told Reuters, as the agency conducts its first review of obesity management guidelines in more than 20 years.
The global health body is first revising guidelines for treating children and adolescents with obesity, and will then update recommendations for adults, said Francesco Branca, WHO director of nutrition and food safety.
The WHO last issued global guidelines on the topic in 2000, which are used as a blueprint for countries without the resources to draft their own plans.
As part of the work, the WHO has commissioned the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research, in Milan, Italy, to assess the evidence for the use of all drugs for children and adolescents – from older options like GSK’s Xenical to newer, more effective treatments like Wegovy and Eli Lilly and Co’s  Mounjaro, Branca told Reuters.
“The kind of communication that has been done around these drugs – ‘We’ve found a solution’ – that’s wrong,” said Branca. Drugs for obesity are important but must be “part of a comprehensive approach,” he said. “This is not a silver bullet.”
Branca said that other interventions, including diet and exercise, remain critical to help manage obesity. The latest WHO data shows that the percentage of children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 who are obese or overweight has risen to just over 18% in 2016 from 4% in 1975, and this now represents more than 340 million people.
Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Wegovy and Mounjaro were originally developed for type 2 diabetes to help control blood glucose. More recently, they have been shown to help people lose around 15% of their body weight, capturing the attention of patients, investors, and even celebrities.
Part of a class of drugs known as GLP-1 agonists, they are given by a weekly injection and work by affecting hunger signals to the brain and slowing the rate at which a person’s stomach empties, making them feel full longer.
Studies suggest people are likely to have to take the drugs for the rest of their lives to keep the weight off.
Wegovy is approved for weight-loss in the United States and Europe, while Mounjaro is expected to receive US approval later this year. The enormous demand for the drugs is expected to be worth $100 billion in annual sales within a decade, with as many as 10 different drugs on the market.
US medical groups are also reviewing their obesity treatment guidelines to consider the best use of Wegovy and similar drugs, with some specialists advocating broad use while others recommend prioritizing them for high-risk patients with health conditions, like diabetes or heart disease, that are exacerbated by excess weight.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended using such medicines in children age 12 or older with obesity, even though the long-term impacts have yet to be studied.
The WHO said its revised guidelines will be based on more robust methodology than previous iterations and include up-to-the-minute science. The first draft of the new management guidelines for children and adolescents are expected by the end of this year.
Branca said the researchers at Mario Negri, as well as other institutions working on the guidelines, had been extensively vetted to avoid conflict of interest concerns.
Novo Nordisk was suspended earlier this year from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry for its marketing practices, such alleged funding of health professionals and providing training that the association alleged was intended to promote its drug.
“We really screen the potential conflicts of interest,” said Branca.
He described obesity as a “rising epidemic.”
“There are multiple reasons why we really have to take much more serious and bolder action,” he said.",Reuters,"May 12, 2023 2:11 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/university-of-philippines-study-birth-control-pills-lower-hormone-levels-still-effective/,UP study shows birth control pills with lower hormone levels still effective,"MANILA, Philippines – Hormones in contraceptive pills can be reduced by as much as 92% and still be effective, mathematicians have found in a new study.
In the study, where researchers analyzed the hormone levels of 23 women aged 20 to 34 with regular menstrual cycles, it was found that estrogen-only contraceptives could work just as effectively even if hormone doses were reduced by as much as 92%.
As for progestrone-only contraceptives, hormone doses can be lowered by 43% and still have the same effectivity, they found.
The study was undertaken by University of the Philippines (UP) mathematics associate professor Aurelio de los Reyes V and PhD mathematics graduate Brenda Lyn Gavina, along with their collaborators Mette Olufsen of the North Carolina State University, Suzanne Lenhart of the University of Tennessee, and Johnny Ottesen of the Roskilde University of Denmark.
In the study, the researchers tracked natural hormone levels and the effect of hormones taken through contraceptives through a modified menstrual cycle model they developed.
Using math, they determined the lowest amount of hormones needed to prevent ovulation. Apart from the finding that lower hormone dosages can still be effective, the researchers also found that taking the pills before the tenth day of the menstrual cycle can be just as effective as a daily dose in preventing pregnancy.
“With the rapid development of new implants and injections providing continuous administration, there is great potential to implement new treatment scheme minimizing dose,” the researchers said. The study was published in the PLoS Computational Biology on April 13.
UP professor De Los Reyes said that their study suggests an “effective and cost-efficient hormonal contraceptive administration,” and contributes to a “longstanding objective” of safer contraceptive through reducing the dosage of hormonal contraceptives.
“We also hope to build on the current model to investigate reproductive health concerns in women like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and ovarian cysts. We would like to caution that our model is not directly translatable to clinical setup (or actual patients) as of yet, but the principles and its proof of concept could be potentially implemented to achieve safe and cost-efficient contraception,” said De Los Reyes.
Birth control pills are the most popular modern contraceptive method among women in the Philippines as of 2022. However, some pill users have to deal with side effects like spotting, bleeding, sore breasts, nausea, or headaches.
According to a 2022 article from the Australian Prescriber journal, hormonal contraception is also known to precipitate or perpetuate depression in some patients. Some older generations of birth control pills that contain ethinylestradiol are linked to severe mood problems, while newer generations containing physiological forms of estrogen may be more tolerable, with a weaker link to mood problems.
More than 8 million Filipinos used modern birth control methods in 2020, according to the Philippine Commission on Population and Development.
Reproductive health in the Philippines is a multidimensional issue, as adolescent pregnancy remains prevalent, and not all women are empowered to make decisions over their own bodies. ([READ] ‘Nandiyan na’: Young Filipinas accept pregnancy as duty, but stigma remains – study)

https://www.rappler.com/world/covid-no-longer-global-health-emergency-world-health-organization/,WHO declares end to COVID global health emergency,"LONDON, United Kingdom – The World Health Organization on Friday, May 5, declared an end to COVID-19 as a global health emergency, marking a major step toward the end of the pandemic that has killed more than 6.9 million people, disrupted the global economy and ravaged communities.
The WHO’s Emergency Committee met on Thursday, May 5, and recommended the UN-agency declare an end to the coronavirus crisis as a “public health emergency of international concern”, which has been in place for over three years.
“It is therefore with great hope that I declare COVID-19 over as a global health emergency,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, adding that the end of the emergency did not mean COVID was over as a global health threat.
The WHO’s emergency committee first declared that COVID represented its highest level of alert on January 30, 2020. The status helps focus international attention on a global health threat, as well as bolstering collaboration on vaccines and treatments.
The decision to end the global health emergency status was supported by a majority of the committee, said Didier Houssin, head of the agency’s COVID emergency committee.
Lifting it is a sign of the progress the world has made fighting the disease, but COVID-19 is here to stay, the WHO has said, even if it no longer represents an emergency.
The death rate has slowed from a peak of more than 100,000 people per week in January 2021 to just over 3,500 in the week to April 24, 2023, according to WHO data, reflecting widespread vaccination, availability of better treatments and a level of population immunity from prior infections.
Ending the emergency could mean that international collaboration or funding efforts are also brought to an end or shift in focus, although many have already adapted as the pandemic has receded in different regions.
“The battle is not over. We still have weaknesses and those weaknesses that we still have in our system will be exposed by this virus or another virus. And it needs to be fixed,” said the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan.
The WHO does not declare the beginning or end of pandemics, although it did start using the term for COVID in March 2020.
“In most cases, pandemics truly end when the next pandemic begins,” Ryan said.
Last year, US President Joe Biden said the pandemic was over. Like a number of other countries, the world’s biggest economy has begun dismantling its domestic state of emergency for COVID, which officially ends May 11, meaning it will stop paying for vaccines and testing for many people and shift responsibility to the commercial market.
Other regions have taken similar steps. The European Union said in April last year the emergency phase of the pandemic was over, and the WHO’s African head, Matshidiso Moeti, said in December it was time to move to routine management of COVID across the continent.
The WHO’s declaration comes just four months after China ended its prolonged severe COVID restrictions and was ravaged by a big surge in infections.
In many parts of the world, testing has dwindled dramatically, and people have largely stopped wearing masks. In some countries, mask-wearing mandates have resumed during COVID outbreaks.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/china-weighs-giving-single-women-ivf-access-stem-population-decline/,China weighs giving single women IVF access to stem population decline,"As China tries to slow its demographic decline, women like Chen Luojin could be part of the solution.
The divorced 33-year-old lives in Chengdu, capital of the southwestern Sichuan province, which legalized registration of children by unmarried women in February, something China is considering implementing nationwide to address record low birth rates.
The changes mean unmarried women can take paid maternity leave and receive child subsidies previously only available to married couples. Crucially, Chen could access in-vitro fertility (IVF) treatment legally in a private clinic.
She is now 10 weeks pregnant.
“Becoming a single parent is not for everyone, but I’m happy with the decision,” said Chen, who works in logistics. “Equally, getting married or not is for each individual to decide. We have liberalized the policies here and I know a lot of single women are doing IVF.”
Concerned about China’s first population drop in six decades and its rapid aging, the government’s political advisers proposed in March that single and unmarried women should have access to egg freezing and IVF treatment, among other services. China’s leaders have not commented publicly on the recommendations.
Liberalizing IVF nationwide could unleash more demand for fertility treatment in what is already the world’s biggest market, straining limited fertility services. Some investors in the industry see an opportunity to expand.
“If China changes their policy to allow single women to have children, this can result in an increase of IVF demand,” said Yve Lyppens, director of business development for Asia Pacific at INVO Bioscience, which is awaiting regulatory approval to launch its IVF technology in China after signing a distribution agreement with Guangzhou-based Onesky Holdings last year.
“However, if there is a sudden increase, China will have an even larger capacity issue.”
China’s National Health Commission (NHC) did not respond to a request for comment about liberalizing IVF access, though it has previously acknowledged that many young women are delaying plans to marry and have children, noting that high costs of education and child-rearing have contributed to declining marriage rates.
The NHC’s Sichuan branch did not address questions from Reuters about whether it would offer IVF treatment to all women in public hospitals. When it announced the changes in February, Sichuan’s NHC said they aimed to “promote long-term and balanced population development.”
Shanghai and the southern Guangdong province have also permitted unmarried women to register their children but IVF services for single women remain banned.
Lyppens said most IVF clinics in China operated at full capacity before the COVID-19 pandemic, and are likely to be in a similar situation again soon as the country has lifted virus-related curbs. There are no estimates for how many patients want but cannot access treatment, but some women benefiting from it say they spend hours waiting for their turn.
“The queues in the hospital are very long,” said 34-year-old Xiangyu, a married woman undergoing IVF in Chongqing, some 300 kilometers east of Chengdu. She spoke on the condition of partial anonymity for privacy reasons.
Chinese hospitals and clinics, both public and private, provide about 1 million rounds of IVF treatment – or cycles – annually, compared with 1.5 million in the rest of the world, according to academic journals and industry experts.
The price for a cycle – which involves medication for ovarian stimulation, egg collection, insemination in a laboratory and embryo transfer – is regulated in China. It ranges between $3,500 and $4,500, about a quarter of US prices.
China has 539 public and private IVF facilities, and the NHC has said it aims to set up one facility for every 2.3 million people by 2025, which would take the total above 600.
China’s IVF market, including treatment, drugs and equipment, is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 14.5% in coming years, nearly doubling to 85.4 billion yuan ($12.4 billion) in 2025 from 49.7 billion yuan, research house Leadleo estimated in a report last year. Vivian Zhang, managing director of Merck China, which provides fertility products and services for IVF clinics in the country, said cities in the less-affluent inland provinces are quickly developing fertility centers similar to those in Beijing and Shanghai.
“There is a huge unmet medical need for Chinese patients,” said Zhang, adding she was “very optimistic” about the IVF market in China.
Gender power imbalances, the stigma in Chinese society that single pregnant women face, and the lack of social surveys make it difficult to quantify total demand and how much it would grow should the reforms be introduced in the near future, industry experts say.
But proxies exist.
Camila Caso, director of platform at Recharge Capital, which invests in fertility clinics and technology, said 500,000 IVF cycles are provided to Chinese women annually in clinics in other countries – a third of all cycles outside China.
Many Chinese women prefer clinics abroad if they are single, or if they want to do various genetic tests or choose the sex of the child, Caso said. A three-decade-old Chinese law designed to address a gender imbalance bars parents from learning the sex of a fetus.
The country implemented a rigid one-child policy from 1980 until 2015 – the root of many of its demographic challenges that have allowed India to become the world’s most populous nation. The limit has since been raised to three children.
Caso said her fund was currently rolling out two clinics in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur and aims to have around 15 in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore in the next three to four years. The fund is not investing in China because of uncertainty over IVF incentives, she said, adding that Recharge could capture Chinese demand via the Southeast Asian market.
Lu Weiying, a Chinese political adviser and chief expert at the Reproductive Medical Center of Women and Children in China’s southern Hainan province, said she submitted a proposal to the country’s leaders in March to give single women access to egg freezing, a procedure more and more people were seeking.
“People in China are marrying and having children much later than previously, which has led to an increase in infertility, miscarriage, and increased risk of fetal abnormalities,” she said.
In the United States, the average success rate of an IVF cycle is 52%, the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology says.
In China, the rate is a little over 30%, due in part to high levels of stress among women and a rising average age for having children, said Lin Haiwei, director of Beijing Perfect Family Hospital, which specializes in fertility treatments. Overseas experts say the quality of some IVF laboratories in China is also lower.
Improving access to fertility services won’t fix China’s demographic problem on its own, with factors from low incomes to expensive education, a feeble social safety net, and high gender inequality needing more attention, according to population experts.
But it can still make an impact.
Lin estimates that already around 300,000 babies are born in China via IVF annually – some 3% of newborns.
“I believe a related policy will come out in the near future that can satisfy many people’s desire to have a child,” Lin said.
While more Chinese women have postponed or given up on having babies in recent years, many still want to become mothers.
Joy Yang, a 22-year-old international finance major from Hunan province, said she first heard of IVF on television and she wants it liberalized nationwide, in case she does not find a partner but her financial situation allows her to have a child.
“There are some women who don’t want to get married but they still want to have children. I might choose to do IVF,” said Yang.",Reuters,"Apr 29, 2023 10:46 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/dirty-truth-stop-using-phone-toilet/,The dirty truth about your phone – and why you need to stop scrolling in the bathroom,"We carry them everywhere, take them to bed, to the bathroom and for many people they’re the first thing they see in the morning – more than 90% of the world owns or uses a mobile phone and many of us couldn’t manage without one.
But while health concerns about phones use usually focus on the distraction they can cause while driving, the possible effects of radiofrequency exposure, or just how addictive they can be. The microbial infection risk of your phone is much less appreciated – but it’s very real.
A 2019 survey found that most people in the UK use their phones on the toilet. So it’s not surprising to discover studies have found our mobile phones to be dirtier that toilet seats.
We give our phones to children to play with (who aren’t exactly well known for their hygiene). We also eat while using our phones and put them down on all sorts of (dirty) surfaces. All of which can transfer microbes onto your phone along with food deposits for those microbes to eat.
It’s been estimated that people touch their phone hundreds if not thousands of times a day. And while many of us wash our hands regularly after say, going to the bathroom, cooking, cleaning, or gardening, we are much less likely to consider washing our hands after touching our phones. But given how disgusting and germ-infested phones can be, maybe it’s time to think more about mobile phone hygiene.
Hands pick up bacteria and viruses all the time and are recognized as a route for acquiring infection. So too are the phones we touch. A number of studies conducted on the microbiological colonization of mobile phones show that they can be contaminated with many different kinds of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
These include the diarrhoea-inducing E. coli (which, by the way, comes from human poo) and the skin-infecting Staphylococcus, as well as Actinobacteria, which can cause tuberculosis and diphtheria, Citrobacter, which can lead to painful urinary tract infections, and Enterococcus, which is known to cause meningitis. Klebsiella, Micrococcus, Proteus, Pseudomonas and Streptococcus have also been found on phones and all can have equally nasty effects on humans.
Research has found that many pathogens on phones are often antibiotic resistant, meaning they can’t be treated with conventional drugs. This is worrying as these bacteria can cause skin, gut and respiratory infections that can be life-threatening.
Research has also found that even if you clean your phone with antibacterial wipes or alcohol it can still be recolonized by microorganisms, indicating that sanitization must be a regular process.
Phones contain plastic which can harbor and transmit viruses some of which (the common cold virus) can live on hard plastic surfaces for up to a week. Other viruses such as COVID-19, rotavirus (a highly infectious stomach bug that typically affects babies and young children), influenza and norovirus – which can cause serious respiratory and gut infections – can persist in an infectable form for several days.
Indeed, since the beginning of the COVID pandemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has introduced guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting mobile phones – which, along with door handles, cash machines and lift buttons, are considered reservoirs of infection.
In particular, concern has been raised about the role mobile phones can play in the spread of infectious microbes in hospital and healthcare settings, as well as in schools.
So it’s clear that you need to start cleaning your phone regularly. The US Federal Communications Commission actually recommends daily sanitation of your phone and other devices – not least because we are still within an active COVID-19 pandemic and the virus can survive for several days on hard plastic surfaces.
Use alcohol-based wipes or sprays. They need to contain at least 70% alcohol to disinfect phone casings and touch screens, and it needs to be done every day if possible.
Do not spray sanitisers directly onto the phone and keep liquids away from connection points or other phone openings. Absolutely avoid using bleach or abrasive cleaners. And wash your hands thoroughly after you’ve finished cleaning.
Thinking about how you handle your phone will also help to avoid it becoming colonized with germs. When not at home, keep your phone in your pocket, or bag and use a disposable paper list of to-do items, rather than constantly consulting your phone. Touch your phone with clean hands – washed with soap and water or disinfected with alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
There are other things you can do to avoid your phone becoming a source of viruses. Do not share your phone with others if you have any infection, or have not first sanitized it. If children are allowed to play with your phone, sanitize it as soon as possible afterwards.
And get in the habit of putting your phone away when not in use, then sanitizing or washing your hands. You might also want to occasionally sanitize your phone charger when you are cleaning your phone. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/genome-project-shows-how-humans-fit-other-mammals/,Ambitious genome project shows how humans fit with other mammals,"WASHINGTON, DC, USA – Scientists on Thursday, April 28, unveiled the results of a project comparing the genomes of 240 mammal species – from aardvarks and aye-ayes to zebus and zebras, as well as people – to trace evolutionary changes spanning 100 million years, pinpointing genetic traits widely shared and those more uniquely human.
The findings in the ambitious Zoonomia Project identified parts of the genome functionally important in people and other mammals and showed how certain mutations can cause disease. The project revealed the genetics of uncommon mammalian traits like hibernation and showed how the sense of smell varies widely.
The researchers said the findings on hibernation genetics could inform human therapeutics, critical care and long-distance space flight. The Zoonomia findings also can help identify genetic mutations that lead to disease, with one study scrutinizing patients with a brain cancer called medulloblastoma.
“We’re taking advantage of the fact that there’s this massive biodiversity on this planet to actually understand ourselves and make new discoveries that are relevant to treating human diseases,” said Elinor Karlsson, director of the Vertebrate Genomics Group at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and co-leader of the international consortium of researchers.
“The human genome was sequenced more than 20 years ago and, despite that, it’s still really hard to understand what the functional elements are,” added consortium co-leader Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, a comparative genomics professor at Uppsala University in Sweden.
The findings, detailed in 11 studies published in the journal Science, involved placentals, by far the world’s most common mammalian assemblage, known for giving birth to well-developed babies, and not egg-laying monotremes or pouched marsupials.
The project examined most existing mammalian lineages, though only 4% of species. They ranged in size from the North Pacific right whale, at 59 feet (18 meters) long, to the bumblebee bat, at 1.2 inches (3 cm) long. Our closest evolutionary relatives – chimpanzees and bonobos – were included, along with the western lowland gorilla and Sumatran orangutan.
Felines included the cheetah, Siberian tiger, jaguar, leopard and humble domestic cat. Canines included a celebrity – Alaskan sled dog Balto, famed for bringing lifesaving medicine in 1925 to the city of Nome. The most primitive species was the venomous burrowing insect-eater Hispaniola solenodon, closely related to mammals alive during the dinosaur age.
The researchers identified genomic elements – 4,552 in all – that were pretty much the same across all mammals and were identical in at least 235 of the 240 species, including people.
“Many of these elements are located close to genes involved in embryo development – a process that needs to be tightly controlled if it is to result in the development of a healthy and functioning animal,” said Uppsala University evolutionary geneticist Matthew Christmas, lead author of one of the papers.
In terms of human differences from other mammals, the study pointed to regions associated with developmental and neurological genes. This suggests that evolution of human-specific traits since our species Homo sapiens diverged from a common ancestor with chimpanzees perhaps 6-7 million years ago has involved changes to regulation of nervous system genes.
“This makes sense as some of the biggest differences between us and our ape cousins are in our ‘brain power’ and cognition. It seems that a lot of what makes us human comes down to tweaks in the way that neurological genes are regulated, rather than any big changes in the genes themselves,” Christmas said.
The research showed that placentals, dating to about 100 million years ago, began diversifying before the asteroid strike 66 million years ago that doomed the dinosaurs and enabled mammals to go from subordinate to dominant.
Zoonomia demonstrated how some mammals have a very keen sense of smell – Hoffman’s two-toed sloth, the nine-banded armadillo and the African savanna elephant – while others have almost none – whales and dolphins. Humans were somewhat average.",Reuters,"Apr 28, 2023 9:00 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/health-and-wellness/oral-sex-now-leading-risk-factor-throat-cancer/,Oral sex is now the leading risk factor for throat cancer,"Over the past two decades, there has been a rapid increase in throat cancer in the west, to the extent that some have called it an epidemic. This has been due to a large rise in a specific type of throat cancer called oropharyngeal cancer (the area of the tonsils and back of the throat). The main cause of this cancer is the human papillomavirus (HPV), which are also the main cause of cancer of the cervix. Oropharyngeal cancer has now become more common than cervical cancer in the US and the UK.
HPV is sexually transmitted. For oropharyngeal cancer, the main risk factor is the number of lifetime sexual partners, especially oral sex. Those with six or more lifetime oral-sex partners are 8.5 times more likely to develop oropharyngeal cancer than those who do not practice oral sex.
Behavioral trends studies show that oral sex is very prevalent in some countries. In a study that my colleagues and I conducted in almost 1,000 people having tonsillectomy for non-cancer reasons in the UK, 80% of adults reported practicing oral sex at some point in their lives. Yet, mercifully, only a small number of those people develop oropharyngeal cancer. Why that is, is not clear.
The prevailing theory is that most of us catch HPV infections and are able to clear them completely. However, a small number of people are not able to get rid of the infection, maybe due to a defect in a particular aspect of their immune system. In those patients, the virus is able to replicate continuously, and over time integrates at random positions into the host’s DNA, some of which can cause the host cells to become cancerous.
HPV vaccination of young girls has been implemented in many countries to prevent cervical cancer. There is now increasing, albeit as yet indirect evidence, that it may also be effective in preventing HPV infection in the mouth. There is also some evidence to suggest that boys are also protected by “herd immunity” in countries where there is high vaccine coverage in girls (over 85%). Taken together, this may hopefully lead in a few decades to the reduction of oropharyngeal cancer.
That is well and good from a public health point of view, but only if coverage among girls is high – over 85%, and only if one remains within the covered “herd.” It does not, however, guarantee protection at an individual level – and especially in this age of international travel – if, for example, someone has sex with someone from a country with low coverage. It certainly does not afford protection in countries where vaccine coverage of girls is low, for example, the US where only 54.3% of adolescents aged 13 to 15 years had received two or three HPV vaccination doses in 2020.
This has led several countries, including the UK, Australia, and the US, to extend their national recommendations for HPV vaccination to include young boys – called a gender-neutral vaccination policy.
But having a universal vaccination policy does not guarantee coverage. There is a significant proportion of some populations who are opposed to HPV vaccination due to concerns about safety, necessity, or, less commonly, due to concerns about encouraging promiscuity.
Paradoxically, there is some evidence from population studies that, possibly in an effort to abstain from penetrative intercourse, young adults may practice oral sex instead, at least initially.
The coronavirus pandemic has brought its own challenges, too. First, reaching young people at schools was not possible for a period of time. Second, there has been an increasing trend in general vaccine hesitancy, or “anti-vax” attitudes, in many countries, which may also contribute to a reduction in vaccine uptake.
As always when dealing with populations and behavior, nothing is simple or straightforward. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/woman-spends-500-days-cave-how-extreme-isolation-alter-sense-of-time/,Woman spends 500 days alone in a cave – how extreme isolation can alter your sense of time,"A year and half alone in a cave might sound like a nightmare to a lot of people, but Spanish athlete Beatriz Flamini emerged with a cheerful grin and said she thought she had more time to finish her book.
She had almost no contact with the outside world during her impressive feat of human endurance. For 500 days, she documented her experiences to help scientists understand the effects of extreme isolation.
One of the first things that became apparent on April 12, 2023, when she emerged from the cave was how fluid time is, shaped more by your personality traits and the people around you than a ticking clock.
When talking to reporters about her experiences, Flamini explained she rapidly lost her sense of time. The loss of time was so profound that, when her support team came to retrieve her, she was surprised that her time was up, instead believing she had only been there for 160 to 170 days.
Our actions, emotions, and changes in our environment can have powerful effects on the way in which our minds process time.
For most people, the rising and setting of the sun mark the passing of days, and work and social routines mark the passing of hours. In the darkness of an underground cave, without the company of others, many signals of passing of time will have disappeared. So Flamini may have become more reliant on psychological processes to monitor time.
One way in which we keep track of the passage of time is memory. If we don’t know how long we have been doing something for, we use the number of memories formed during the event as an index to the amount of time that has passed. The more memories we form in an event or era, the longer we perceive it to have lasted.
Busy days and weeks filled with lots of novel and exciting events are typically remembered as longer than more monotonous ones where nothing noteworthy happens.
For Flamini, the absence of social interaction combined with a lack of information about family and current affairs (the war in Ukraine, the reopening of society after COVID lockdowns), may have significantly reduced the number of memories she formed during her isolation. Flamini herself noted: “I’m still stuck on November 21, 2021. I don’t know anything about the world.”
The loss of time may also reflect the reduced importance of time in cave life. In the outside world, the busyness of modern life, and social pressure to avoid wasting time, mean many of us live in a perpetual state of time stress. For us, the clock is a gauge of how productive and successful we are as adults.
Flamini is not the first to experience a change in her experience of time after a change in environment. Similar experiences were reported by French scientist Michel Siffre during his two- to six-month-long cave expeditions in the 1960s and 70s.
A loss of sense of time was consistently reported by adults and children who spent prolonged periods isolated in nuclear bunkers (for research purposes) at the height of the cold war. It is also frequently reported by people serving prison sentences and was widely experienced by the general public during COVID-19 lockdowns.
Caves, nuclear bunkers, prisons and global pandemics share two features which seem to create an altered sense of time. They isolate us from the wider world and involve confined spaces.
Flamini, however, lived with an empty schedule stretching out into her future. No work meetings to prepare for, no appointments to hurry to and no social diary to manage.
She led a self-paced existence, where she could eat, sleep, and read as and when she liked. She occupied herself painting, exercising and documenting her experiences. This may have made the passage of time irrelevant.
As the biological rhythms of sleep, thirst and digestion took over from the ticking hands of the clock, Flamini may have simply paid less and less attention to the passage of time, causing her to eventually lose track of it.
Flamini’s ability to let go of time may have been enhanced by her strong desire to achieve her 500-day goal. After all, she decided to go into the cave and she could leave if she wanted to.
For people who become confined against their will, time can become a prison itself. Prisoners of war and people serving prison sentences often report that monitoring the passage of time can become an obsession. It would seem that we are only able to really let go of time when we are in control of it.
Flamini’s freedom may make leaving civilization behind for the caves look like an appealing prospect. However, life underground is not for the fainthearted. Survival depends upon your ability to maintain a high level of mental resilience.
If you have have the ability to remain calm and composed when things get tough, a strong belief that you are in control of your own behaviors, known as an internal locus of control, and become easily absorbed in your own thoughts, you made have the fortitude to succeed. However, you might find it simpler to switch off your notifications, clear the calendar and get lost in a bit of me time. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/prevalence-causes-of-dysmenorrhea/,Probing into period pain: How prevalent is dysmenorrhea and what causes it?,"MANILA, Philippines – Gabriela Representative Arlene Brosas filed on March 22 House Bill No. 7758, which seeks to grant paid menstrual leave of at most two days per month to female employees in both the private and public sectors.
In her explanatory note, Brosas explained that dysmenorrhea or painful menstruation is “poorly treated and ignored” by health professionals and even women themselves, and that women need flexibility and support in managing their reproductive health without facing negative consequences.
Cotabato 3rd District Representative Alana Santos earlier filed a similar bill, House Bill No. 6828. “The real impact of menstruation on women and society is underestimated,” Santos said in the explanatory note.
“By pursuing this bill, we are not only acknowledging and protecting the women’s health but also, we are raising awareness to avoid stigmatization and ensure that individuals receive the right support,” Santos added.
Dysmenorrhea is defined as the pain felt during menstruation. It manifests through different symptoms, including cramps and pain in the lower abdomen, low back pain, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and headaches.
Here are the different types of dysmenorrhea, its causes, and its prevalence:
Primary dysmenorrhea is the pain felt around one to two days before or during menstruation, and lasts from one to three days. It is marked by abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and sometimes irritable bowel or diarrhea.
Primary dysmenorrhea is usually caused by strong contraction of the uterus, which interrupts blood flow. This decreases oxygen in the uterus, causing pain.
Primary dysmenorrhea is experienced by 45% to 95% of menstruating women. It usually regresses after a woman gives birth or as they get older.
Secondary dysmenorrhea is caused by the presence of organic or pathologic entities in the female reproductive system. It also may last longer than three days. It is not associated with other symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or bowel irritability.
The following are some of the conditions that cause secondary dysmenorrhea:
Endometriosis is a chronic disease where tissue similar to the uterus lining grows outside the uterus. The disease causes pain and sometimes infertility.
Globally, roughly 10% or 190 million women of reproductive age have endometriosis. In February, the Philippine General Hospital also noted an increase in women experiencing pelvic pain later diagnosed as endometriosis.
There is currently no cure for endometriosis. The pain, however, can be managed with hormonal medications and lifestyle change.
Adenomyosis is a condition that enlarges the uterus. It is caused by tissue in the lining of the uterus growing into the muscular wall of the uterus. It causes heavy menstrual bleeding.
From January 2011 to June 2014, adenomyosis was one of the most common reasons for hysterectomy procedures or the surgical removal of the uterus in the Philippine General Hospital.
Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids or myomas) are the most common benign or non-spreading tumors that grow in or on the wall of the uterus. Patients with uterine fibroids experience symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pressure, and sometimes pain.
According to a study published by the Philippine Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 77% of women have uterine fibroids, 30% to 40% of them symptomatic. These women were mostly in their 30s and 40s.
Uterine fibroids can be surgically removed.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is caused by a hormonal imbalance that leads to infertility, disordered menstrual cycle, masculinization, and weight gain. It also leads to long-term complications such as diabetes and increased risk of ovarian cancer.
Around 4.5 million Filipinos have PCOS, which makes the condition the major cause of infertility in the Philippines.
Since PCOS cannot be cured, management of the symptoms is the main treatment for the condition through medication and lifestyle changes. – Laurice Angeles/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/world-health-organization-consider-adding-obesity-drugs-essential-medicines-list/,WHO to consider adding obesity drugs to ‘essential’ medicines list,"LONDON, United Kingdom – Drugs that combat obesity could for the first time be included on the World Health Organization’s “essential medicines list,” used to guide government purchasing decisions in low- and middle-income countries, the U.N. agency told Reuters.
A panel of advisers to the WHO will review new requests for drugs to be included next month, with an updated essential medicines list due in September.
The request to consider obesity drugs was submitted by three doctors and a researcher in the United States. It covers the active ingredient liraglutide in Novo Nordisk’s obesity drug Saxenda, which will come off patent soon, allowing for cheaper generic versions.
The panel could reject the request or wait for more evidence. A decision by the WHO to include Saxenda and eventual generics on the list would mark a new approach to global obesity by the health agency.
It could also pave the way for a newer, more powerful treatment from Novo Nordisk called Wegovy to be recommended for low- and middle-income countries in future.
However, some public health experts warn against introducing such medicines too broadly as a solution to a complex condition that is still not completely understood.
“Obesity is an increasingly important health problem in many countries,” said a WHO spokesperson. “Medicines for the treatment of obesity are only one aspect of management, of course, and prevention is also crucial.”
The WHO said the expert panel would consider the evidence for liraglutide over the coming months. They may also seek a broader evaluation of other types of weight-loss treatments in the future.
Over 650 million adults worldwide are obese, more than triple the rate in 1975, and roughly another 1.3 billion are overweight, according to the WHO. The majority – 70% – live in low- and middle-income countries.
Including obesity drugs among the WHO’s essential medicines could have great significance for that population. Experts say that adding HIV drugs to the list in 2002 helped to make them much more widely available to AIDS patients in poorer countries.
“At present, there are no medications included in the (list) that specifically target weight loss for the ongoing global burden of obesity,” wrote U.S. researcher Dr. Sanjana Garimella from Yale New Haven Health, Dr. Sandeep Kishore from the University of California, San Francisco, and colleagues to the WHO in requesting the addition. They did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
They argue that while the list includes mineral supplements for nutritional deficiencies, the lack of weight-loss treatments represents a “discrepancy” in global health equity, given the increasing number of deaths in poorer nations hastened by weight-related illness, including heart disease and diabetes.
Saxenda, a once-daily injection, has been shown to help people reduce 5%-10% of their body weight, at $450 per month in the United States and $150 per month in Europe.
People using Wegovy, a weekly injection that costs more than $1,300 a month in the United States, have lost up to 15% of their weight. At the moment, Wegovy is in short supply and Novo is prioritizing its launch and distribution in the US and other wealthy markets.
The Danish drugmaker in a statement said it was not involved in the application to consider liraglutide for inclusion on the WHO list, adding, “we welcome the WHO review and look forward to the readout and decision.”
Both drugs belong to a class of medicines called GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have been used for years to treat diabetes. They affect hunger signals to the brain and slow the rate at which a person’s stomach empties, making them feel fuller longer. Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N has a similar diabetes drug nearing approval for weight loss.
For both Saxenda and Wegovy, there is a lack of long-term safety and effectiveness data for obesity. Studies suggest people will likely have to take the drugs for the rest of their lives to keep the weight off.
High-income countries are taking varying approaches for how to use these medicines, including contemplating whether they can be prescribed by government-sponsored health systems or covered by insurance, as they are for diabetes. In some countries, their use is being reserved only for the most at-risk groups.
Professor Zulfiqar Bhutta, an obesity expert at the University of Toronto, said the phenomenon of obesity in low- and middle-income countries must be better understood to help determine the best course of action
“Preventive strategies and sustained efforts at education, gender-focused interventions, must take precedence over the use of obesity drugs, which require a lot more research for safety and effectiveness,” he said.",Reuters,"Mar 29, 2023 2:49 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/who-changes-covid-19-vaccine-recommendations/,WHO changes COVID-19 vaccine recommendations,"The World Health Organization on Tuesday, March 28,  changed its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines, suggesting that high-risk populations should receive an additional dose 12 months after their last booster.
The health agency defined high-risk populations as older adults, as well as younger people with other significant risk factors. For this group, the agency recommends an additional shot of the vaccine either 6 or 12 months after the latest dose, based on factors such as age and immunocompromising conditions.
The WHO defined the group including healthy children and adolescents as “low priority” and urged countries to consider factors like disease burden before recommending vaccination of this group.
The recommendations come as countries take differing approaches for their populations. Some high-income countries like the United Kingdom and Canada are already offering high-risk people COVID-19 boosters this spring, six months after their last dose.
The WHO said this was an option for a subset of people who were at particular risk, but its recommendations were intended as a best practice global guide.

The virus was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019, with many suspecting the Huanan live animal market to be the source, before spreading round the world and killing nearly 7 million people.
The scientists published a pre-print report based on their interpretation of the data on Monday, March 20, after leaks in the media last week and a meeting with the World Health Organization, which has urged China to release more information.
The data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is no longer available on the GISAID database where it was found by the scientists.
It comprised new sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and additional genomic data based on samples taken from a live animal market in Wuhan in 2020, according to the scientists who accessed it.
The sequences showed that raccoon dogs and other animals susceptible to the coronavirus were present in the market and may have been infected, providing a new clue in the chain of transmission that eventually reached humans, they said.
“This adds to the body of evidence identifying the Huanan market as the spillover location of Sars-CoV-2 and the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said the report.
It was written by authors including the University of Arizona’s Michael Worobey, Kristian Andersen of Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, and Florence Débarre at the Sorbonne University in Paris, France, who accessed the data.
In comparison to the leaked information last week, the report adds more detail about other animals present at the market, as well as showing that some of the SARS-CoV-2 positive environmental samples had more animal than human genetic material in them, which the researchers said was consistent with the animals being infected.
WHO officials said last week that the information was not conclusive but did represent a new lead into the investigation into COVID’s origins, and should have been shared immediately.
The UN agency has previously said that all hypotheses for COVID-19’s origins remain on the table, including that the virus emerged from a high-security laboratory in Wuhan that studies dangerous pathogens.
China denies any such link. WHO has also said that most evidence points towards the virus coming from animals, likely bats.

Dina Zulueta, a wife, mother, yoga teacher, mindfulness meditation teacher, and prime mover of the Save the Trees Coalition based in Pampanga, shared her message of joy with matching happy and crying emojis on Wednesday, March 15, after receiving positive results from her positron emission tomography (PET) scan.
It marked the second time she overcame a life-threatening medical situation posed by cancer.
Dina’s first bout occurred in 2000 when she had been diagnosed with stage 4 lymphoma.
Her youngest daughter was just 10 months old at the time, and her initial response was, “Hindi ako puwedeng mamatay! (I won’t die!)”
Dina, who was 33 years old then, had lost her mother at the same age and did not want her children to experience the same loss.
She sought guidance from Dr. Omar Arabia II, a nutritional oncologist, who prescribed protocols for her that included a diet rich in certain fruits and vegetables while avoiding meat and processed foods.
Dina followed the prescribed protocols and underwent chemotherapy, ultimately achieving remission.
In 2021, Dina felt something in her breast and was advised to undergo a biopsy and chemotherapy. She was diagnosed with breast cancer.
She was determined, however, to avoid going through the chemotherapy process again. She said, “I have been through all that before.”
After reflecting on her experience, Dina recognized that she had been under enormous stress due to her involvement with the STC’s fight to protect 259 trees on the Fil-Am Friendship Road in Pampanga from being felled as part of a road-widening project by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).
(The STC is currently appealing the court’s decision to dissolve a temporary environmental protection order [TEPO].)
“They are ancient acacia and balete (genus Ficus) trees that form a canopy!” she exclaimed.
Dina had recovered from her first illness, and she had occasionally indulged in processed foods and sweet treats.
Fear set in for Dina when she received the news about her condition, but she refused to operate on it. Instead, she turned to meditation.
She consulted with Dr. Arabia who prescribed juicing, supplementation, and enema to boost her immune system before her mastectomy.
Dina recalled being told by the doctor, “We have to secure your body before they take it out so that your body can take it.”
There was also another issue: her tooth fillings.
Dina had also sought the advice of Dr. Rico Jose Manuel “Bok” David, whom she had met through a group that invites speakers for their discussions.
In an interview with Rappler, David explained that functional medicine does not offer a cure for cancer but can provide support and complementary treatment during the process.
David begins his treatment process by having patients complete a 17-page questionnaire, which helps assess the underlying causes of various illnesses.
He then works to eliminate harmful elements and replace them with healthy alternatives, such as swapping processed foods for vegetables.
“In Dina’s case, we looked into toxicity levels. There have been studies that have found that high levels of mercury toxicity are linked to some cancers. [In years past], dental amalgam fillings contained a huge amount of mercury,” David said.
He said the detoxification capacity varies among individuals. “It is not the same for every person because each person can detoxify. In Dina’s case, she was very stressed and her immune system was weak. But these are special cases, and apply to only 10% of the population.”
Dina underwent an expensive test that required samples of her hair, blood, and urine. Since such tests were not available in the Philippines, the samples were sent to a foreign laboratory.
The results showed that Dina’s level was in the 99th percentile which, according to Dina, meant that among all the people who had been tested, less than 1% had a higher level than hers.
To address the issue, Dina had her amalgam fillings removed from six of her teeth and drilled out of three others suspected to contain smaller amounts of mercury.
“It was so painful! But my dentist was so compassionate throughout the whole process,” she recounted.
Aside from removing the fillings, Dina followed David’s prescription of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and devoid of processed foods and sweets such as cakes and donuts.
The physician also recommended supplementation and infusion as part of her mercury detoxification plan.
In February 2023, Dina underwent testing for mercury levels in her blood and urine after six months of adhering to protocols.
She received the results on March 8 – incidentally, International Women’s Day and her youngest child’s 23rd birthday – and confirmed that her mercury levels had gone down from 0.0352 micrograms per gram to only 0.0049 ug/g.
“I did my research and I meditated long and hard on it. I listened to my body, and chose the path to health that truly resonated with me,” she said.
Acknowledging the support she received during her journey, Dina credited her family, including her husband Obet, daughters Pau, Miles, and Bea, and helpers Mhai and Zhed. She also expressed gratitude to her other physicians – Dr. Gab Cruz, Dr. May Cuballes, and Dr. Angel Aquino – as well as friends.
“I know and I feel they helped big time,” she said.
Now 54 years old, Dina says she feels happy, “I feel great and I feel strong!” Most importantly, it has been confirmed that she is cancer-free!",Mari-An C. Santos,"Mar 21, 2023 9:50 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/up-researchers-findings-gene-links-breast-cancer-stress-irregular-sleep/,"UP researchers discover gene links breast cancer, stress, irregular sleep","Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story, based on a press release, said the scientists discovered the gene. The researchers said they did not discover the gene but its link to breast cancer progression. This has been corrected.
MANILA, Philippines – A molecular biologist and her student from the University of the Philippines (UP) have discovered the link between a certain gene and breast cancer progression, which includes factors like stress and an irregular body clock.
Molecular biologist Dr. Pia Bagamasbad and her student, Weand Ybañez, of the UP Diliman National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, recently published an article in the journal Cancer Cell International about the function of a tumor-suppressor gene called Krüppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) in the growth and progression of breast cancer in women’s body.
In an interview with Rappler, Bagamasbad clarified that they did not discover KLF9 but rather its link and importance to breast cancer progression in relation to factors such as stress and irregular “light-dark cycle.”
A disrupted light-dark cycle occurs, for instance, among night shift workers and frequent international travelers.
In their study, the researchers found that KLF9 is downregulated in breast tumors compared to normal breast tissue.
The gene follows a 48-hour window of oscillation pattern in normal breast tissue. With stress hormones and the irregular light-dark cycle affecting the activity of the gene, it prevents the natural function of the gene to suppress tumor growth.
The disruption of the circadian cycle is an emerging driver of breast cancer, with epidemiological studies linking shift work and chronic jet lag to risk of the disease, according to the researchers.
In normal body function, the circadian cycle, which involves a regular 24-hour pattern of biological activity, is mainly controlled by the 12-hour light-dark cycle. This regulates several bodily functions, like the sleep-wake cycle, digestion, and the release and suppression of various hormones at certain times of the day.
“We call cancer a mistake of the genome. [It means that] multiple mistakes have to be made by a cell for cancer to develop. Stress alone is not a cause of cancer,” Bagamasbad pointed out, highlighting the significance of their study as a molecular basis in breast cancer development.
Night shift workers and frequent international travelers must be more attentive to their circadian rhythm since light controls the regularity of people’s bodily functions, including the appropriate timing of when cells divide and multiply, as well as the repair of cell damage to prevent cancer and other diseases. Bagamasbad explained the importance of the body’s natural interaction with day and night (the presence and absence of light or circadian rhythm) and the results of disruption contributing to cancer.
“Kailangan i-darken mo ‘yung paligid mo sa umaga when you’re sleeping. Shift your light and dark cycles din – artificial light sa gabi, artificial night din sa umaga,” she said.
(You need to darken your surroundings during the morning when you are sleeping. You also need to shift your light and dark cycles – if you have artificial light during the night, you also need artificial night during the day.)
Aside from the significance of hormonal balance in the body, maintaining the circadian cycle is necessary as the World Health Organization also acknowledged that its disruption is a risk factor for cancer.
While the gene is present in both men and women, they found that KLF9 antagonizes estrogen action. It means that while breast incidents in men are only less than 1%, trans women may increase their risk for breast cancer, although lower than cisgender women, due to the increase of estrogen in their bodies.
Since the samples collected for the study were only from cisgender women, Bagamasbad recognized the need for further study.
The results of the study could inform policy recommendations for the government’s and companies’ labor policies.
In the workplace, shifting schedules for a short period is not advisable for the body, according to Bagamasbad. While it is understandable that many employees work during the night, companies need to help their people establish regularity in their wake-sleep cycle for as long as possible instead of shifting schedules biweekly or monthly.
“Health should be a priority and should never be compromised, but nowadays, it’s really hard to balance healthy living habits and daily living norms,” said Lois Gaspar, who works the graveyard shift in the banking industry and lives with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).
With 4.5 million Filipino women living with PCOS, a hormonal imbalance problem for women, reducing stress and balancing their circadian rhythm are vital for their health.
At the national level, the government has a critical role in securing people’s health and rights. Currently, the Labor Code of the Philippines includes only at least 10% night differential pay for people working in the private sector between 10 pm and 6 am.
In April 2022, former president Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act 11701, which grants government employees a night differential pay not exceeding 20% of the hourly basic rate for any work performed between 6 pm and 6 am.
This night differential, however, is different from hazard pay, which is “an additional compensation for performing hazardous duties and for enduring physical hardships in the course of performance of duties,” as described by the Department of Budget and Management.
Hazard pay, while not mandatory in the country, is often limited to health workers and government uniformed personnel, and was only highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“They also deserve hazard pay because it’s a health risk, just like how we compensate our doctors, our firemen, and our policemen. They, too, are exposing themselves to unnecessary risk,” Bagamasbad said about night shift workers.
Bagamasbad and her team continue to work on understanding things at the molecular level, particularly other genes known as tumor suppressors.
“When the stressors in life are getting too much, we have to be proactive in making sure that we intervene,” she added.","Michelle Abad, Arby Paulyn Rae Duero","Mar 5, 2023 11:05 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/united-states-envoy-says-china-should-be-more-honest-covid-19-origins/,"China must be ‘more honest’ on COVID origins, envoy says","China must be more honest about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US ambassador to China said on Monday, February 27, after reports that the US Energy Department concluded the pandemic likely arose from a Chinese laboratory leak.
Nicholas Burns, speaking by video link at a US Chamber of Commerce event, said it was necessary to push China to take a more active role in the World Health Organization (WHO) if the UN health agency was to be strengthened.
China also needed to “be more honest about what happened three years ago in Wuhan with the origin of the COVID-19 crisis,” Burns said, referring to the central Chinese city where the first human cases were reported in December 2019.
The Wall Street Journal first reported on Sunday that the US Energy Department had concluded the pandemic likely arose from a Chinese laboratory leak, an assessment Beijing denies.
The department made its judgment with “low confidence” in a classified intelligence report recently provided to the White House and key members of Congress, the Journal said, citing people who had read the intelligence report.
Four other US agencies, along with a national intelligence panel, still judge that COVID-19 was likely the result of natural transmission, while two are undecided, the Journal reported.
The Energy Department did not respond to a request for comment.
President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sunday there were a “variety of views in the intelligence community” on the pandemic’s origins.
“A number of them have said they just don’t have enough information,” Sullivan told CNN.
Asked to comment on the report, which was confirmed by other US media, China’s foreign ministry referred to a WHO-China report that pointed toward a natural origin for the pandemic, likely from bats, rather than a lab leak.
“Certain parties should stop rehashing the ‘lab leak’ narrative, stop smearing China and stop politicizing the origins-tracing issue,” foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.
Burns told the Chamber event that it was a difficult moment for US-China relations, with Beijing seeking to deflect blame after the US military this month downed an alleged Chinese spy balloon that drifted across the continental United States.
“We’re now in this surreal moment where the Chinese, who I think lost the debate over the balloon globally, lost influence and credibility around the world because of what they’ve done – they’re now blaming this on us,” Burns said.
“It’s a little bit Orwellian. And it’s a little bit frustrating, because I think everybody knows the truth here.”
China reacted angrily when the US military downed the balloon on February 4, saying it was for monitoring weather conditions and had blown off course.
Burns added that it was the obligation of the United States to maintain its military strength “in and around Taiwan” to ensure the self-governed island claimed by Beijing has the ability to deter any kind of “offensive action” by China.
“It’s also … our responsibility to galvanize the rest of the world to make sure that the Chinese cannot get away with coercion or intimidation against Taiwan itself,” he said.",Reuters,"Feb 28, 2023 4:13 PM PHT"

In Europe, there is a marked decline in new COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths – the lowest levels observed in the European Union in the past twelve months, he said, citing data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
Still, the virus continues to evolve, and an organized approach is needed to maintain the range of vaccines to confer an adequate breadth of protection to emerging variants, he said.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/world-should-calm-down-about-china-covid-19-variants/,World should ‘calm down’ about China COVID-19 variants – Chinese scientist,"HONG KONG – The world should “calm down” about the possibility of new COVID-19 variants circulating in China, leading Chinese scientist George Gao said.
A paper by Gao and colleagues published in the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday, February 8,  showed that no new variants had emerged in the initial weeks of China’s recent outbreak, after the end of its zero-COVID policy saw a huge wave of cases.
“The world should completely calm down from the fear that there are new variants or special variants circulating (in China),” Gao, professor at the Institute of Microbiology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and former head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told Reuters.
The variants causing infections in China were the same Omicron sub-variants – BA.5.2 and BF.7 – seen elsewhere in the world, he said by email.
The study analyzed 413 new COVID cases in Beijing from November 14 to December 20, 2022 and found all were likely caused by existing strains. It found that 90% of the majority-locally acquired infections were due to the above two sub-variants.
The findings are representative of the entire country, the authors said, citing the characteristics of Beijing’s population and circulation of highly transmissible COVID strains.
China ended more than three years of a stringent zero-COVID policy involving city-wide lockdowns, mass testing and extensive quarantine in December, which was followed by a wave of infections across its 1.4 billion population.
A prominent government scientist said on January 21 that 80% of people had been infected already and China’s CDC has said repeatedly in the past month that continuous monitoring showed no new strains of COVID-19 have been found.
Many countries put in place COVID testing requirements for Chinese travellers in the wake of its large outbreak, citing concerns that new variants could emerge and a lack of data, though China has said the measures are not justified.
Gao said China was continuing widespread viral genomic sequencing, and would identify any new variants if they emerged.
He said cases were currently declining, but “a new wave is possible in the future.”
The Chinese-funded study in the Lancet was conducted by researchers from the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Chinese Academy of Sciences, CDC and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The authors said there were some limitations to the study, including China’s decision to end large-scale mandatory testing.
In the CDC’s latest release on Wednesday, it said that from September 26, 2022 to February 6, 2023, 23,217 local cases of the novel coronavirus genome valid sequences were reported nationwide, all of which were mutant strains of Omicron, with the main epidemic strains BA.5.2.48(53.0%), BF.7.14 (24.1%) and BA.5.2.49 (14.8%).
A total of 13 cases of variants were found, including 1 case of XBB.1, 5 cases of BQ.1.1, 1 case of BQ.1.1.17, 4 cases of BQ.1.2 and 2 cases of BQ.1.8.",Reuters,"Feb 9, 2023 10:14 PM PHT"

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/world-health-organization-investigation-cough-syrup-deaths/,"WHO investigating links between cough syrup deaths, considers advice for parents","The World Health Organization (WHO) is investigating whether there is any connection between manufacturers whose contaminated cough syrups it has linked to the deaths of more than 300 children in three countries, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Citing “unacceptable levels” of toxins in the products, the WHO is seeking more information about the specific raw materials used by six manufacturers in India and Indonesia to produce medicines linked to the recent deaths, as well as whether the companies obtained them from some of the same suppliers, the person said. The WHO has not named any suppliers.
The WHO also is considering whether to advise families globally to reassess the use of cough syrups for children in general while questions over the safety of some of these products are unresolved, the person said. WHO experts are evaluating the evidence for whether, or when, such products are medically necessary for children, the person said.
The deaths of children from acute kidney injury began in July 2022 in Gambia, followed by cases in Indonesia and Uzbekistan. The WHO has said the deaths are linked to over-the-counter cough syrups the children took for common illnesses and which contained a known toxin, either diethylene glycol or ethylene glycol.
To date, the WHO has identified six drugmakers in India and Indonesia who produced the syrups. These manufacturers have either declined to comment on the investigation or denied using contaminated materials that contributed to any deaths. Reuters has no evidence of wrongdoing by the companies the WHO has named.
“This is of the highest priority for us, to see no more child deaths from something that is so preventable,” WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris said, without commenting further on the details of the organization’s work.
The United Nations health agency said on Monday, January 23, it had widened its investigation into potential diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol contamination in cough syrups to four additional countries where the same products may have been on sale: Cambodia, the Philippines, East Timor, and Senegal. It called on other governments and the global pharmaceutical industry to launch urgent checks to root out substandard medicines and improve regulation.
The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that its members “are already doing what the WHO is calling for,” in line with national and international guidelines.
The WHO is expected to comment further on the cough syrup situation during a news conference later on Tuesday, January 24.
The WHO has already issued specific alerts for cough syrups made by two Indian manufacturers, Maiden Pharmaceuticals and Marion Biotech, in October 2022 and earlier this month. It said their syrups were linked to deaths in Gambia and Uzbekistan respectively, and the alerts asked people to stop using them.
Maiden and Marion’s manufacturing plants have both been shuttered. Maiden is now seeking to reopen after the Indian government said in December that its testing had found no problems with Maiden’s products.
Maiden has repeatedly told Reuters, including in December, that it did nothing wrong and Managing Director Naresh Kumar Goyal said on Tuesday he had no comment on WHO investigating possible connections between the companies under scrutiny.
Marion’s office phone went unanswered on Tuesday and the company did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Earlier this month, it told the government of Uttar Pradesh, where it is located near New Delhi, that it was being blamed for the deaths in Uzbekistan “to malign the image of India and the company”.
The WHO, working with Indonesia’s drugs regulator, also issued an alert in October about cough syrups made by four Indonesian manufacturers and sold domestically. The manufacturers are: PT Yarindo Farmatama, PT Universal Pharmaceutical, PT Konimex, PT AFI Farma.
PT Yarindo Farmatama, PT Konimex and PT AFI Farma did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday about the WHO investigating connections between the deaths in the three countries.
PT Universal Pharmaceutical Industries’ lawyer, Hermansyah Hutagalung, said it had pulled from the market all cough syrups deemed dangerous. “Chase the suppliers, they’re the real criminals,” Hutagalung added. “They’re the ones that forge raw ingredients by falsifying raw ingredient documents all the way to pharmaceutical companies.” He did not identify specific suppliers or give details to back up the claim.
The WHO said the syrups were contaminated with diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol, which it called “ toxic chemicals used as industrial solvents and antifreeze agents that can be fatal even taken in small amounts.” Their toxic effects include an inability to pass urine, kidney injury and death.
The deaths have highlighted potential gaps in global regulation of commonly-used medications, including oversight of factories and supply chains, particularly those producing products for developing countries which lack the resources to monitor medicines for safety.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Friday, January 13, that a CDC vaccine database had uncovered a possible safety issue in which people 65 and older were more likely to have an ischemic stroke 21 days after receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech bivalent shot, compared with days 22 to 44.
An ischemic stroke, also known as brain ischemia, is caused by blockages in arteries that carry blood to the brain.
The FDA and CDC said that other large studies, the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, other countries’ databases and Pfizer-BioNTech’s databases had not flagged this safety issue, adding that it requires more investigation.
“Although the totality of the data currently suggests that it is very unlikely that the signal in VSD (Vaccine Safety Datalink) represents a true clinical risk, we believe it is important to share this information with the public,” the health authorities said.
Pfizer and BioNTech said in a statement that they have been made aware of limited reports of ischemic strokes in people 65 and older following vaccination with their updated shot.
“Neither Pfizer and BioNTech nor the CDC or FDA have observed similar findings across numerous other monitoring systems in the US and globally and there is no evidence to conclude that ischemic stroke is associated with the use of the companies’ COVID-19 vaccines,” the companies added.

https://www.rappler.com/world/africa/uganda-declares-ebola-free-after-swiftly-turning-tide-outbreak/,Uganda declares itself Ebola-free after swiftly turning tide on outbreak,"KAMPALA, Uganda  – Uganda on Wednesday, January 11, declared the end of a nearly four-month Ebola outbreak that it briefly struggled to contain but was then able to swiftly bring under control despite the absence of a proven vaccine against the viral strain in question.
“We have successfully controlled the spread of Ebola in Uganda,” Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng said during a ceremony to mark the outbreak’s end.
Aceng said this was Uganda’s eighth Ebola outbreak since 2000, when the country recorded its first and most deadly one that killed more than half of the 425 people it infected.
The latest outbreak killed 55 of the 143 people infected since September, according to health ministry figures. Six of the fatalities were health workers.
Wednesday’s declaration followed Uganda’s completion of 42 days with no active cases, which represents two full incubation periods of the virus.
In the early weeks of the outbreak, cases spread beyond the epicenter of Mubende, 150 km (90 miles) west of the capital Kampala, to several other districts, including Kampala.
The director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, praised Uganda for its response to the virus.
“Uganda has shown that Ebola can be defeated when the whole system works together, from having an alert system in place, to finding and caring for people affected and their contacts, to gaining the full participation of affected communities in the response,” he said in a statement.
Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni said a two-week delay in declaring the outbreak after the first probable death from Ebola meant “the opportunity for immediate quarantine of contacts was lost”.
But health officials were able to turn the tide on the disease by November after imposing a lockdown on affected districts.
Ebola spreads through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person and has a fatality rate of about 50%. More than 11,300 people died during the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa.
Unlike the more common strain of the virus, Ebola Zaire, which has been behind several recent epidemics in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, the strain behind Uganda’s outbreak, Ebola Sudan, has no proven vaccine.
Even so, experts said Uganda’s experience battling previous outbreaks of Ebola and its viral cousin Marburg helped its response.
Uganda’s speed in ultimately containing cases, however, meant planned trials of vaccine candidates never got off the ground.
In December, Uganda received three vaccines one by the University of Oxford and Serum Institute ofIndia, another by the Sabin Vaccine Institute and a third by Merck – for use vaccinating people in contact with confirmed cases.
But by that point, there were no new cases. The WHO said experts would meet on January 12 to discuss the next steps for the vaccines.
Sabin chief executive Amy Finan said preparing for the trials had nevertheless taught health officials lessons for rolling out a trial in the future, including how to engage with  communities.

Here is what we know so far:
The World Health Organization’s senior epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said XBB.1.5 is the most transmissible Omicron sub-variant that has been detected so far. It spreads rapidly because of the mutations it contains, allowing it to adhere to cells and replicate easily.
“Our concern is how transmissible it is,” Van Kerkhove said in a news briefing on Wednesday, January 4, XBB and XBB.1.5 were estimated to account for 44.1% of COVID-19 cases in the United States in the week of December 31, up from 25.9% in the previous week, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It has also been detected in 28 other countries worldwide, the WHO said.
XBB.1.5 is yet another descendant of Omicron, the most contagious variant of the virus causing COVID-19 that is now globally dominant. It is an offshoot of XBB, first detected in October, which is itself a recombinant of two other Omicron sub-variants.
The WHO said it does not have any data on severity yet, or a clinical picture on its impact. It said that it saw no indication that its severity had changed but that increased transmissibility is always a concern.
“We do expect further waves of infection around the world, but that doesn’t have to translate into further waves of death because our countermeasures continue to work,” said Van Kerkhove, referring to vaccines and treatments.
She said the WHO was unable to currently attribute the increase in hospitalizations in the northeastern United States to the variant, given that many other respiratory viruses were also in circulation.
Virologists agree that the emergence of the new subvariant does not mean there is a new crisis in the pandemic. New variants are to be expected as the virus continues to spread.
XBB.1.5 is likely to spread globally, but it remains unclear if it will cause its own wave of infections around the world. Current vaccines continue to protect against severe symptoms, hospitalization and death, the experts say.
“There is no reason to think that XBB.1.5 is of any more concern than other variants that come and go in the ever-changing landscape of COVID-19 mutants,” said Professor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group.
The WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution is doing a risk assessment on the subvariant. Van Kerkhove said on Wednesday it hoped to publish that in the next few days.
Professor Tulio de Oliveira, a South African scientist who sits on the committee, said the situation was “complex,” particularly given the global context of the surge of cases in China after it dropped its zero-COVID policy in December.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/world-health-organization-advisers-call-realistic-covid-data-from-china/,Leading WHO advisers call for ‘realistic’ COVID data from China at key meeting,"LONDON, United Kingdom  – Leading scientists advising the World Health Organization said they wanted a “more realistic picture” about the COVID-19 situation from China’s top experts at a key meeting on Tuesday, January 3, as worries grow about the rapid spread of the virus.
The WHO has invited Chinese scientists to a virtual closed meeting with its technical advisory group on viral evolution on Tuesday, to present data on which variants are circulating in the country. It is not open to the public or media.
China lifted its “zero-COVID” measures in December 2022. COVID cases are now surging, although official data is patchy.
“We want to see a more realistic picture of what is actually going on,” said Professor Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist who sits on the WHO committee. Speaking to Reuters ahead of the meeting, she said some of the data from China, such as hospitalization numbers, is “not very credible”.
“It is in the interests of China itself to come forward with more reliable information.”
Professor Tulio de Oliveira, a South African scientist who also sits on the committee and whose team has detected a number of new variants, said “of course” it would be good to get more information from China, but this also applies globally.
So far, sequencing data from China provided to the online GISAID hub has shown the variants circulating there are offshoots of Omicron, in line with the dominant variants in the rest of the world.
Koopmans and colleagues expect to discuss similar information at the WHO meeting on Tuesday, with scientists from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
The group meeting is an international committee of experts which has gathered throughout the pandemic, and regularly receives briefings from countries experiencing large waves of infection or new variants.
Koopmans said they have only seen a “tiny fraction” of China’s cases sequenced so far – around 700 – and called for the establishment of a global surveillance network to keep track of SARS-CoV-2.
“Right now, what we are getting is very patchy, but that has been the reality in other parts of the world as well,” she said.
Last month, Reuters reported that the WHO had not received data from China on new COVID hospitalizations since Beijing lifted its zero-COVID policy, prompting some health experts toquestion whether it might be hiding information on the extent of its outbreak.
De Oliveira criticized the imposition of travel restrictions by several countries on China, something South Africa experienced after alerting the world to the Beta and Omicron variants.
“One thing we should do three years into the pandemic is learn from our mistakes … To encourage a country to share more data, the best way is to support them and not discriminate against them with restrictions curbing travel,” he said.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/new-covid-19-model-predicts-over-million-deaths-china-2023/,New COVID-19 model predicts over 1 million deaths in China through 2023,"CHICAGO, USA – China’s abrupt lifting of stringent COVID-19 restrictions could result in an explosion of cases and over a million deaths through 2023, according to new projections from the US-based Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).
According to the group’s projections, cases in China would peak around April 1, when deaths would reach 322,000. About a third of China’s population will have been infected by then, IHME Director Christopher Murray said.
China’s national health authority has not reported any official COVID-19 deaths since the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. The last official deaths were reported on December 3.
Total pandemic fatalities stand at 5,235.
China lifted some of the world’s toughest COVID-19 restrictions in December after unprecedented public protests and is now experiencing a spike in infections, with fears COVID-19 could sweep across its 1.4 billion population during next month’s Lunar New Year holiday.
“Nobody thought they would stick to zero-COVID as long as they did,” Murray said on Friday, December 16, when the IHME projections were released online.
China’s zero-COVID policy may have been effective at keeping earlier variants of the virus at bay, but the high transmissibility of Omicron variants made it impossible to sustain, he said.
The independent modeling group at the University of Washington in Seattle, which has been relied on by governments and companies throughout the pandemic, drew on provincial data and information from a recent Omicron outbreak in Hong Kong.
“China has since the original Wuhan outbreak barely reported any deaths. That is why we looked to Hong Kong to get an idea of the infection fatality rate,” Murray said.
For its forecasts, IHME also uses information on vaccination rates provided by the Chinese government as well as assumptions on how various provinces will respond as infection rates increase.
Other experts expect some 60% of China’s population will eventually be infected, with a peak expected in January, hitting vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, the hardest.
Key concerns include China’s large pool of susceptible individuals, the use of less effective vaccines and low vaccine coverage among those 80 and older, who are at greatest risk of severe disease.
Disease modelers at the University of Hong Kong predict that lifting COVID-19 restrictions and simultaneously reopening all provinces in December 2022 through January 2023 would result in 684 deaths per million people during that timeframe, according to a paper released on Wednesday on the Medrxiv preprint server that has yet to undergo peer review.
Based on China’s population of 1.41 billion, and without measures such as a mass vaccination booster campaign, that amounts to 964,400 deaths.
Another study published July 2022 in Nature Medicine by researchers at the School of Public Health at Fudan University in Shanghai predicted an Omicron wave absent restrictions would result in 1.55 million deaths over a six-month period, and peak demand for intensive care units of 15.6 times higher than existing capacity.
Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said there are 164 million people in China with diabetes, a risk factor for poor COVID-19 outcomes. There are also 8 million people aged 80 and older who have never been vaccinated.
Chinese officials are now encouraging individuals to get boosted from a list of newer Chinese-made shots, however, the government is still reluctant to use foreign vaccines, Huang said.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/who-low-global-stockpile-cholera-vaccines/,"We’ve run out of cholera vaccines, WHO official says as disease surges","GENEVA, Switzerland – The global stockpile of cholera vaccines the World Health Organization helps manage is “currently empty or extremely low,” a WHO official said on Friday, December 16, amid a resurgence of the disease around the world.
The UN health agency says global fatality rates are rising and there are around 30 countries around the world that have reported cholera outbreaks this year, about a third higher than in a typical year.
“We have no more vaccines. More countries are continuing to request (them) and it’s extremely challenging,” said Dr. Philippe Barboza, WHO team lead for cholera and epidemic diarrheal diseases.
He was referring to an emergency stockpile held by the International Coordinating Group on vaccine provision that is managed by the WHO and other partners. Typically, it has about 36 million doses available a year. The shortage of vaccines has already prompted the WHO to temporarily suspend the standard two-dose vaccination strategy in October.
Barboza said part of the crunch was due to the decision by an Indian manufacturer to halt exports, without giving details. He said a South African manufacturer was planning to start production but it would take “a few years.”
“It’s probably far less attractive to develop a vaccine for cholera, so basically a vaccine for poor countries, than to develop COVID vaccines where the income made for the vaccine is much higher,” he said. A batch of more than 1 million doses arrived in Haiti this week.
Cholera is spread by contaminated food or water and can cause acute diarrhea. Many people have mild symptoms but it can kill within hours if untreated.
“It is not acceptable in the 21st century to have people dying of a disease which is very well known and very easy to treat,” Barboza added.
Among the countries with outbreaks are those affected by poverty and conflict such as Haiti and Yemen but the disease has also been reported in countries like Lebanon which until recently was a middle-income country, saying this should be a “wake-up” call for other countries.",Reuters,"Dec 16, 2022 7:48 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-some-bloodstream-infection-bacteria-resistant-last-resort-drugs-2020/,Some bloodstream infection bacteria grew resistant to last-resort drugs in 2020 – WHO,"LONDON, United Kingdom – Increased drug resistance in bacteria causing bloodstream infections, including against last-resort antibiotics, was seen in the first year of the coronavirus pandemic, a World Health Organization report based on data from 87 countries in 2020 showed.
The overuse and/or misuse of antibiotics has helped microbes to become resistant to many treatments, while the pipeline of replacement therapies in development is alarmingly sparse.
High levels (above 50%) of resistance have been reported in bacteria that typically cause life-threatening bloodstream infections in hospitals such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter spp, report authors highlighted on Friday, December 9.
These infections often require treatment with “last-resort” antibiotics, drugs that are used when all other antibiotics fail.
About 8% of bloodstream infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae grew resistant to a vital last-resort group of drugs called carbapenems, the report said.
Rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remain very high, but last-resort antibiotics are only just starting to lose potency, said Dr Carmem Pessoa-Silva, the lead for WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System, in a media conference.
The message of hope, she said is, “we have a very narrow window of opportunity…for responding to the threat.”
While there is a concerted push to limit the unbridled use of antibiotics, the pace of new research remains grim.
The effort, cost and time it takes to get an antibiotic approved and the limited return on investment have deterred drugmakers, as treatments must be priced cheaply and are designed to be used as little as possible to limit drug resistance.
As a result, the lion’s share of antibiotic development is taking place in a handful of labs of small biopharma companies as a majority of their larger counterparts focus on more lucrative markets.
Only a few big pharmaceutical companies remain in the space – including GSK and Merck – down from more than 20 in the 1980s.
A landmark global analysis published earlier this year found that 1.2 million people died in 2019 due to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, making AMR a leading cause of death worldwide, higher than HIV/AIDS or malaria.
“Political commitment (on AMR) must now urgently move from aspiration into action,” said Thomas Cueni, director general at International Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations.
The authors of the WHO report said more research is needed to identify the reasons behind the jump in AMR in the period studied, and to what extent it is linked to the accelerated use of antibiotics during the pandemic.
AMR rates also remain difficult to interpret due to insufficient testing and weak laboratory capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, the authors wrote.",Reuters,"Dec 9, 2022 6:10 PM PHT"

The comments by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus mark a change in tone just months after he said that the world has never been in a better position to end the pandemic.
“We are much closer to being able to say that the emergency phase of the pandemic is over, but we’re not there yet,” Tedros said on Friday.
The global health agency estimates that about 90% of the world’s population now has some level of immunity to SARS-COV-2 either due to prior infection or vaccination.
“Gaps in testing…. and vaccination are continuing to create the perfect conditions for a new variant of concern to emerge that could cause significant mortality,” Tedros said.
COVID-19 infections are at record highs in China and have started to rise in parts of Britain after months of decline.
Further easing of COVID-19 testing requirements and quarantine rules in some Chinese cities was met with a mix of relief and worry on Friday, as hundreds of millions await an expected shift in national virus policies after widespread social unrest.
“While COVID-19 and flu can be mild infections for many, we must not forget that they can cause severe illness or even death for those most vulnerable in our communities”, Mary Ramsay, director of public health programs at the UK Health Security Agency, said.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/alzheimers-drug-eisai-biogen-slows-cognitive-decline-side-effects-focus/,"Alzheimer’s drug from Eisai and Biogen slows cognitive decline, side-effects in focus","SAN FRANCISCO, USA – An experimental Alzheimer’s disease drug from Eisai and Biogen slowed cognitive decline in a closely watched trial but may carry a risk of dangerous side effects for certain patients, according to new data presented on Tuesday, November 29.
The drug, lecanemab, was associated with a type of brain swelling in 12.6% of trial patients, a side effect previously seen with similar drugs. Fourteen percent of patients had microhemorrhages in the brain – a symptom linked to two recent deaths of people receiving lecanemab in a follow-on study – and five patients suffered macrohemorrhages.
The companies said in September that the 18-month trial, which enrolled nearly 1,800 participants with early-stage Alzheimer’s, found that treatment with lecanemab reduced the rate of decline on a clinical dementia scale (CDR-SB) by 27% compared to a placebo.
“All of these amyloid-lowering drugs carry a risk for increased brain hemorrhage,” said Dr. Ronald Petersen of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “I think the primary outcomes, the secondary outcomes, the amyloid-lowering is pretty impressive.”
The Alzheimer’s Association said the data confirms the drug “can meaningfully change the course of the disease for people in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease,” and called on US regulators to approve the company’s application for accelerated approval.
Eisai shares climbed 3% Tokyo Wednesday morning while Biogen shares were 0.9% higher in after-hours trade. They have jumped some 60% and 47% respectively since the announcement of the trial’s initial findings in late September.
The trial showed no benefit on the CDR-SB measure for some patients with a genetic risk of developing the mind-wasting disease.
About 16% of participants had two copies (homozygous) of the APOE4 gene variant known to raise the risk of developing Alzheimer’s, 53% had one copy of the gene (heterozygous), and 31% were noncarriers.
“For that small group of homozygous patients, when it comes to CDR-SB we don’t see a signal favoring lecanemab,” Ivan Cheung, Eisai’s U.S. chairman, said in an interview. He suggested that could be because homozygous study patients who were given a placebo fared better than expected.
The APOE4 carriers did show improvement on the trial’s secondary goals, including other measures of cognition and daily function. Overall, lecanemab patients benefited by 23% to 37% compared with a placebo on these secondary trial goals.
“I believe it’s an important benefit that will justify full approval. But of course, we want a bigger benefit,” said Dr. Paul Aisen, director of the University of Southern California Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute and a co-author of the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. He said lecanemab is likely to provide greater benefit if given earlier in the disease, “before you’ve accumulated enough irreversible damage to be causing symptoms.”
Detailed data from the study were presented at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease meeting in San Francisco.
Eisai believes the trial results prove a longstanding theory that removal of sticky deposits of a protein called amyloid beta from the brains of people with early Alzheimer’s can delay its advance.
At 18 months, 68% of trial participants treated with lecanemab had amyloid clearance, Eisai said.
Two deaths – both from brain hemorrhages – have been reported among participants in a trial extension – a 65-year-old woman who received a type of medicine known as tissue plasminogen activator to clear blood clots after suffering a stroke and an 87-year-old who was on the blood thinner Eliquis.
Eisai said it believes the two deaths “cannot be attributed to lecanemab.”
Cheung said Eisai has protocols in place for monitoring brain swelling and sees no need for restrictions on which patients might be eligible for lecanemab treatment.
Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer at the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, said doctors always balance the benefits and risks of therapies. “Currently, I would hesitate to give this drug to someone on blood thinners,” he said.
The US Food and Drug Administration is slated to decide by Jan. 6 whether to approve lecanemab under its “accelerated” review program, which requires proof that a drug can impact a biomarker associated with a disease, such as reduction of amyloid beta in the brain.
Regardless of that decision, Cheung said Eisai plans to soon file for standard FDA approval of the drug and will also seek approval in Europe and Japan.",Reuters,"Nov 30, 2022 11:56 AM PHT"

The company cited Gavi’s failure to procure the 350 million doses it had agreed to buy in May last year for the COVAX facility.
The COVAX facility is a joint program between Gavi, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations for the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in poorer countries.
The termination has not resulted in any penalties, the company said.
Novavax received a non-refundable advance payment of $350 million from Gavi last year and an additional $350 million this year after the vaccine got the WHO’s emergency use listing, the company said.
Novavax also has a pact with Serum Institute of India for manufacturing a version of the vaccine under the brand Covovax, which would also be supplied to the COVAX facility.
Serum Institute was expected to manufacture and sell around 750 million doses of Covovax to the facility.
Novavax and Serum Institute were not immediately available to respond on whether that deal was also terminated.
The announcement comes on the back of poor demand for the company’s shot amid a global supply glut for COVID-19 vaccines and waning demand.
The company had earlier this month cut its full-year forecast yet again, hurt by late authorizations of its vaccine globally. Covovax and Serum’s vaccines were the ninth and tenth vaccine, respectively, to get the WHO’s emergency listing.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/roche-alzheimers-drug-fails-meet-trial-goal/,Roche’s Alzheimer’s drug fails to meet goal in long awaited trial,"Roche said its Alzheimer’s drug candidate could not clearly be shown to slow dementia progression in two drug trials, failing to draw level with a recent development success by rivals Biogen and Eisai.
The Swiss drugmaker said in a statement on Monday, November 14, that twin studies known as Graduate 1 and 2 had not reached the primary goal of showing that the drug gantenerumab could preserve abilities such as remembering, solving problems, orientation and personal care in patients suffering from early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.
Roche conducted two identically designed studies, each with about 1,000 participants, who were examined and queried by physicians over more than two years. Within each study, volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either the injectable antibody drug gantenerumab or a placebo.
The drug was associated with a relative reduction in clinical decline of 8% in Graduate 1 and 6% in Graduate 2 compared with the placebo, but those results were not statistically reliable, the company said in a statement.
Gantenerumab was designed to bind to aggregated forms of beta-amyloid and remove brain amyloid plaques, which are believed to play a crucial role in the slowly progressing dementia disease.
The setback will be an added challenge for CEO-designate Thomas Schinecker, Roche’s head of diagnostics, who will be promoted in March, replacing CEO Severin Schwan, who led a successful campaign to diversify away from Roche’s traditional focus on cancer.
The quest to develop an Alzheimer’s drug, targeting beta-amyloid or other molecules, has been beset by a long list of study failures.
But rival Biogen in September scored a surprise trial success with an experimental Alzheimer’s drug that it developed with Eisai, rebuilding confidence among industry executives and researchers in the beta-amyloid approach.
Biogen and Eisai said at the time their drug candidate lecanemab had slowed progression of the brain-wasting disease by 27% compared with a placebo in a large trial of patients in the early stages of Alzheimer’s.
Most of the 55 million people suffering from dementia worldwide are believed to be affected by Alzheimer’s disease, according to the World Health Organization. In 2030, dementia is expected to affect 78 million.
Alzheimer’s is difficult to diagnose, especially during its early stages.
Berenberg analysts have put a 50% probability on Roche achieving 10 billion Swiss francs in peak annual gantenerumab sales. Other analysts have not included the drug candidate in their group revenue estimates, due to uncertainty.
Germany’s Morphosys would have received tiered royalties of about 2% to 3% on future gantenerumab sales from its early role in developing the drug. Royalty Pharma would have been entitled to about 3% to 4% of gantenerumab sales under a 2021 deal with Morphosys.
Analysts have said the read-out from the trial would impact stock market confidence in Roche’s development prowess, especially after lung cancer immunotherapy hopeful tiragolumab fell through in trials earlier this year, battering the company’s shares.
Schwan earlier this year sought to curb expectations for the Graduate trials but the head of Roche’s pharma unit last month acknowledged that Biogen’s success with lecanemab had reignited hopes.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/monkeypox-transmission-happens-before-symptoms-study/,"‘Considerable’ monkeypox transmission happens before symptoms, study suggests","LONDON, United Kingdom – Monkeypox can spread before symptoms appear, British researchers said on Wednesday, November 2, providing the first evidence indicating the virus can be transmitted this way.
It was previously thought that monkeypox was almost entirely spread by people who were already sick, although pre-symptomatic transmission had not been ruled out and some routine screening had picked up cases without symptoms.
Monkeypox, a relatively mild viral illness that is endemic in several countries in western and central Africa, exploded around the world earlier this year, with outbreaks in dozens of countries where it had never previously appeared.
There have been almost 78,000 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although cases have peaked in many countries, this week the World Health Organization said the outbreak still represented a global health emergency.
The virus is known to spread through close contact and causes symptoms including fever, body aches and often painful pus-filled skin lesions.
To find out more about how monkeypox was transmitting in Britain, a team from the UK Health Security Agency used routine surveillance and contact tracing data for 2,746 people in the country who tested positive between May and August.
Their average age was 38, and 95% of the patients reported being gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men.
Researchers analysed the “serial interval” – the time from when symptoms began in the first case to when they began in a connected case – as well as the incubation period, the typical time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms.
Using two statistical models, they found that the median serial interval was shorter than the median incubation period. This indicated that “considerable” transmission happened before the appearance or detection of symptoms has taken place, the researchers wrote in the paper published in the British Medical Journal.
Four days was the longest period before symptoms began that transmission was detected, and the team said up to 53% of transmission may have taken place before symptoms began.
The study raises questions over tackling monkeypox worldwide, including whether asking people to isolate when symptoms appear is enough to stop the virus spreading.
Many richer countries have vaccinated high-risk populations to curb the outbreak, but shots are limited and there are none available in Africa.
Independent experts said the findings could have important implications for global infection control, if supported by other studies.
“These are urgent questions that need answers,” said Boghuma Kabisen Titanji, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University, Atlanta.
Other scientists said the work was robust but needed clinical data before it could be labeled definitive or applied globally.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/china-rolls-out-first-inhalable-covid-19-vaccine/,China rolls out first inhalable COVID-19 vaccine,"SHANGHAI, China – In what is believed to be a world first, China’s commercial capital of Shanghai this week introduced a new type of COVID-19 vaccine that is inhaled rather than administered via injection.
Chinese regulators approved the vaccine, produced by Chinese pharmaceutical firm CanSino Biologics, for use as a booster in September.
And now the first people are starting to receive the vaccine, which is inhaled via the mouth from a vessel that looks like a take-out coffee cup with a short mouthpiece.
“Our body’s first line of defense is the mucus membrane of our respiratory system, we want that to be directly stimulated to improve immunity and using the inhaled vaccine does that,” Dr Zhao Hui, chief medical officer at Shanghai United Family Hospital Pudong, told Reuters.
His hospital is among those administering the new vaccine, which will be used as well as regular injected shots.
Commenting on what he said was a first use of the technology, Erwin Loh, chief medical officer at St Vincents Health Australia, said the advent of inhaled vaccines was important not only because of their potential to guard against infection, but also because they could lessen vaccine hesitancy.
“There is a large proportion of people who are resistant to take the vaccine because they have a needle phobia. They may not articulate it, but that’s what in their mind,” he said.
Increasing the uptake in vaccinations is vital for China, which remains a global outlier as it sticks to its “zero-COVID” policy, aiming to eliminate community outbreaks of the virus.
Shanghai, which reported no new domestically transmitted symptomatic coronavirus cases for October 27 and 11 local asymptomatic cases, is still subject to targeted lockdowns impacting residential buildings and businesses in the city.
The Shanghai government’s WeChat account, in announcing the inhalable vaccine rollout this week, said that 23 million of the city’s 26 million residents had been fully vaccinated against COVID, and more than 12 million had received booster shots.
According to official Chinese government data, more than 90% of its population has been vaccinated. The country has relied on domestically produced, inactivated shots and has yet to import, or introduce its own version, of an mRNA vaccine. The inhalable vaccine is an aerosol version of an inactive shot.
Loh is hopeful that results from Shanghai’s foray into inhaled vaccines will encourage other countries to follow suit.

Global efforts to tackle deadly diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic. The health crisis has particularly hit the response to TB and led countries to fall behind in meeting targets to curb the infectious disease.
WHO urged the world to apply lessons learnt from the pandemic to tuberculosis, which severely affects countries such as India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan.
“If the pandemic has taught us anything, it’s that with solidarity, determination, innovation and the equitable use of tools, we can overcome severe health threats,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
WHO’s annual TB report estimates that tuberculosis killed 1.6 million people in 2021, above the estimated 1.5 million deaths in 2020, and 1.4 million deaths in 2019. Deaths related to tuberculosis had fallen between 2005 and 2019.
The report also warns that in the near future TB could replace COVID-19 to become the leading cause of death worldwide from a single infectious agent.
A recent report from Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria shows that while the number of people reached with treatment and prevention efforts rebounded last year, the world is still not on track to defeat these killer diseases.
About 10.6 million people were infected with tuberculosis in 2021, an increase of 4.5% from 2020, according to the WHO report.
Under its “End TB Strategy,” the WHO set a target of reducing TB deaths by 35% from 2015 to 2020, but the net reduction was 5.9% between 2015 and 2021.",Reuters,"Oct 27, 2022 11:39 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/africa/world-health-organization-concerned-ebola-spread-latest-cases-not-contacts-infected/,WHO ‘concerned’ about Ebola spread as latest 8 cases not contacts of others infected,"LONDON, United Kingdom – The eight most recent Ebola cases reported during the outbreak in Uganda have no known links with current patients, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday, October 19, raising concerns over the spread of the deadly disease.
In a briefing, the WHO said initial investigations into the cases by Uganda’s Ministry of Health had shown they were not contacts of people already known to have Ebola.
“We remain concerned that there may be more chains of transmission and more contacts than we know about in the affected communities,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.
There have been 60 confirmed and 20 probable cases since the outbreak began last month, and 44 deaths, the WHO said.
The strain spreading in Uganda is the Sudan strain, and the existing vaccines and therapies do not work against it.
However, the Ugandan government is collaborating with WHO to set up a trial of two vaccines in the early stages of development which do target the Sudan strain – one developed by Oxford University and the Serum Institute, and one made by the Sabin Institute in the United States, WHO confirmed.

The number of young Filipinos who often felt loneliness, sadness, and being disliked by other people almost doubled between 2013 and 2021, the study found.
About 10,949 randomly selected youth aged 15 to 24 from over 900 randomly selected barangays in the country participated in the comprehensive 2021 study.
The study pegs the number of Filipino youth who said they attempted ending their life in 2013 at 574,000 or 3%. In 2021, that number increased to 7.5%, or about 1.5 million youth.
According to the study, about six in 10 youth who experienced symptoms of depression did not reach out to anyone for help.
Of those who did seek help, even fewer went to professionals for help.
Most Filipino youth sought help from close friends or peers, about 25% of those who considered ending their life. This was followed by parents/guardians at 7%, and other relatives at 5%.
According to UPPI’s study, only one in 10 are aware of any suicide prevention program or service.
“Incidentally, data collection for YAFS5 was conducted in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, whereby physical and social isolation may have gravely affected young people’s disposition,” UPPI said in a statement.
“These alarming findings indicate that today’s youth have poorer mental well-being than in the last few decades. The reasons for this are many and complex, but as it is, multiple challenges, including severe understaffing, the cost of consultation and treatment, and the stigmatization  of mental health problems confront mental healthcare in the country,” they added.In the beginning part of the pandemic from 2020 to 2021, many students had already been taking classes remotely in prolonged periods of isolation and were subject to strict curfews.
While mental health among youth may have declined, the same study found that fewer of them were turning to drinking or smoking in 2021. With regard to sexual health, HIV/AIDS awareness dropped.

RSV is a leading cause of pneumonia in toddlers and the elderly, causing thousands of hospitalizations and deaths each year, but the complex molecular structure of the virus and safety concerns have stymied efforts to develop a vaccine since it was first discovered in 1956.
The trial, which involved roughly 25,000 adults aged 60 and over, tested a single dose of the experimental vaccine against a placebo.
Vaccine efficacy against severe lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) associated with an RSV infection was 94.1%, the British drugmaker said.
“These are truly exceptional results given that today RSV remains one of the major infectious diseases without a vaccine, despite over 60 years of research,” said Tony Wood, GSK Chief Scientific Officer, in a statement.
GSK is a key player in the race to develop a safe and effective RSV vaccine, which, if approved, is expected to generate billions in sales for its maker.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/nobel-medicine-prize-2022-explorer-ancient-dna/,Nobel medicine prize goes to explorer of ancient DNA,"Swedish geneticist Svante Paabo won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday, October 3, for discoveries that underpin our understanding of how modern day humans evolved from extinct ancestors.
Paabo, director at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, won the prize for “discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution,” the Award committee said.
Paabo was “overwhelmed” and “very happy”, said Thomas Perlmann, secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, after calling the scientist with the news.
Paabo, 67, said he thought the call from Sweden was something to do his summer house there.
“So I was just gulping down the last cup of tea to go and pick up my daughter at her nanny where she has had an overnight stay,” Paabo said in a audio recording posted on the Nobel website.
“And then I got this call from Sweden and I of course thought it had something to do with our little summer house in Sweden … I thought the lawn mower had broken down or something.”
Asked if he thought he would get the award, he said: “No, I have received a couple of prizes before but I somehow did not think that this really would qualify for a Nobel Prize.”
Paabo, son of a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist, has been credited with transforming the study of human origins after developing ways to allow for the examination of DNA sequences from archaeological and paleontological remains reaching back to the dawn of human history.
Not only did he help uncover the existence of a previously unknown human species called the Denisovans, from a 40,000-year-old fragment of a finger bone discovered in Siberia, his crowning achievement is considered to be the methods developed to allow for the sequencing of an entire Neanderthal genome.
This research, which showed that certain genes of Neanderthal origin are preserved in the genomes of people today, was once considered impossible, given that Neanderthal DNA on bones has shriveled up over thousands of years into short fragments that have to be assembled like a gigantic puzzle, and are also heavily contaminated with microbial DNA.
“This ancient flow of genes to present-day humans has physiological relevance today, for example affecting how our immune system reacts to infections,” the Nobel Committee said in a statement on Monday.
The prize, among the most prestigious in the scientific world, is awarded by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden’s Karolinska Institute and is worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($900,357).
It is the first of this year’s batch of prizes.
Born in Stockholm, Paabo studied medicine and biochemistry at Uppsala University before creating a scientific discipline called “paleogenomics”, which helped shed light on the genetic differences that distinguish living humans from extinct hominins.
“His discoveries provide the basis for exploring what makes us uniquely human,” the Committee said.
“A scientist who helps us to better understand our own species – and is rightly recognized for it today,” German education and research Minister Bettina Stark-Watzinger tweeted on Monday.
Created in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and wealthy businessman Alfred Nobel, the prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace have been awarded since 1901, though the economics prize is a later addition.
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed medical research center stage with many expecting that the development of the vaccines that have allowed the world to regain some sense of normality may eventually be rewarded.
Still, it typically takes many years for any given research to be honored, with the committees charged with picking the winners looking to determine its full value with some certainty amongst what is always a packed field of contenders.
When asked why the prize was not awarded to advances in combating COVID, Perlmann said it was a good question he was not going to answer.
“We only talk about people who are getting the Nobel Prize and not those who are not receiving or not received them yet.”
However, Paabo’s ancient forensics work did offer insight on why some people are at higher risk of severe COVID.
In 2020, a report from Paabo and colleagues found that a gene variant inherited by modern humans from Neanderthals when they interbred some 60,000 years ago, made those that carry the variant more likely to require artificial ventilation if infected by the COVID-causing virus.
“We can make an average gauge of the number of the extra deaths we have had in the pandemic due to the contribution from the Neanderthals. It is quite substantial, it’s more than one million extra individuals who have died due to this Neanderthal variant that they carry,” Paabo said in 2022 lecture.
Paabo’s most cited paper in the Web of Science was published in 1989, with 4,077 citations, said David Pendlebury, from UK-based scientific data analytics provider Clarivate.
“Only some 2,000 papers out of 55 million published since 1970 have been cited this many times,” he said.
Clearly the Nobel Assembly decided this revolutionary research in genetics and evolution fell within the range of topics that should be recognized, he added.
“It is, however, not an award for a discovery relevant to clinical medicine, which many anticipated this year after a Nobel Prize focusing on physiology last year.”
Past winners in the field include a string of famous researchers, notably Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 prize for the discovery of penicillin, and Robert Koch, who won already in 1905 for his investigations of tuberculosis.",Reuters,"Oct 3, 2022 9:17 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-strong-advice-against-covid-treatments-sotrovimab-casirivimab-imdevimab/,WHO ‘strongly advises against’ use of 2 COVID treatments,"LONDON, United Kingdom – Two COVID-19 antibody therapies are no longer recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), on the basis that Omicron and the variant’s latest offshoots have likely rendered them obsolete.
The two therapies – which are designed to work by binding to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to neutralise the virus’ ability to infect cells – were some of the first medicines developed early in the pandemic.
The virus has since evolved, and mounting evidence from lab tests suggests the two therapies – sotrovimab as well as casirivimab-imdevimab – have limited clinical activity against the latest iterations of the virus. As a result, they have also fallen out of favour with the US health regulator.
On Thursday, September 15, WHO experts said they strongly advised against the use of the two therapies in patients with COVID-19, reversing previous conditional recommendations endorsing them, as part of a suite of recommendations published in the British Medical Journal.
GSK and partner Vir Biotechnology’s sotrovimab – which has generated billions in sales and became one of the British drugmaker’s top sellers last year – was pulled off the US market by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April.
Given the United States had begun to question sotrovimab’s clinical effectiveness against Omicron as early as February, the WHO’s realization is coming a little late, said Penny Ward, visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London.
“Now WHO has issued this recommendation, it will be interesting to see how many other countries align with it,” she said.
Regeneron and partner Roche’s antibody cocktail casirivimab-imdevimab has also generated billions in sales and was one of the US drugmaker’s top sellers last year.
Back in January, the FDA revised its stance on the treatment, limiting its use to a smaller group of patients, citing its diminished potency against the Omicron variant.
Both therapies continue to be recommended for use by the European drugs regulator.
Another COVID therapy that emerged early in pandemic was Gilead’s antiviral remdesivir. The WHO expanded its conditional recommendation for the drug, advising that it can be used in patients with severe COVID as well as non-severe COVID patients at the highest risk of hospitalization.
There are a handful of existing COVID therapeutics that remain useful in the fight against the virus, and others in development that are expected to also benefit patients.",Reuters,"Sep 16, 2022 7:36 AM PHT"

The inhaled version of Cansino’s adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine has obtained the green light from the National Medical Products Administration, the company said in a filing on Sunday.
“The approval will have a positive impact on the company’s performance if the vaccine is subsequently purchased and used by relevant government agencies,” CanSino said.
The company cautioned, however, that it will face fierce competition from other vaccines in China that have also obtained government approval or are in clinical trials.
China granted emergency use authorization to Livzon Pharmaceutical Group Inc’s 000513.SZ1513.HK COVID-19 vaccine as a booster, Livzon said on Friday, September 2, one of just two new products against the disease the country had cleared in more than a year.
Cansino also said it was uncertain when its vaccine would be able to go to market, since additional administrative approvals are still needed, while sales would depend on the COVID-19 situation at home and abroad, as well as China’s vaccination rate.
China has seen a recent flare-up in COVID outbreaks. The southern tech hub of Shenzhen imposed a weekend lockdown in most parts of the city on Saturday, September 3, while the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu put its 21 million people under lockdown on Thursday, September 1.

Both vaccines include the original version of the virus targeted by all the previous COVID shots as the country prepares for another vaccination campaign in the fall season.
The FDA authorized Moderna’s vaccine for those aged 18 and above and Pfizer’s for those aged 12 and above to be given at least two months after the primary vaccination series or the most recent booster shot.
The US government has secured 105 million doses of Pfizer’s updated shots and 66 million doses of Moderna’s bivalent vaccine to stave off the worst effects of a likely surge in infections as schools reconvene and people spend more time indoors as the weather grows colder.
Pfizer said it has some doses ready to ship immediately and can deliver up to 15 million doses by September 9.
The FDA in June asked vaccine makers to tailor shots to the two subvariants responsible for the most recent surge in infections worldwide. The BA.5 subvariant accounts for more than 88% of US infections.
The vaccine makers have not completed testing of the updated BA.4/BA.5-based boosters in humans. The FDA is basing its decision on safety and effectiveness data from the original shots as well as from clinical trials conducted on bivalent boosters using the BA.1 Omicron subvariant.
“We are confident in the evidence supporting these authorizations,” said Dr. Peter Marks, a senior officialoverseeing vaccines at the US FDA.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/first-synthetic-embryos-raises-serious-ethical-question/,First synthetic embryos: The scientific breakthrough raises serious ethical question,"Children, even some who are too young for school, know you can’t make a baby without sperm and an egg. But a team of researchers in Israel have called into question the basics of what we teach children about the birds and the bees, and created a mouse embryo using just stem cells.
It lived for eight days, about half a mouse’s gestation period, inside a bioreactor in the lab.
In 2021 the research team used the same artificial womb to grow natural mouse embryos (fertilized from sperm and eggs), which lived for 11 days. The lab-created womb, or external uterus, was a breakthrough in itself as embryos could not survive in petri dishes.
If you’re picturing a kind of silicone womb, think again. The external uterus is a rotating device filled with glass bottles of nutrients. This movement simulates how blood and nutrients flow to the placenta. The device also replicates the atmospheric pressure of a mouse uterus.
Some of the cells were treated with chemicals, which switched on genetic programs to develop into placenta or yolk sac. Others developed into organs and other tissues without intervention. While most of the stem cells failed, about 0.5% were very similar to a natural eight-day-old embryo with a beating heart, basic nervous system and a yolk-sac.
These new technologies raise several ethical and legal concerns.
In the latest study, the scientists started with collections of stem cells. The conditions created by the external uterus triggered the developmental process that makes a fetus. Although the scientists said we are a long way off synthetic human embryos, the experiment brings us closer to a future where some humans gestate their babies artificially.
Each year over 300,000 women worldwide die in childbirth or as a result of pregnancy complications, many because they lack basic care.  Even in wealthy countries, pregnancy and childbirth is risky and healthcare providers are criticized for failing mothers.
There is an urgent need to make healthcare more accessible across the planet, provide better mental health support for mothers and make pregnancy and childbirth safer. In an ideal world every parent should expect excellent care in all aspects of motherhood. This technology could help treat premature babies and give at least some women a different option: a choice of whether to carry their child or use an external uterus.
Some philosophers say there is a moral imperative to develop artificial wombs to help remedy the unfairness of parenting roles. But other researchers say artificial wombs would threaten a women’s legal right to terminate a pregnancy.
In the last few years, scientists have learned more about how to coax stem cells to develop into increasingly sophisticated structures, including ones that mimic the structure and function of human organs (organoids). Artificial human kidneys, brains, hearts and more have all been created in a lab, though they are still too rudimentary for medical use.
The issue of whether there are moral differences between using stem cells to produce models of human organs for research and using stem cells to create a synthetic embryo are already playing out in law courts.
One of the key differences between organoids and synthetic embryos is their potential. If a synthetic embryo can develop into a living creature, it should have more protection than those which don’t.
Synthetic embryos do not currently have potential to actually create a living mouse. If scientists did make human synthetic embryos, but without the potential to form a living being, they should arguably be treated similarly to organoids.
Some countries (for example Australia) have taken the position that synthetic embryos such as “blastoids” (which resemble five-to-six-day-old embryos) should be treated like natural embryos, because of similarities in structure. Other countries (such as the UK, the US, Japan) treat synthetic embryos as different from embryos because they can’t currently produce a live baby.
Another important legal issue is the source of stem cells and consent. The synthetic mouse embryo creators used stem cells from early embryos.
However, in the future it might be possible to make synthetic embryos from induced pluripotent stem cells (IPS). The worst case scenario would be a person donates a skin cell to research into producing organs to cure disease but this is used without their knowledge or consent to produce synthetic embryos.
IPS cells are created by taking a mature cell (such as a skin cell) from a living or dead person and applying treatments  which drive it backwards to a more immature state. If the cell could be driven all the way back to an embryonic stem cell, it may one day be possible to use IPS cells to make viable embryos.
That embryo would be a clone of the cell donor. The public and scientists  have huge concerns about human cloning.
But it has been possible to clone a human being using a different process called nuclear transfer, for 25 years. Nuclear transfer created Dolly the Sheep in 1997 and a monkey in 2018. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a flurry of laws introduced around the world successfully banned human cloning.
We should not let our fears about cloning stand in the way of crucial research. The benefits could make organ donor waiting lists a thing of the past, save premature babies and give women an option to have children a different way. Cloning, or any other unethical use of the technology, can be prevented by regulation. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/explainer-why-polio-found-london-new-york-jerusalem-how-dangerous/,"EXPLAINER: Why has polio been found in London, New York and Jerusalem, and how dangerous is it?","LONDON, United Kingdom – Polio, a deadly disease that used to paralyze tens of thousands of children every year, is spreading in London, New York, and Jerusalem for the first time in decades, spurring catch-up vaccination campaigns.
Polio terrified parents around the world for the first half of the 20th century. Affecting mainly children under five, it is often asymptomatic but can also cause symptoms including fever and vomiting. Around one in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis, and among those patients, up to 10% die.
There is no cure, but since a vaccine was found in the 1950s, polio is entirely preventable. Globally, the wild form of the disease has almost disappeared.
Afghanistan and Pakistan are now the only countries where the highly infectious disease, spread mainly through contact with fecal matter, remains endemic. But this year, imported cases were also found in Malawi and Mozambique, the first in those countries since the 1990s.
There are two main forms of poliovirus. Alongside the wild-type outlined above, there are also rare cases of what is known as vaccine-derived polio.
It is this second form detected in wastewater in the British capital, London, and in New York in the United States, with one case of paralysis reported in New York state. Genetically similar virus has also been found in Jerusalem, Israel, and scientists are working to understand the link, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) said.
While vaccine-derived polio is almost unheard of in the above locations, it is a known – albeit rare – threat in other countries, causing outbreaks every year, including 415 cases in Nigeria in 2021.
It stems from the use of an oral polio vaccine containing weakened live virus. After children are vaccinated, they shed virus in their feces for a few weeks. In under-vaccinated communities, this can then spread and mutate back to a harmful version of the virus.
While countries including the Britain and the United States no longer use this live vaccine, others do – particularly to stop outbreaks – which allows for global spread, particularly as people began to travel again after COVID-19, experts said.
But experts agree that the major driver behind both vaccine-derived and wild polio outbreaks remains under-vaccinated populations, said Derek Ehrhardt, global polio lead at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Vaccine hesitancy was a growing problem before the pandemic, then COVID-19 caused the worst disruption to routine immunization in a generation, according to the United Nations.
In 2020, there were 1,081 vaccine-derived polio cases, around three times as many as the previous year.
In 2022 so far, there have been 177 cases, after major efforts to get polio vaccination campaigns back on track.
But the wastewater findings are still a wake-up call for parents with one key message, according to scientists around the world, including David Heymann, epidemiologist at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine: Protect children by getting them vaccinated.",Reuters,"Aug 16, 2022 10:58 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/what-is-langya-virus-do-we-need-to-be-worried/,What is this new Langya virus? Do we need to be worried?,"A new virus, Langya henipavirus, is suspected to have caused infections in 35 people in China’s Shandong and Henan provinces over roughly a two-year period to 2021.
It’s related to Hendra and Nipah viruses, which cause disease in humans. However, there’s much we don’t know about the new virus – known as LayV for short – including whether it spreads from human to human.
Here’s what we know so far.
Researchers in China first detected this new virus as part of routine surveillance in people with a fever who had reported recent contact with animals. Once the virus was identified, the researchers looked for the virus in other people.
Symptoms reported appeared to be mostly mild – fever, fatigue, cough, loss of appetite, muscle aches, nausea and headache – although we don’t know how long the patients were unwell.
A smaller proportion had potentially more serious complications, including pneumonia, and abnormalities in liver and kidney function. However, the severity of these abnormalities, the need for hospitalization, and whether any cases were fatal were not reported.
The authors also investigated whether domestic or wild animals may have been the source of the virus. Although they found a small number of goats and dogs that may have been infected with the virus in the past, there was more direct evidence a significant proportion of wild shrews were harboring the virus.
This suggests humans may have caught the virus from wild shrews.
The researchers used a modern technique known as metagenomic analysis to find this new virus. Researchers sequence all genetic material then discard the “known” sequences (for example, human DNA) to look for “unknown” sequences that might represent a new virus.
This raises the question about how scientists can tell whether a particular virus causes the disease.
We have traditionally used “Koch’s postulates” to determine whether a particular micro-organism causes disease:
The authors acknowledge this new virus doesn’t yet meet these criteria, and the relevance of these criteria in the modern era has been questioned.
However, the authors say they didn’t find any other cause of the illness in 26 people, there was evidence 14 people’s immune systems had responded to the virus, and people who were more unwell had more virus.
This new virus appears to be a close cousin of two other viruses that are significant in humans: Nipah virus and Hendra virus. This family of viruses was the inspiration for the fictional MEV-1 virus in the film Contagion.
Hendra virus was first reported in Queensland in 1994, when it caused the deaths of 14 horses and the trainer Vic Rail.
Many outbreaks in horses have been reported in Queensland and northern New South Wales since, and are generally thought to be due to “spillover” infections from flying foxes.
In total, seven human cases of Hendra virus have been reported in Australia (mostly veterinarians working with sick horses), including four deaths.
Nipah virus is more significant globally, with outbreaks frequently reported in Bangladesh.
The severity of infection can range from very mild to fatal encephalitis (inflammation of the brain).
The first outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore was reported in people who had close contact with pigs. However, it is thought more recent outbreaks have been due to food contaminated with the urine or saliva of infected bats.
Significantly, Nipah virus appears to be transmitted from person to person, mostly among household contacts.
Little is known about this new virus, and the currently reported cases are likely to be the tip of the iceberg.
At this stage, there is no indication the virus can spread from human to human.
Further work is required to determine how severe the infection can be, how it spreads, and how widespread it might be in China and the region.  – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/sars-related-coronaviruses-infections-southeast-asia/,"SARS-related coronaviruses infect around 66,000 people a year in Southeast Asia","SHANGHAI, China – About 66,000 people in Southeast Asia are infected each year with SARS-related coronaviruses, and nearly 500 million people live near habitats where bat hosts of those viruses are found, according to a study released on Wednesday, August 10.
The research, published by Nature Communications, said viral transmission from bats to humans may have been “substantially underestimated,” adding that its mapping of bat species in the region could aid efforts to determine the origins of COVID-19.
The researchers focused on 26 species of bat known to host SARS-like coronaviruses in a region of 5.1 million square kilometers (2 million square miles), stretching from China to Southeast and South Asia. They then incorporated data on antibody levels among people who have reported bat contact.
Southern China, northeastern Myanmar, Laos and northern Vietnam were identified as the regions with the highest diversity of bat species that host SARS-like coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs).
“Our estimate that a median of 66,000 people are infected with SARSr-CoVs each year in Southeast Asia suggests that bat-to-human SARSr-CoV spillover is common in the region, and is undetected by surveillance programs and clinical studies in the majority of cases,” they said.
“These data on the geography and scale of spillover can be used to target surveillance and prevention programs for potential future bat-CoV emergence,” the paper said.
COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strain.
The authors of the study include Peter Daszak, a member of the World Health Organization (WHO) team that was tasked with investigating the origins of the COVID-19 and visited Wuhan early last year, where the pandemic was first identified at the end of 2019.
The WHO said in June that the lack of data from China made it difficult to determine when and how the coronavirus first crossed over into the human population.
A study published by the journal Science at the end of July said live wildlife trade was still the best explanation for the origins of the pandemic, with two separate spillovers likely to have taken place at the Huanan Seafood Market, where many of the earliest cases were clustered.",Reuters,"Aug 10, 2022 1:19 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/analysis-more-chinese-women-give-up-having-babies-after-zero-covid-ordeal/,More Chinese women delay or give up on having babies after zero-COVID ordeal,"HONG KONG – Seeing Chinese authorities exercise extraordinary powers during a stringent COVID-19 lockdown in Shanghai earlier this year altered Claire Jiang’s life plans: she no longer wants to have babies in China.
During the April-May lockdown, the hashtag “we are the last generation” briefly went viral on Chinese social media before being censored.
The phrase echoed the response of a man who was visited by authorities in hazmat suits threatening to punish his family for three generations for non-compliance with COVID rules.
“That really resonated,” said Jiang, who internalized the man’s remark as her own answer to the motherhood question.
“I definitely don’t want my children to have to carry the uncertainty of living in a country where the government can just come to your door and do whatever they want,” said the 30-year-old, who works in the media industry.
Studies have shown that pandemics and economic uncertainty historically weigh on birth rates around the world.
I definitely don’t want my children to have to carry the uncertainty of living in a country where the government can just come to your door and do whatever they want.
But, particular to China, its uncompromising “zero-COVID” policy of promptly stamping out any outbreaks with strict controls on people’s lives may have caused profound damage on their desire to have children, demographers say.
Accounts of people losing income or not having access to healthcare or food, or of authorities forcefully entering homes to take people to quarantine centers, including elderly and children, abounded during lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere.
Demographers say people’s feelings of losing control over their lives from events like those can have major consequences on parenthood goals.
“China is obviously big government and small family,” said prominent Chinese demographer Yi Fuxian. “China’s zero-COVID policy has led to a zero economy, zero marriages, zero fertility.”
China’s National Health Commission and its Family Planning Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Chinese authorities have repeatedly said zero-COVID is necessary to save lives, pointing to the millions of deaths around the world compared to only 5,226 officially reported in China since the start of the pandemic.
A July United Nations report predicts China’s population of 1.4 billion may start to decline as early as next year, when India will overtake it as the world’s most populous country.
UN experts now see China’s population shrinking by 109 million by 2050, more than triple the decline of their previous forecast in 2019.
A separate UN China report said the pandemic had a long-term impact on first births, with women citing financial insecurity, unsubstantiated worries about COVID vaccines affecting fetuses, along with difficulties in carrying a pregnancy and taking care of an infant under heavy restrictions.
“Couples that may have been thinking about having a child in the next year, definitely postponed those. Couples that really weren’t sure, have postponed indefinitely,” said Justine Coulson, the UN Population Fund Representative to China.
New births are set to fall to record lows this year, demographers say, dropping below 10 million from last year’s 10.6 million babies – which were already 11.5% lower than in 2020.
Official 2022 population data is not expected until early next year, but some places in China have published worrying statistics in recent weeks.
Screening for birth defects – a reliable proxy for birthrates – in China’s third most populous province Henan fell 9.5% year-on-year in the first six months.
Cities elsewhere reported double-digit drops in new birth certificates. Jiaozhou, a city of 1 million in Shandong province, saw a 26% drop in the first six months. Hukou, in Jiangxi province, saw a 42% dive.
Corporate earnings statements also provide some hints: formula maker Ausnutria Dairy, diaper producer Aiyingshi and Goodbaby, which makes cribs and strollers, are among firms citing China’s falling births as factors leading to losses in the first half of the year.
None of those figures reflect the impact lockdowns such as those in Shanghai and elsewhere had earlier this year.
But demographers say they do offer a glimpse into how COVID-19 restrictions in 2020 and 2021 affected births and expect 2022 to be worse.
Demographer Yi collated data on infants tuberculosis vaccines, marriage registrations and searches for maternity and baby products on Baidu, China’s main search engine. He estimates COVID will result in 1 million fewer births in 2021 and 2022 combined, and 2023 could be even worse.
China, which imposed a one-child policy from 1980 to 2015, has officially acknowledged it is on the brink of a demographic downturn.
Its fertility rate of 1.16 in 2021 was below the 2.1 OECD standard for a stable population and among the lowest in the world.
Over the past year or so, authorities have introduced measures such as tax deductions, longer maternity leave, enhanced medical insurance, housing subsidies, extra money for a third child and a crackdown on expensive private tutoring.
Still, the desire for Chinese women to have children is the lowest in the world, a survey published in February by think-tank YuWa Population Research showed.
Demographers say measures taken so far are not enough. They cite high education costs, low wages and notoriously long working hours as issues that still need to be addressed, along with COVID policies and economic growth concerns.
A key root cause of low birth rates, according to Peter McDonald, professor of demography at University of Melbourne, is gender inequality, where China is ranked 102nd out of 146 countries by the World Economic Forum.
Jiahui Wu, a 25-year-old financial analyst, said society’s standards for a good mother were strict.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/african-monkeypox-cases-not-concentrated-among-gay-men-experts/,"African monkeypox cases not concentrated among gay men, experts say","JOHANNESBURG, South Africa – Monkeypox outbreaks in Africa are not concentrated among gay men, unlike in other parts of the world, experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Africa CDC said on Thursday, August 4.
Outbreaks of the viral disease have been reported from 78 countries, mostly in Europe, and 98% of cases outside the countries in Africa where it is endemic have been reported in men who have sex with men, the WHO says.
But in Africa, where repeated outbreaks have been documented since the 1970s, the pattern of transmission is different, the experts said.
“Currently 60% of the cases that we have – the 350 – 60% are men, 40% are women,” said epidemiologist Dr Otim Patrick Ramadan, who was answering questions on monkeypox at a media briefing organized by the WHO’s regional office in Africa, and who was referring to the continent’s number of current cases.
He said that more than 80% of cases in Africa were in countries where transmission had happened before, and that typically people were initially exposed to the virus through contact with animals carrying it, before passing it to household members.
He added that women typically took care of sick people at home, which was one of the factors in the spread among women.
Dr. Ahmed Ogwell Ouma, acting director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told a separate media briefing there was no evidence that transmission among gay men was a specific factor in African outbreaks.
“We’ve been collecting data on monkeypox since 1970 and that particular indicator, men having sex with men, has never come up as a significant issue here in Africa,” he said.
More than 18,000 cases of monkeypox have been reported worldwide in what the WHO has declared to be a global health emergency.
Monkeypox spreads via close contact and tends to cause flu-like symptoms and pus-filled skin lesions.
Public health agencies have stressed that although in many countries the outbreaks are concentrated among men who have sex with men, anyone can contract the virus through prolonged close contact or from particles on items such as bedding or towels.",Reuters,"Aug 5, 2022 12:05 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/organ-decay-halted-cell-function-restored-pigs-after-death-study/,"Organ decay halted, cell function restored in pigs after death – study","Researchers have found that decay of tissues after death can be halted and cell functions restored based on early experiments in pigs that may eventually help increase the number of transplantable human organs.
Sixty minutes after stopping the heart in the anesthetized animals, Yale researchers were able to restart the circulation using a specialized machine and a synthetic fluid carrying oxygen and other components that promote cellular health and suppress inflammation.
Six hours later, treatment with the so-called OrganEx technology had reduced or corrected some of the damage, such as organ swelling and collapse of blood vessels, that typically results from lack of oxygen when cardiac arrest halts blood flow.
The results show that when the heart stops, the body is “not as dead as we previously assumed,” Zvonimir Vrselja of Yale University said at a press briefing. “We were able to show that we can persuade cells not to die.”
Genetic analysis of the tissues suggested that molecular and cellular repair processes had begun once circulation had been restored, the researchers reported on Wednesday in the journal Nature.
Compared to the traditional means of restoring circulation – extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) – OrganEx “preserved tissue integrity, decreased cell death and restored selected molecular and cellular processes across multiple vital organs,” the researchers wrote.
During the entire experiment, the pigs had no evidence of electrical activity in the brain, the researchers said.
They hope OrganEx will eventually enable increased use of organs retrieved after withdrawal of life support in donors with severe, irreversible brain injuries by preventing the damage that ensues when blood stops circulating. Currently, these organs do worse after transplant than those procured from brain-dead donors who remain on life-support.
That could be years away, however.
The pig study result “stops far short of saying that any organs were restored to the level of function” necessary to support life, said Stephen Latham of Yale’s Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics.
Theoretically, the technology could someday be used to restore life in someone who has just died. “In order to do that, there’s a great deal more experimentation that would be required,” Latham said. “And you’d have to think about what is the state to which a human being would be restored.”
Use in organ transplantation is a much closer, more realistic goal, Latham said. Any use of OrganEx as a medical therapy “is going to be a long ways away.”",Reuters,"Aug 4, 2022 7:40 AM PHT"

Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in the city of Daejeon southwest of Seoul have developed an electronic tattoo ink made of liquid metal and carbon nanotubes that functions as a bioelectrode.
Hooked up to an electrocardiogram (ECG) device or other biosensor, it can send a readout of a patient’s heart rate and other vital signs such glucose and lactate to a monitor.
The researchers eventually aim to be able to dispense with biosensors.
“In the future, what we hope to do is connect a wireless chip integrated with this ink, so that we can communicate, or we can send signal back and forth between our body to an external device,” said project leader Steve Park, a materials science and engineering professor.
Such monitors could in theory be located anywhere, including in patients’ homes.
The ink is non-invasive and made from particles based on gallium, a soft, silvery metal also used in semiconductors or in thermometers. Platinum-decorated carbon nanotubes help conduct electricity while providing durability.
“When it is applied to the skin, even with rubbing the tattoo doesn’t come off, which is not possible with just liquid metal,” Park said.",Reuters,"Aug 2, 2022 7:57 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/india-confirms-asia-first-monkeypox-death/,India confirms Asia’s first monkeypox death,"KOCHI, India – India confirmed its first monkeypox death on Monday, August 1, a young man in the southern state of Kerala, in what is only the fourth known fatality from thedisease in the current outbreak.
Last week, Spain reported two monkeypox-related deaths and Brazil its first. The death in India is also the first in Asia.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency on July 23.
The 22-year-old Indian man died on Saturday, Kerala’s revenue minister told reporters, adding that the government had isolated 21 people who had come in contact with him.
“The person reached Kerala on July 21 but visited a hospital only on July 26 when he displayed fatigue and fever,” Minister K. Rajan said, adding that there was no reason to panic as none of the primary contacts were showing symptoms.
Kerala’s health minister, Veena George, told reporters on Sunday that the man’s family told authorities the previous day that he had tested positive in the United Arab Emirates before returning to India.
India’s federal health ministry had no comment on the death, except for saying that the government had formed a task force of senior officials to monitor monkeypox cases in the country, where local media have reported at least five infections.
The WHO said late last month 78 countries had reported more than 18,000 cases of monkeypox, the majority in Europe.
It says the monkeypox virus causes a disease with less severe symptoms than smallpox and occurs mainly in central and west Africa. The disease is transmitted from animals to humans.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/if-high-risk-do-not-wait-for-updated-covid-19-vaccines-experts-say/,"If you’re high risk, do not wait for updated COVID-19 vaccines, experts say","CHICAGO, USA – People at high risk of severe disease who have yet to get a second COVID-19 booster should not wait for next-generation, Omicron-targeted vaccines expected in the fall, five vaccine experts told Reuters.
In many countries, including the United States, the BA.5 Omicron subvariant of the virus is surging, but current vaccines continue to offer protection against hospitalization for severe disease and death.
And, as the virus evolves, it is not known what version will be widely circulating in the fall or whether new vaccines – expected to target BA.4/5 in the United States and BA.1 in Europe – will be a good match.
“If you need a booster, get it now,” said Dr. John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, who co-wrote an editorial on the subject currently under review.
In the United States, regulators have asked Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc to develop vaccine boosters that target both the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron cousins, as well as the original virus. They are expected to be ready by October.
Regulators in Europe, meanwhile, have signaled that they would be willing to use whichever Omicron-based booster is available to Europe soonest, which may well be the one aimed at the BA.1 variant that drove last winter’s record surge in infections.
US regulators are hoping an updated vaccine that targets the original strain and an Omicron variant will offer broader protection against future variants, and believe a booster that is closest to the circulating version is valuable.
Given the current surge and people’s waning immunity, experts told Reuters the best booster for those at risk is the one at hand.
Only about 30% of people 50 and older who are eligible for a fourth vaccine dose have received one, and fewer than 10% of those aged 50-64, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For those under age 50 or with no major risk factors, a fourth dose has not been approved and there is little support for it among scientific experts.
Moore said the evidence he has seen, including at a June US Food and Drug Administration meeting and since, all suggest that the benefit of a BA.4/5 booster compared to the original vaccine is “negligible” in terms of preventing infection.
“The public should not regard these Omicron-based boosters as some kind of magic bullet that’s going to change the face of the pandemic and solve all their problems. It will have a marginal impact compared to the booster we currently have,” he said.
Dr Eric Topol, a genomics expert and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, said getting a second booster offers a survival benefit over just one booster that has been documented in five different studies.
“Too many people are waiting when we have really good proof,” he said.
Dr. Bob Wachter, chief of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said the evidence is increasingly clear that the longer a person has gone since their last booster, the less protection they have against infection and severe disease.
“There’s a ton of COVID around, and it’s a very infectious agent,” he said.
BA.5 has driven a wave of new cases globally, and now makes up nearly 82% of all US coronavirus infections.
Wachter is not convinced retooled BA.4/5 vaccines will be ready to roll out in two months. “It seems a bit ambitious to me, and even if they hit the timeline, it will probably go to the highest-risk groups first,” he said. “I think it’s probably three or four months away for the average person.”
Pfizer told Reuters it has a few million shots of a BA.4/5 vaccine manufactured.
As for the newly authorized Novavax Inc vaccine, the company has yet to seek approval for its use as a booster.
Moore, who participated in the Novavax clinical trial, said while it is an excellent vaccine, the company’s boosters are unlikely to be available soon. Novavax has said it is developing a BA.4/5 booster and is aiming to have it ready by the fourth quarter.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/monkeypox-emergency-could-last-months-window-closing-stop-spread/,"Monkeypox emergency could last months, with window closing to stop spread – experts","LONDON, United Kingdom – Scientists advising the World Health Organization (WHO) on monkeypox say the window is closing to stop its spread, with cases currently doubling every two weeks, raising concerns that it will take several months for the outbreak to peak.
WHO Europe has forecast just over 27,000 monkeypox cases in 88 countries by August 2, up from 17,800 cases in nearly 70 countries at the latest count.
Making predictions beyond that are complex, scientists around the world told Reuters, but there is likely to be sustained transmission for several months and possibly longer, they said.
“We have to get in front of this,” said Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
“It’s clear the window of opportunity for doing so is closing,” added Rimoin, a member of the WHO expert committee on monkeypox that met last week to determine whether the outbreak constituted a global health emergency.
A majority of committee members voted against the move and, in an unprecedented step, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared an emergency anyway.
Action stemming from that declaration needs to be urgent, including increased vaccination, testing, isolation for those infected and contact tracing, global health experts said.
“Transmission is clearly unchecked,” said Antoine Flahault, director of the Institute of Global Health at the University of Geneva, who chairs the WHO Europe advisory group. Jimmy Whitworth, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said he expected that cases would not plateau for at least the next four-to-six months, or until the those at highest risk of infection have been either vaccinated or infected. Sexual health organizations in the UK recently estimated that could be around 125,000 people.
Monkeypox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades, but cases began to be reported outside countries where it is endemic in May.
It generally causes mild to moderate symptoms, including fever, fatigue and the hallmark painful skin lesions, that resolve within a few weeks. Five people have died in the current outbreak, all of them in Africa.
Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases.
“I remember clearly … saying that ‘I think I’m going to die,’ because I can’t eat, I can’t drink. I can’t even swallow my own spit,” said Harun Tulunay, 35, a sexual health advocate who was hospitalized with monkeypox in London earlier this month but has since recovered.
While monkeypox is not causing large numbers of deaths globally, an unpleasant virus establishing itself in new populations is still bad news, scientists said.
Flahault’s group has modeled three scenarios for the coming months, all of which include “sustained transmission,” either between men who have sex with men; beyond these groups and possibly into more vulnerable populations, like children, or between humans and animals.
The latter scenario risks the establishment of a monkeypox reservoir in animals in new countries, as it has in parts of west and central Africa, said Flahault.
Ongoing transmission could also lead to mutations that make the virus more efficient at spreading in humans, scientists said.
On Tuesday, German scientists released a study ahead of peer review that found mutations in one of the 47 cases they sequenced that could help monkeypox spread in people more easily.
“The alarm bell was going off (in Africa) but we kept hitting the snooze button. Now it’s time to wake up and do something about it,” Rimoin said. “An infection anywhere is potentially an infection everywhere.”",Reuters,"Jul 27, 2022 2:11 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/explainer-should-we-worry-about-monkeypox-global-health-emergency/,EXPLAINER: How worried should we be about the monkeypox global health emergency?,"The United States declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency, a move that may increase health agency access to funds and allow the government new avenues for increasing production and use of existing vaccines.
The move follows the declaration by the World Health Organization in July. A Reuters tally has counted more than 25,800 cases globally and three countries outside of Africa have reported deaths.
First identified in monkeys, the virus is transmitted chiefly through close contact with an infected person. It typically causes mild symptoms including fever, rash, swollen lymph nodes and pus-filled skin lesions. Severe cases can occur though people tend to recover within two to four weeks, according to the WHO.
Anyone can spread the virus, but the current outbreak outside of Africa is concentrated almost exclusively among men who have sex with men.
Monkeypox spreads primarily via intimate skin-to-skin contact, usually with someone who has an active rash, as well as via contact with contaminated clothes or bedding. It is not as easily transmitted as the SARS-CoV-2 virus that spurred the COVID-19 pandemic.
The United States hopes the public health emergency declaration will help it contain the disease before it becomes endemic. This status unleashes funding and gives health agencies regulatory flexibility that could help increase access to vaccines and treatments.
Health officials from several countries had urged the WHO to label monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern due to the quick escalation of cases and concerns it may become endemic in more countries.
The emergency declaration aims to spur global action and collaboration on everything from testing to the production and distribution of vaccines and treatments.
The fatality rate in preceding monkeypox outbreaks in Africa of the strain currently spreading has been around 1%, but so far this outbreak appears to be less lethal in the non-endemic countries, many of which have stronger healthcare infrastructure. Until this year, the viral disease has rarely spread outside Africa where it is endemic.
Scientists are trying to determine what caused the initial cases and if the virus has changed. Increased global travel as well as climate change have generally accelerated the emergence and spread of viruses, experts say.
Infectious disease experts say that years of financial neglect has left sexual health clinics on the frontline of the current monkeypox response ill-prepared to curb further spread.
Health officials say that people should avoid close personal contact with someone who has an illness presenting with a distinctive rash or who is otherwise unwell. People who suspect they have monkeypox should isolate and seek medical care.
Health officials have also been offering monkeypox vaccines to high-risk individuals and those that have recently been in close contact with an infected person.
Danish company Bavarian Nordic has a vaccine that goes by the brand name Jynneos, Imvamune or Imvanex – depending on geography. It has US and European approval for the prevention of both smallpox and the closely related monkeypox.
An older vaccine, currently made by Emergent Biosolutions, is called ACAM2000, but its uptake has been limited due to a severe side-effect warning.
Bavarian Nordic says it can produce 30 million doses of its vaccines – including the monkeypox one – each year, and has tapped a US-based contract manufacturer to increase monkeypox vaccine capacity.
Monkeypox symptoms often resolve on their own within weeks. Patients may receive extra fluids and additional treatment for secondary bacterial infections.

Health experts on the panel voted to support a motion that they would await more data from ongoing clinical trials and continue discussions on the drug, dealing another blow to Shionogi’s global ambitions for the antiviral pill.
Authorities had postponed a decision last month on the drug known as S-217622, which Shionogi hopes will compete with products from US drugmakers Pfizer and Merck & Co that have already been approved in Japan and elsewhere.
The company has signed an agreement to sell about a million doses to the Japanese government, pending the drug’s approval.
Chief Executive Isao Teshirogi has said that annual production of the drug could reach 10 million doses. It has received US government support for a global Phase III trial.
Speculation about the treatment has sent Shionogi’s shares on a rollercoaster ride.
Last month a health ministry panel postponed ruling on the drug because of uncertainty over its effectiveness as well as animal studies showing it could pose a risk to pregnancies.
Shionogi this month said it was preparing to seek approval in China for the drug, shown in pre-clinical studies to display high antiviral activity against the Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5.
Some members of the health panel said that while trial data had not proved the effectiveness of the drug, the results were positive enough to grant emergency approval to help to tackle a seventh wave of infections and possibly reduce the incidence of so-called “long COVID” effects in patients.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesian-court-rejects-call-legalize-medicinal-marijuana/,Indonesian court rejects call to legalize medicinal marijuana,"JAKARTA, Indonesia – Indonesia’s Constitutional Court on Wednesday, July 20, rejected a judicial review of the country’s narcotics law that would have paved the way for legalizing marijuana for medicinal use.
Three mothers of children with cerebral palsy backed by civil society organizations filed a judicial review of the country’s strict narcotics law in 2020, arguing for the use of medicinal marijuana to treat symptoms.
The judges said there was insufficient research to justify a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, but urged the government to “immediately” conduct research on the therapeutic usage of narcotics.
“The court needs to emphasize that the government immediately follow up … The results of which can be used to determine policies, including in this case the possibility of changing the law,” said judge Suhartoyo, who like many Indonesians uses one name only.
Decriminalization of cannabis would be a dramatic shift for the Southeast Asian nation, which has one of the world’s strictest anti-drug laws with penalties for possession or trafficking of large quantities of narcotics including life imprisonment and death.
The plaintiffs had argued that not being allowed to use narcotics for medical reasons was a constitutional violation of citizens’ rights to obtain health services and benefit from the development of science and technology.
“The Constitutional Court has only shifted the responsibility to the government by asking the government to immediately conduct research,” said Yosua Octavian, from the Legal Aid Institute, a civil society group involved in the case.
“The point has been rejected … So people who use marijuana for health reasons in Indonesia will continue to be punished.”
The issue gained traction after a video of a campaigner went viral after being posted on social media.
Standing in downtown Jakarta, Santi Warastuti, one of the plaintiffs whose 13-year-old daughter has cerebral palsy, held a placard that read: “Help, my child needs medical marijuana.”
In a briefing after the ruling, the 43-year-old mother urged the government to provide other solutions.
“Research to turn [medical marijuana] into therapeutics will take a while, whereas we as parents of children with special needs are racing against time,” she said.

In an interview with Reuters, WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge urged countries to take action now to avoid overwhelming health systems as the spread of the Omicron subvariant, BA.5, gathers steam.
Close to three million new COVID-19 cases were reported in the European region last week, which accounted for nearly half of all new cases globally. Hospitalization rates have doubled over the same period, and close to 3,000 people die of the disease every week, Kluge said in an accompanying statement.
“There is a rise in cases … amidst a society which is functioning almost as before,” he said, underscoring the need for so-called pandemic stabilizers such as a second booster dose ahead of the expected variant-specific vaccines in the autumn, as well as the promotion of mask wearing and ventilation.
These stabilizers must be implemented to avoid much stricter measures, he cautioned. “I don’t think society is ready for ordered lockdowns.”",Reuters,"Jul 19, 2022 7:13 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pandemic-largest-backslide-childhood-vaccination-in-generation-united-nations/,Pandemic behind ‘largest backslide in childhood vaccination in a generation’ – UN,"LONDON, United Kingdom – Around 25 million children around the world missed out on routine vaccinations that protect against life-threatening diseases in 2021, as the knock-on effects of the pandemic continue to disrupt health care globally.
That is two million more children than in 2020, when COVID-19 caused lockdowns around the world, and 6 million more than pre-pandemic in 2019, according to new figures released by Unicef and the World Health Organization.
Unicef described the drop in vaccination coverage as the largest sustained backslide in childhood vaccination in a generation, taking coverage rates back to levels not seen since the early 2000s.
Many had hoped that 2021 would see some ground recovered after the first year of the pandemic, but the situation actually worsened, raising questions over catch-up efforts.
“I want to get across the urgency,” Unicef’s senior immunization specialist, Niklas Danielsson told Reuters. “This is a child health crisis.”
The agency said that a focus on COVID-19 immunization campaigns in 2021, as well as the economic slowdown and strain on healthcare systems, had stymied a quicker recovery for routine vaccinations.
Coverage dropped in every region, the figures showed, which are estimated using data on the take-up of the three-dose diptheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) jab and include both children who get no jabs at all and those who miss on any of the three doses necessary for protection. Globally, coverage fell by 5% to 81% last year.
The number of “zero-dose” children, who did not receive any vaccinations, rose by 37% between 2019 and 2021, from 13 to 18 million children mostly in low and middle-income countries, the data showed.
For many diseases, more than 90% of children need to be vaccinated in order to prevent outbreaks. There have already been reports of rising cases of vaccine-preventable diseases in recent months, including a 400% rise in measles cases in Africa in 2022.
In 2021, 24.7 million children missed their first dose of measles vaccine, and a further 14.7 million did not get the essential second dose, the data showed. Coverage was 81%, the lowest since 2008.

According to the World Health Organization’s most recent report, it was behind 52% of cases sequenced in late June, up from 37% in one week. In the United States, it is estimated to be causing around 65% of infections.
BA.5 is not new. First identified in January, it has been tracked by the WHO since April.
It is a sister variant of the Omicron strain that has been dominant worldwide since the end of 2021, and has already caused spikes in case rates – even with reduced testing – in countries including South Africa, where it was first found, as well as the United Kingdom, parts of Europe, and Australia.
Coronavirus cases worldwide have now been rising for four weeks in a row, WHO data showed.
Like its closely related sibling, BA.4, BA.5 is particularly good at evading the immune protection afforded either by vaccination or prior infection.
For this reason, “BA.5 has a growth advantage over the other sublineages of Omicron that are circulating,” Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on COVID-19, told a news briefing on Tuesday.
For many people, this means that they are getting re-infected, often even a short time after having COVID-19. Van Kerkhove said the WHO is assessing reports of re-infections.
“We have ample evidence that people who’ve been infected with Omicron are getting infected with BA.5. No question about it,” said Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
If that seems particularly common now, it could be simply because so many people got Omicron, researchers have suggested.
While rising cases have caused more hospitalizations in some countries, deaths have not gone up dramatically.
This is largely because vaccines continue to protect against severe illness and death, if not infection, and manufacturers and regulators are also looking at tweaked vaccines that directly target the newer Omicron variants.
There is also no evidence that BA.5 is more dangerous than any of the other Omicron variants, the WHO’s Van Kerkhove stressed, although spikes in cases can put health services under pressure and risk more people getting long COVID.
The WHO and other experts have also said that the ongoing pandemic – prolonged by vaccine inequity and the desire in many countries to “move beyond” COVID-19 – would only lead to more new and unpredictable variants.
Scientists are already drawing attention to BA.2.75, first identified in India, which has a large number of mutations and is spreading fast.
The WHO said on Tuesday that the pandemic remained a global health emergency, and countries should consider public health measures like masking and social distancing when cases surge, alongside vaccinations.
“What people fundamentally don’t understand is that when there is this high level of community transmission, this will mutate,” Poland said. “Who knows what’s going to come next. We are playing with fire.”",Reuters,"Jul 13, 2022 9:46 PM PHT"

The world’s population, estimated to reach 8 billion by November 15 this year, could grow to 8.5 billion in 2030, and 10.4 billion in 2100, as the pace of mortality slows, said the report released on World Population Day.
India’s population was 1.21 billion in 2011, according to the domestic census, which is conducted once a decade. The government had deferred the 2021 census due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The world’s population was growing at its slowest pace since 1950, having fallen below 1% in 2020, UN estimates showed.
In 2021, the average fertility of the world’s population stood at 2.3 births per woman over a lifetime, having fallen from about 5 births in 1950. Global fertility is projected to decline further to 2.1 births per woman by 2050.
“This is an occasion to celebrate our diversity, recognize our common humanity, and marvel at advancements in health that have extended lifespans and dramatically reduced maternal and child mortality rates,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement.
Still, a growing population was a reminder of a shared responsibility of care for the planet and to “reflect on where we still fall short of our commitments to one another,” he said.
Referring to an earlier World Health Organization report- estimating about 14.9 million deaths relating to the COVID-19 pandemic between January 2020 and December 2021, the UN report said global life expectancy at birth fell to 71 years in 2021 from 72.8 years in 2019, mostly due to the pandemic.
The United Nations said more than half of the projected increase in the global population up to 2050 will be concentrated in eight countries – Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania.
Countries of sub-Saharan Africa are expected to contribute more than half of the increase anticipated through 2050.

The SKYCovione vaccine was authorized for a two-dose regimen on people aged 18 or older, with shots given four weeks apart, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.
In a phase III clinical trial of 4,037 adults, SKYCovione induced neutralizing antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 parental strain, SK bioscience said in a statement.
It is not yet known how effective it is against Omicron and other COVID variants.
The vaccine was jointly developed by the University of Washington’s Institute for Protein Design, with the support of global drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).
SK bioscience said it would seek authorizations for distribution of SKYCovione in other countries and through global vaccine sharing facility COVAX, and for emergency use listing at the World Health Organization.
South Korean authorities have agreed a 200 billion won ($155 million) deal to buy 10 million doses of the vaccine, which can be stored under normal refrigeration conditions, and previously said they expected it to be rolled out from the second half of the year.

Cannabis has long been the world’s most widely used drug and that use is increasing while the cannabis on the market is getting stronger in terms of its tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in its annual World Drug Report.
Various US states have legalized non-medical use of cannabis, starting with Washington and Colorado in 2012. Uruguay legalized it in 2013, as did Canada in 2018. Others have taken similar steps but the report focused on those three countries.
“Cannabis legalization appears to have accelerated the upwards trends in reported daily use of the drug,” the Vienna-based UNODC’s report said.
While the prevalence of cannabis use among teenagers “has not changed much”, there had been “a pronounced increase in reported frequent use of high-potency products among young adults”, it said.
“The proportion of people with psychiatric disorders and suicides associated with regular cannabis use has increased.”
The report said roughly 284 million people, or 5.6% of the world’s population, had used a drug such as heroin, cocaine, amphetamines or ecstasy in 2020, the most recent data available. Of those, 209 million used cannabis.
“Periods of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic drove increases in the use of cannabis … in 2020,” it said.

Advisors to the US Food and Drug Administration are scheduled to meet on Tuesday, June 28, to discuss whether to update COVID-19 vaccines for the fall. The updated shots are likely to be redesigned to combat the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, experts say.
Pfizer and BioNTech said that 30 and 60 microgram doses of a shot targeting just the BA.1 Omicron subvariant that was circulating last winter elicited a 13.5 and 19.6-fold increase in neutralizing geometric titers against that subvariant.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/predictable-consistent-parental-behavior-key-for-optimal-child-brain-development/,Predictable and consistent parental behavior is key for optimal child brain dev’t,"Scientists have long known that the experiences you have during infancy and childhood play an important role in shaping how your brain matures and how you behave as an adult. But figuring out why this happens has been difficult.
Over the past 15 years, my team and I have been studying child brain development to identify what aspects of early life experiences affect brain maturation. In our recently published paper summarizing our findings across multiple studies in animals and people, we found that unpredictable or inconsistent parental behavior can disrupt the development of a child’s emotional brain circuits. This can lead to an increased risk of mental illness and substance abuse later on in the child’s life.
To tackle the challenge of figuring out what signals affect how the brain’s emotional systems develop, we took cues from how the brain’s sensory systems, like vision and hearing, develop. Environmental signals are important to sensory development. For example, if an infant is unable to see adequately because of a severe lazy eye, they may develop lifelong vision deficits. Similarly, an infant who is unable to make out the patterns and sequences of everyday sound due to frequent ear infections may develop lifelong hearing problems.
Because parents are often the primary source of the information an infant and young child receives from their environment, we thought it would be reasonable to assume that parental signals would be crucial to brain development. Previous research over the decades have found that a caretaker’s behaviors and how responsive they were to their child’s needs were important to the child’s emotional growth. An absence of responses, such as from neglect, was associated with increased risk for emotional problems later in life.
While many studies have focused on the effects of “positive” or “negative” parental behaviors on child brain development, researchers have paid little attention to patterns of behavior, or a parent’s predictability and consistency. A parent who is predictable and consistent is one who reacts to new situations, such as when their child has a mild fall or asks for a new toy, in the same way. In the long term, predictability also means that a child knows who will pick them up from school and when they can expect lunch, dinner or bedtime.
We first conducted our studies in mice and rats to be able to control how the mothers behaved toward their pups by limiting the amount of material available in the environment for nest building, altering their activity patterns toward their offspring. We then conducted studies in people, observing how mothers behaved in structured play sessions and how the patterns of their actions influenced the emotional and cognitive development of their children.
To quantify maternal behaviors in these sessions, we measured the degree that one behavior predicted the next. For example, how likely a mother was to speak to and show her child a toy was a good predictor of how often she would pick her child up. We also controlled for other aspects of parenting and environment, such as socioeconomic status. We assessed child and pup development by administering cognitive and emotional tests, as well as behavioral questionnaires for the children.
Across all our animal and human studies, we found that predictable parental behavior patterns led to better emotional and cognitive functioning in their children later in life. While our studies have focused primarily on mothers, it is very likely that the same principles apply to fathers as well.
Our findings suggest it’s not just “positive” or “negative” parenting that affects a child’s development. It’s just as important for a child’s emotional brain development that their parents nurture them in predictable and consistent ways.
There are many adversities beyond a parent’s control that can impact their developing a child, such as poverty, war and migration. However, being aware of the role that predictable and consistent behavior plays in brain development can help parents create an optimal environment for their child as they grow emotionally. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/things-to-know-blue-light-skin-damage/,Blue light: What we do and don’t know about the damage it causes our skin,"Take a wander down the skincare aisle of any health and beauty retailer and you’ll be met with a bewildering array of creams and sprays, promising to protect you from various threats to your skin.
You might have noticed skincare companies claiming their products can protect you from the effects of blue light. If you hadn’t thought about blue light before, you’d be forgiven for worrying about whether you should be concerned.
First you need to understand what blue light is.
Visible light accounts for 50% of the sunlight spectrum and, as the name suggests, it’s the only part of light that can be detected by the human eye. The blue band of this visible spectrum has a particularly high energy level.
The longer the wavelength, the less energy it transmits. Blue light has very short, high energy waves.
Blue light is all around you. The sun emits blue light. So do fluorescent and incandescent light bulbs, mobile phones, computer screens, and flat screen televisions.
There is mounting evidence that blue light can have a harmful effect on the skin and eyes and disrupt the circadian rhythm (your internal clock). Typically, studies investigating the impact of sun radiation on the skin have focused on ultraviolet radiation, particularly UVB, which is responsible for sunburn. The most frequently reported effect of blue light exposure is a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), highly reactive chemicals formed from oxygen. Too much ROS can damage your DNA and key enzymes such as those responsible for DNA repair, increasing your risk of cancer.
Our research showed blue light can induce pigmentation (tanning) across skin types. While many people consider a deep tan a desirable trait, it is a marker of skin damage and ROS. Others researchers found skin tans from visible light (which includes blue light) had darker pigmentation that lasted longer compared to ultraviolet radiation exposure. Our studies also showed blue light can activate genes associated with inflammation and photoageing (skin damge). Several studies have proved typical sunscreens do not prevent blue and visible light damage.
While blue light appears to be less potent than ultraviolet radiation, this may be accounted for by the relatively larger amounts of blue light that reach the Earth. UVR accounts for around 5% of solar radiation in the UK at midday in the summer. Blue light makes up around three times more at 15%.
There are some beneficial effects of blue light. It has been used to treat skin conditions including eczema, it is widely used in photodynamic therapy, which is used to treat a range of skins conditions, from acne to cancer, and it boosts wound healing. But the harmful effects of blue light are likely to outweigh the positives for healthy people.
Blue light can damage the skin but it’s less clear which sources of blue light are harmful to humans. The blue light from screens is responsible for a fraction of the blue light doses we get. Research has shown screens from devices can increase ROS production. However, a study by German skincare manufacturer Biersdorf found that an entire week’s worth exposure to blue light from a screen at a distance of 30 cm is equivalent to just one minute of midday summer sun in Hamburg, Germany. Another study found blue light from screens were 100 to 1,000 times less intense than blue light from the sun. It also failed to trigger melasma, which causes patches of skin discoloration, in patients who have the condition. It’s true we are spending more time in front of screens than ever before but while screens may cause some damage, it’s insignificant compared with sun exposure.
The cosmetics industry has started developing a wide range of skincare products that brands claim prevent blue light damage. However, there is no regulated or standardized test to assess a product’s ability to prevent blue light damage. Companies do carry out scientific tests on these products. But they can use any number of assessments in their work. This is very different from the regulations around sunscreen that claim to contain sun protection factor (SPF). SPF testing is closely regulated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). All products that claim to contain an SPF undergo an identical testing regime.
The lack of regulation for blue light claims makes it impossible for consumers to make informed choices about the level of protection offered and differences between products. This lack of regulation is unlikely to be dangerous for consumers, but the benefit from the products may be limited. Given the evidence around blue light emitted by screens, it’s worth applying scepticism to any claims that a product is needed to prevent damage from your computer screen or phone.
Traditional photoprotection products (such as sunscreens) don’t typically protect you from blue light damage. It’s encouraging the skincare industry is trying to address this need. But it is crucial that governments take the next step in the process and develop industry-wide, standardized testing. In the meantime, it is important to remember to limit any exposure to the sun. The use of sunscreens (or any product containing an SPF rating) have been proven to prevent skin cancer and photoageing, and products advertising blue light protection may give an additional benefit. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

The following are some details about the two messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines from Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc /BioNTech SE for young children:
Moderna’s vaccine is a two-dose regimen in children aged 6 months to 6 years old. The 25-microgram doses are given 28 days apart. Adults received 100 micrograms per shot for their first two doses.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is a three-dose course for children aged 6 months to under 5 years old. The first two doses are given 21 days apart and the third is administered at least two months after the second. Each dose is 3 micrograms, below the 10 micrograms given to children aged 5 to 11 and 30 micrograms for people aged 12 and older.
Both companies had sought lower-dose versions for younger children to try to reduce side effects.
Moderna’s vaccine was estimated to be 50.6% effective at preventing symptomatic infections among children 6 months to under 2 years old and 36.8% effective at doing so in children ages 2 to 6 in a clinical trial of over 5,000 subjects.
It is not yet known how effective the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is at preventing infection in people under age 5 because of the low number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases among the children in its trial. An early analysis based on 10 symptomatic COVID-19 cases suggested a vaccine efficacy of 80.3% in this group. Once 21 children in the trial contract symptomatic COVID-19, the companies can finalize the vaccine’s efficacy.
Both the company’s trials showed that the vaccines generated a similar immune response to those seen in older age groups.
Neither vaccine has raised any serious safety issues in the trials.
Heart inflammation known as myocarditis and pericarditis has been found to be a rare side effect of the vaccines in young men, but there have been few cases reported in the United States in children ages 5 to 11, and none in either of these trials for the youngest age group.
Some children reported pain and swelling at the injection site after vaccination from both vaccines.
Pfizer’s low-dose vaccine was generally better tolerated, with only sightly more participants who received the vaccine complaining of fevers, irritability or fatigue when compared with those who received a placebo. In ages 2 to 4, 33.7% of participants who received their second dose of the vaccine reported one of these side effects, compared to 32.2% who received placebo.
For Moderna’s vaccine, 58.9% of 3 to 5 year olds reported some type of reaction like fever, headache or fatigue after receiving their second dose, compared with 37.2% of participants who received placebo.
COVID-19 is generally milder in children than adults, but there have been more than 440 US COVID deaths among those under age 5, according to FDA officials.
Data has shown that in older children and adults, vaccines protect against hospitalization and death, according to Dr. Matthew Harris, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at  Northwell Health in New York.
People who had a COVID-19 infection and received a booster shot had the most protection against COVID-19, he said.
Vaccines will be available in pediatrician offices, children’s hospitals, health clinics, and pharmacies.
Not all pharmacies will offer the shots for this group and some will only provide them for children older than three. CVS Health Corporation, for instance, will offer shots for children aged 18 months, while Walmart Inc and Rite Aid Corp have said they would make them available for those 3 and older.",Reuters,"Jun 21, 2022 9:36 PM PHT"

The study comes as China, which has approved only locally developed COVID-19 shots including the Sinopharm vaccine, strives to improve vaccination rates, maintaining a “dynamic zero COVID-19” policy aimed at eradicate all outbreaks while many countries have adopted an approach of learning to live with the virus.
The vaccine, BBIBP-CorV, is one of the two Sinopharm COVID-19 shots approved for use in China, and is also the main shot that the state-owned firm has exported.
Among 25 individuals who received two doses of BBIBP-CorV vaccine, the neutralizing activity against sub-variants such as BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 “was not or only minimally detectable,” researchers said in correspondence published on Monday, June 20.
Neutralizing activity against those sub-variants was observed in just 24-48% of subjects who received a BBIBP-CorV booster shot after the two-dose product, researchers said, citing results from a group of 25 participants.
The rate improved slightly, to 30-53%, for those who received a third shot made by a unit of Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products 300122.SZ, another vaccine approved for use in China, according to data from another group of 30 subjects.
The study did not discuss the boosters’ efficacy, a rate that reflects how well they could lower the risk of COVID-19 disease or death, which is usually observed in large clinical trials.",Reuters,"Jun 21, 2022 12:18 PM PHT"

The agency authorized Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine for children aged 6 months to 4 years, and Moderna Inc’s shot for those 6 months to 17 years. The Pfizer vaccine is already authorized for use in children and teens over the age of 5.
The vaccines could be rolled out for the under-5 age groups as early as next week, White House officials have said, and pharmacy chains have conveyed that they are ready to distribute the shots.
An advisory panel of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which first needs to make its recommendation on the use of the shots, is scheduled to meet on Friday and Saturday.
While many American parents are eager to vaccinate their children, its unclear how strong the demand will be for the shots. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was authorized for children ages 5 to 11 in October, but only about 29% of that group is fully vaccinated, according to federal data.
“Those trusted with the care of children can have confidence in the safety and effectiveness of these COVID-19 vaccines and can be assured that the agency was thorough in its evaluation of the data,” FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement.
Public health officials and experts say that even though a large portion of small children were infected during the winter surge due to the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, natural immunity wanes over time and vaccinations should help prevent hospitalizations and deaths when cases rise again.

Researchers at King’s College London, using data from the ZOE COVID Symptom study app, found the odds of developing long COVID after infection were 20% to 50% lower during the Omicron wave in the UK compared to Delta. The figure varied depending on the patient’s age and the timing of their last vaccination.
Long COVID, which includes prolonged symptoms ranging from fatigue to “brain fog,” can be debilitating and continue for weeks or months. It is increasingly being recognized as a public health problem, and researchers have been racing to find out if Omicron presents as big a risk of long COVID as previously dominant variants.
The study from King’s is believed to be the first academic research to show Omicron does not present as great a risk of long COVID, but that does not mean long COVID patient numbers are dropping, the team said.
While the risk of long COVID was lower during Omicron, more people were infected, so the absolute number now suffering is higher.
“It’s good news, but please don’t decommission any of your long COVID services,” lead researcher Dr Claire Steves told Reuters, appealing to health-service providers.
The UK’s Office for National Statistics said in May that 438,000 people in the country have long COVID after Omicron infection, representing 24% of all long COVID patients.
It also said the risk of lingering symptoms after Omicron was lower than with Delta, but only for double-vaccinated people. It found no statistical difference for those who were triple vaccinated.
In the King’s research, 4.5% of the 56,003 people studied during Omicron’s peak, December 2021-March 2022, reported long COVID. That compared to 10.8% of 41,361 people during the Delta wave, June-November 2021. It did not compare vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.
While the study – published in The Lancet journal on Thursday – compared Delta and Omicron, Dr. Steves said previous work had showed no substantial difference in long COVID risk between other variants.
More work was needed to establish why Omicron may have a lower long COVID risk, the team added.",Reuters,"Jun 17, 2022 7:26 AM PHT"

The following are some important details to know about these two messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines for this age group.
Moderna has asked the FDA to authorize a two-dose regimen of its vaccine in children aged 6 months to 6 years old. The 25-microgram doses are given 28 days apart. Adults received 100 micrograms per shot for their the first two doses.
Pfizer and BioNTech are asking for a three-dose course of their vaccine for children aged 6 months to under 5 years old. The first two doses are given 21 days apart and the third is administered at least two months after the second. Each dose is 3 micrograms, below the 10 micrograms given to children aged 5 to 11 and 30 micrograms for people aged 12 and older.
Both companies sought lower-dose versions for younger children to try to reduce vaccine side effects.
Moderna’s vaccine was estimated to be 50.6% effective at preventing symptomatic infections among children 6 months to under 2 years old and 36.8% effective at doing so in children ages 2 to 6 in a clinical trial of over 5,000 subjects.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/world-health-organization-looks-reports-monkeypox-virus-in-semen/,WHO looks into reports of monkeypox virus in semen,"LONDON, United Kingdom – The World Health Organization (WHO) is looking into reports that the monkeypox virus is present in the semen of patients, exploring the possibility that the disease could be sexually transmitted, a WHO official said on Wednesday, June 15.
Many cases in the current monkeypox outbreak, largely centered on Europe, are among sexual partners who have had close contact, and the agency reiterated that virus is mainly transmitted via close interpersonal contact.
In recent days, scientists say they have detected viral DNA in the semen of a handful of monkeypox patients in Italy and Germany, including a lab-tested sample that suggested the virus found in the semen of a single patient was capable of infecting another person and replicating.
Catherine Smallwood, monkeypox incident manager at WHO/Europe, said it was not known whether recent reports meant the monkeypox virus could be sexually transmitted.
“This may have been something that we were unaware of in this disease before,” she told a press briefing.
“We really need to focus on the most frequent mode of transmission and we clearly see that to be associated with skin to skin contact.”
More than 1,300 cases of the viral disease have been reported by about 30 countries since early May. Most cases have been reported in men who have sex with men.
The outbreak has triggered concern since the virus is rarely seen outside of Africa, where it is endemic, and the majority of the European cases are not related to travel to the continent.
As the outbreak spreads, the WHO has recommended targeted vaccination of close contacts, including healthcare workers, but has warned it is already seeing a rush to stockpile vaccines.
“Once again, a ‘me first’ approach could lead to damaging consequences down the road,” said Hans Kluge, WHO’s regional director for Europe.

The agency, however, said the findings on myocarditis and pericarditis, types of heart inflammation linked to both the mRNA shots, were not consistent across all of the US vaccine safety monitoring systems.
The CDC’s analysis comes as the US Food and Drug Administration’s advisers meet on Tuesday to discuss the authorization of Moderna’s vaccine for children and teens aged 6-17.
Based on data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) system, the incidence of heart inflammation was 97.3 cases per million doses for males aged 18-39 following a second dose of Moderna’s shot, versus 81.7 cases per million Pfizer vaccine doses.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-studies-diabetes-pregnant-patients-june-2022/,Diabetes may increase long COVID-19 risk; COVID while pregnant linked to baby brain dev’t issues,"The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Diabetes may increase the risk of long COVID, new analyses of seven previous studies suggest.
Researchers reviewed studies that tracked people for at least four weeks after COVID-19 recovery to see which individuals developed persistent symptoms associated with long COVID such as brain fog, skin conditions, depression, and shortness of breath. In three of the studies, people with diabetes were up to four times more likely to develop long COVID compared to people without diabetes, according to a presentation on Sunday at the annual Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association. The researchers said diabetes appears to be “a potent risk factor” for long COVID but their findings are preliminary because the studies used different methods, definitions of long COVID, and follow-up times, and some looked at hospitalized patients while others focused on people with milder cases of COVID-19.
“More high-quality studies across multiple populations and settings are needed to determine if diabetes is indeed a risk factor” for long COVID, the researchers said. “In the meantime, careful monitoring of people with diabetes…may be advised” after COVID-19.
Babies born to mothers who had COVID-19 while pregnant may be at higher than average risk for problems with brain development involved in learning, focusing, remembering, and developing social skills, researchers have found.
They studied 7,772 infants delivered in Massachusetts between March and September 2020, tracking the babies until age 12 months. During that time, 14.4% of the babies born to the 222 women with a positive coronavirus test during pregnancy were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder, compared to 8.7% of babies whose mothers avoided the virus while pregnant. After accounting for other neurodevelopmental risk factors, including preterm delivery, SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was linked with an 86% higher risk of a neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosis in offspring, the researchers reported on Thursday, June 9, in JAMA Network Open. The risk was more than doubled when the infection occurred in the third trimester.
The researchers point out that their study was brief and cannot rule out the possibility that additional neurodevelopmental effects will become apparent as the children grow up. On the other hand, they note, larger and more rigorous studies are needed to rule out other potential causes and prove that the coronavirus is to blame.
The rare but life-threatening inflammatory syndrome seen in some children after a coronavirus infection has become even more rare with the Omicron variant causing most infections and more kids vaccinated, according to a new study.
Researchers looked at data from Denmark on more than half a million children and adolescents infected after Omicron became dominant, about half of whom experienced breakthrough infections after vaccination. Overall, only one vaccinated child and 11 unvaccinated children developed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), which causes inflammation in the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain after a mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. That translates to rates of 34.9 MIS-C cases per million unvaccinated children with COVID-19 and 3.7 cases per million vaccinated young COVID-19 patients, the researchers said on Wednesday in JAMA Pediatrics. By comparison, rates of MIS-C cases when Delta was predominant were 290.7 per million unvaccinated infected kids and 101.5 per million among the vaccinated who had COVID, they said.
The fact that MIS-C risk was significantly lower in vaccinated children suggests the vaccine is helping to keep the immune system from causing the deadly inflammatory reaction that is an MIS-C hallmark, the researchers said.",Reuters,"Jun 10, 2022 12:29 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/pandemic-origins-obscured-lack-chinese-data-who-panel/,Pandemic’s origins obscured by lack of Chinese data – WHO panel,"LONDON, UK – The World Health Organization said on Thursday, June 9, its latest investigation into the origins of COVID-19 was inconclusive, largely because data from China is missing, another blow to its years-long effort to determine how the pandemic began.
The report from the WHO expert panel said all available data showed the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 probably came from animals, likely bats, a similar conclusion to the UN agency’s previous work on the topic in 2021 that followed a trip to China.
The missing data, especially from China, where the first cases were reported in December 2019, meant it was not possible to identify exactly how the virus was first transmitted to humans.
The findings are likely to add to doubts it will be possible to determine how and where the virus emerged.
They will also inject urgency into the effort to overhaul the WHO and its health emergency procedures as the agency strives to reassert itself after years of criticism over its handling of the pandemic.
The WHO says the report, the first of several expected from the panel, is also about drawing up a better way to probe the origins of future outbreaks.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote to the Chinese government twice in February this year in pursuit of more information, the report showed, although the authors also said China had provided some data on request.
The origins of the pandemic, which has killed at least 15 million people, have become politicized. Scientists say it is important to establish what happened to prevent similar outbreaks.
But the team on the panel – known as the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO) – said it was still impossible to do so because of a lack of data. They also say there are “recognized challenges” in investigating “such a long time after the initial outbreak”, although their work would continue.
“The longer it takes, the harder it becomes,” Maria Van Kerkhove, a senior WHO official on the SAGO secretariat, told a briefing, adding the WHO will support all ongoing efforts to better understand how the pandemic began.
“We owe it to ourselves, we owe to the millions of people who died and the billions of people who were infected,” she said.
The report said no new information had been provided on the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to humans through a laboratory incident, and “it remains important to consider all reasonable scientific data” to evaluate this possibility.
Reflecting the political wrangling that has dogged the drafting of the report, it includes a footnote outlining how members of the panel from Brazil, China and Russia disagreed that further studies were needed on the lab hypothesis and suggested nothing had changed since the previous WHO-China joint report on origins, published in March 2021.
The latest report also includes a framework for how to pinpoint the origins of future outbreaks, which WHO has said is the panel’s central aim, rather than drawing conclusions on COVID-19.
Jean-Claude Manuguerra, SAGO co-chair said monkeypox was an “illustration of how much we need this global framework” to find out how future pathogens emerge.
When the panel was set up in October, WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan said it was the “best chance… it may be our last chance” to understand the origins of the coronavirus.
The report also includes a long list of recommendations for further studies that could shed more light on COVID-19’s origins.
They include seeking information on the earliest cases in Wuhan, China, as well as further studies around the animal market in Wuhan that was identified early on as a potential location for the virus’s jump to humans.
The 2021 report called a lab leak “highly unlikely” and suggested the most plausible theory was a spillover from animals. A later US intelligence report said both theories remained plausible, although it too leaned towards natural origins.",Reuters,"Jun 9, 2022 10:45 PM PHT"

Twenty-nine countries have reported cases in the current outbreak, which began in May. None have reported deaths.
At a media briefing in Geneva, Tedros also said there had been more than 1,400 suspected cases of monkeypox this year in Africa and 66 deaths.
“It’s an unfortunate reflection of the world we live in that the international community is only now paying attention to monkeypox because it has appeared in high-income countries,” he said.
He said the outbreak was showing signs of community transmission in some countries. WHO recommends people with monkeypox isolate at home.
Rosamund Lewis, WHO technical lead on monkeypox, said that “interpersonal close contact” was the main way monkeypox spreads, although she added that the risk of aerosol transmission was not yet fully known. Health workers caring for monkeypox patients should wear a mask, she said.
Cases are still predominantly among men who have sex with men, the WHO added, although cases in women have been reported.
The UN agency is working with organizations including UN AIDS and community groups to raise awareness and stop transmission.
Post-exposure vaccination, including for health workers or close contacts, including sexual partners – ideally within four days of exposure – may be considered for some countries, WHO added.

The vaccine, which was given as a fourth dose in a trial that enrolled more than 800 people, raised virus-neutralizing antibodies by eight-fold against Omicron.
The company said it plans to submit data on the vaccine, which targets Omicron as well as the original coronavirus strain, to regulators in the coming weeks and the doses could be available to consumers in late summer, sending its shares up 3%.
Moderna president Stephen Hoge said the company was in touch with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulators on the design of the study, which should make the filings a smooth process.
“We expect those to be relatively straightforward discussions and submissions,” he said.
It is not known if countries including the United States will adopt annual fall boosters, similar to the flu market.
“The data look quite comforting and convincing,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

More than 300 suspected and confirmed cases of monkeypox, a usually mild illness that spreads through close contact causing flu-like symptoms and a distinctive rash, have been reported in May, mostly in Europe.
The WHO is considering whether the outbreak should be assessed as a “potential public health emergency of international concern” or PHEIC. Such a declaration, as was done for COVID-19 and Ebola, would help accelerate research and funding to contain the disease.
Asked whether this monkeypox outbreak has the potential to grow into a pandemic, Rosamund Lewis, technical lead for monkeypox from the WHO Health Emergencies Program said: “We don’t know but we don’t think so.”
“At the moment, we are not concerned of a global pandemic,” she added.
The strain of virus implicated in the outbreak is understood to kill a small fraction of those infected, but no deaths have been reported so far.
Most cases have cropped up in Europe rather than in the Central and West African countries where the virus is endemic, and are predominantly not linked to travel.
Scientists are therefore looking into what might explain this unusual upsurge of cases, while public health authorities suspect there is some degree of community transmission.

“The public health risk could become high if this virus exploits the opportunity to establish itself as a human pathogen and spreads to groups at higher risk of severe disease such as young children and immunosuppressed persons,” WHO said.
As of May 26, a total of 257 confirmed cases and 120 suspected cases have been reported from 23 member states that are not endemic for the virus, the health agency said in a statement. There has been no reported fatalities so far.
WHO also said that the sudden appearance of monkeypox at once in several non-endemic countries suggests undetected transmission for some time and recent amplifying events.
The agency added that it expects more cases to be reported as surveillance in endemic and non-endemic countries expands.
Monkeypox is an infectious disease that is usually mild, and is endemic in parts of west and central Africa. It is spread by close contact, so it can be relatively easily contained through measures such as self-isolation and hygiene.

“We think that if we put in place the right measures now we probably can contain this easily,” Sylvie Briand, WHO director for Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness, told the U agency’s annual assembly.
Monkeypox is a usually mild viral infection that is endemic in parts of west and central Africa.
It spreads chiefly through close contact and until the recent outbreak, was rarely seen in other parts of the world, which is why the recent emergence of cases in Europe, the United States and other areas has raised alarms.
So far, there are about 300 confirmed or suspected cases in around 20 countries where the virus was not previously circulating.
“For us, we think that the key priority currently is trying to contain this transmission in non-endemic countries,” Briand told a technical briefing for member states.
Needed measures included the early detection and isolation of cases and contact tracing, she added.
Member states should also share information about first generation stockpiles of smallpox vaccines which can also be effective against monkeypox, Briand said.
“We don’t know exactly the number of doses available in the world and so that’s why we encourage countries to come to WHO and tell us what are their stockpiles,” she said. A slide of her presentation described global supplies as “very constrained.”
Currently, WHO officials are advising against mass vaccination, instead suggesting targeted vaccination where available for close contacts of people infected.

Fully vaccinated individuals who get infected with the coronavirus spread the infection to fewer people and are contagious for less time compared to people who are partially vaccinated or unvaccinated, a small study from South Korea suggests.
In 173 hospital workers with COVID-19, including 50 who had breakthrough infections, researchers found that the virus had been transmitted to others in the hospital by 7% of the vaccinated group compared with 26% of the unvaccinated, even though the two groups had similar viral loads when diagnosed. In a separate group of 45 people with mild COVID-19 who were being quarantined, the researchers observed shedding of infectious virus particles for four days in the six people who had been fully vaccinated, 8 days in the 11 partially vaccinated people, and 10 days in the 28 unvaccinated people. All of the infections were acquired before the Omicron variant was circulating, the researchers noted on Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.
“Data from this study provide important evidence that despite the possibility of breakthrough infections, COVID-19 vaccinations remain critically useful for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2,” the researchers said.
COVID-19 vaccines are effective in most cancer patients, but less so than in the general population and the efficacy wanes more quickly, according to a large study.
When the Delta variant of the coronavirus was predominant in the UK, researchers tracked 377,194 individuals with cancer and more than 28 million people without malignancies. After two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer PFE.N/BioNTech 22UAy.DE or AstraZeneca AZN.L, overall vaccine effectiveness against infection was 69.8% in the general population and only slightly lower, at 65.5%, for cancer patients, the researchers reported on Monday in The Lancet Oncology. Three to six months later, however, vaccine effectiveness was 61.4% in the general population but had dropped to 47% in the cancer group. The vaccines were 83.3% effective against COVID-related hospitalization and 93.4% effective against death for cancer patients, but this protection also waned within three to six months, the researchers said. Vaccine effectiveness was lowest and waned most quickly in people with lymphoma or leukemia. In cancer patients who had received chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the past 12 months, vaccine effectiveness was lower and waned faster than in cancer patients who did not receive treatments within the past year.
“This study…highlights the importance of vaccination booster programs and rapid access to COVID-19 treatments for people undergoing cancer treatments,” study leader Peter Johnson of the University of Southampton said in a statement.
In people with lasting breathlessness after COVID-19, a special type of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals lung abnormalities that traditional imaging techniques do not detect, a small study shows.
In 23 patients with shortness of breath lasting for months after COVID-19, including 11 who had not required hospitalization, the researchers performed hyperpolarized xenon 129MRI, or Hp-XeMRI, to look for abnormalities in gas exchange – the way oxygen and carbon dioxide move between the lungs and the blood. All participants had normal or near normal CT scans and lung function tests, but in both groups, Hp-XeMRI showed abnormalities in gas transfer, the research team reported on Tuesday in Radiology. They cannot explain the abnormalities, and they do not know for sure yet whether the abnormalities are actually contributing to patients’ symptoms. But shortness of breath is among the most common symptoms reported by people with long COVID, and the researchers hope the findings in this small study will be a clue to the cause.
“Using Hp-XeMRI may enable us to further understand the cause of breathlessness in long COVID patients, and ultimately lead to better treatments to improve this often debilitating symptom,” study co-author James Grist from the University of Oxford said in a statement.",Reuters,"May 27, 2022 7:27 AM PHT"

Dozens of individuals have reported rebounding COVID symptoms on social media or to the US Food and Drug Administration after taking Paxlovid, but Pfizer suggests the experience is rare. A recent rise in COVID cases has driven up use of therapeutics in the country.
The CDC said in its advisory that case reports suggest that recurrence results in mild symptoms, and there have been no reports of severe disease so far. The agency still continues to recommend the oral antiviral drug as a treatment, despite the possibility of recurrences.
A brief return of symptoms may be part of the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection in some persons, regardless of treatment with Paxlovid, the agency said.
CDC recommends that patients with COVID rebound can end their re-isolation period after five full days if there is no fever for 24 hours and symptoms improve, but such patients should wear a mask for a total of 10 days after rebound symptoms begin.",Reuters,"May 24, 2022 11:51 PM PHT"

While the outbreak is unusual, it remains “containable” and limited, the WHO said, and it is convening further meetings to support member states with more advice on how to tackle the situation.
Monkeypox is a usually mild viral infection that is endemic in parts of west and central Africa. It spreads chiefly through close contact, and until the recent outbreak has only rarely been seen in other parts of the world. The majority of the recent cases have been reported in Europe.
“We encourage you all to increase the surveillance of monkeypox to see where transmission levels are and understand where it is going,” said Sylvie Briand, WHO director for Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness.
She said it was unclear if the cases were the “tip of the iceberg” or if the peak in transmission has already passed.
Speaking at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, Briand reiterated WHO’s view that it is unlikely that the virus has mutated but said that transmission may be being driven by a change in human behavior, particularly as people return to socializing as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted worldwide.
Many, but not all, of the cases have been reported in men who have sex with men, and Briand said it was particularly important to try to prevent sexual transmission.
Symptoms include a fever and a distinctive bumpy rash. The West African strain of monkeypox, which is the one identified in the current outbreak, has a mortality rate of around 1%.
While she said the outbreak was “not normal”, she stressed that it was “containable”. There are also vaccines and treatments available for monkeypox, she added, calling for appropriate containment measures, more research, and global collaboration.

Now it has 80,000.","TAIPEI, Taiwan – Billed a COVID-19 success story as its economy boomed through the pandemic, Taiwan is now battling a record wave of infections as it eases restrictions that had kept outbreaks at bay to start life with the virus.
For the whole of 2021, Taiwan reported less than 15,000 locally transmitted cases. Now, it’s registering around 80,000 cases a day – a startling reversal after the effectiveness of its long-standing zero-COVID policy won it international praise.
“We could no longer achieve the goal of zero COVID because it was too contagious,” former vice president Chen Chien-jen, an epidemiologist, said in a video released by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party on Sunday. Most cases in Taiwan are of the less severe Omicron variant, with more than 99.7% of cases exhibiting mild or no symptoms, he said.
“This is a crisis but also an opportunity, allowing us to walk out of the shadow of COVID-19 quickly,” Chen said.
Despite a peak of infection forecast for this week, the government is determined to end a policy that included largely closing its borders. It has relaxed restrictions, such as shortening mandatory quarantines, in what it calls the “new Taiwan model” – gradually living with the virus and avoiding shutting down the economy.
Unlike some countries where new case spikes overwhelmed medical systems and disrupted everyday life, Taiwan hospital beds earmarked for COVID patients are at 56% occupancy. Shops, restaurants and gyms remain open, and gatherings continue, with mandatory mask-wearing.
Still, the island of 23.5 million people is recording 40 to 50 deaths a day, bringing its year-to-date total to 625 deaths.
Deaths stood at 838 from 2020 through to end-2021.
Taiwan’s approach stands in contrast with China, where strict measures to control outbreaks have led to the prolonged lockdown of Shanghai – a city of 25 million people – and movement curbs in numerous cities including Beijing.
Former vice president Chen said Taiwan would be ready to reopen to tourists when 75-80% of the population had received a third vaccination shot. The rate currently stands at 64%.
Taiwan is focusing on eliminating serious illness while easing disruptions, allowing milder cases to see doctors online with home delivery of oral antiviral products.
Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said on Monday that Taiwan aims to keep the death rate below 0.1%. The current rate is around 0.06% and rising slowly.
Opposition parties said the government was ill-prepared, citing an initial shortage of home rapid test kits when cases started spiking last month, and criticized it for moving too slowly to secure vaccines for children under 12.
The surge in cases is now sparking new precautions. Starting this week, classes in Taipei schools were moved online while subway ridership has fallen to about half average levels.
“Taiwan didn’t really have a choice. Naturally, we need to move on to coexist with the virus,” said Shih Hsin-ru, who leads the Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections at Taiwan’s Chang Gung University.
She said the government was not well prepared for the shift away from the zero COVID approach, pointing to the initial shortage of resources, from vaccines to antivirals. But things are looking better after what she described as a “scramble” by the government.
“We are slowly getting back on track,” she said. “We are likely to see less impact compared to neighboring countries.”",Reuters,"May 24, 2022 4:56 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/world-health-organization-expects-more-cases-monkeypox-emerge-globally/,WHO expects more cases of monkeypox to emerge globally,"The World Health Organization said it expects to identify more cases of monkeypox as it expands surveillance in countries where the disease is not typically found.
As of Saturday, May 21, 92 confirmed cases and 28 suspected cases of monkeypox have been reported from 12 member states that are not endemic for the virus, the UN agency said, adding it will provide further guidance and recommendations in coming days for countries on how to mitigate the spread of monkeypox.
“Available information suggests that human-to-human transmission is occurring among people in close physical contact with cases who are symptomatic,” the agency added.
Monkeypox is an infectious disease that is usually mild, and is endemic in parts of west and central Africa. It is spread by close contact, so it can be relatively easily contained through such measures as self-isolation and hygiene.
“What seems to be happening now is that it has got into the population as a sexual form, as a genital form, and is being spread as are sexually transmitted infections, which has amplified its transmission around the world,” WHO official David Heymann, an infectious disease specialist, told Reuters.
Heymann said an international committee of experts met via video conference to look at what needed to be studied about the outbreak and communicated to the public, including whether there is any asymptomatic spread, who are at most risk, and the various routes of transmission.
He said the meeting was convened “because of the urgency of the situation”. The committee is not the group that would suggest declaring a public health emergency of international concern, WHO’s highest form of alert, which applies to the COVID-19 pandemic.
He said close contact was the key transmission route, as lesions typical of the disease are very infectious. For example, parents caring for sick children are at risk, as are health workers, which is why some countries have started inoculating teams treating monkeypox patients using vaccines for smallpox, a related virus.
Many of the current cases have been identified at sexual health clinics.
Early genomic sequencing of a handful of the cases in Europe has suggested a similarity with the strain that spread in a limited fashion in Britain, Israel and Singapore in 2018.
Heymann said it was “biologically plausible” the virus had been circulating outside of the countries where it is endemic, but had not led to major outbreaks as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns, social distancing and travel restrictions.
He stressed that the monkeypox outbreak did not resemble the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic because it does not transmit as easily. Those who suspect they may have been exposed or who show symptoms including bumpy rash and fever, should avoid close contact with others, he said.
“There are vaccines available, but the most important message is, you can protect yourself,” he added.",Reuters,"May 22, 2022 1:08 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/who-emergency-meeting-monkeypox-may-20-2022/,WHO calls emergency meeting as monkeypox cases cross 100 in Europe,"LONDON, United Kingdom – The World Health Organization was due to hold an emergency meeting on Friday, May 20, to discuss the recent outbreak of monkeypox, a viral infection more common to west and central Africa, after more than 100 cases were confirmed or suspected in Europe.
In what Germany described as the largest-ever outbreak in Europe, cases have now been confirmed in at least five countries – the United Kingdom, Spain Portugal, Germany and Italy – as well as the United States, Canada and Australia.
First identified in monkeys, the disease typically spreads through close contact and has rarely spread outside Africa, so this series of cases has triggered concern.
However, scientists do not expect the outbreak to evolve into a pandemic like COVID-19, given the virus does not spread as easily as SARS-COV-2.
Monkeypox is usually a mild viral illness, characterized by symptoms of fever as well as a distinctive bumpy rash.
“With several confirmed cases in the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal, this is the largest and most widespread outbreak of monkeypox ever seen in Europe,” said Germany’s armed forces’ medical service, which detected its first case in the country on Friday.
Fabian Leendertz, from the Robert Koch Institute, described the outbreak as an epidemic.
“However it is very unlikely that this epidemic will last long. The cases can be well isolated via contact tracing and there are also drugs and effective vaccines that can be used if necessary,” he said.
There isn’t a specific vaccine for monkeypox, but data shows that vaccines that were used to eradicate smallpox are up to 85% effective against monkeypox, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
British authorities on Thursday, May 19, said they had offered a smallpox vaccine to some healthcare workers and others who may have been exposed to monkeypox.
The WHO committee due to meet is the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group on Infectious Hazards with Pandemic and Epidemic Potential (STAG-IH), which advises WHO on infection risks that could pose a threat to global health.
Since 1970, monkeypox cases have been reported in 11 African countries. Nigeria has had a large outbreak since 2017 – so far this year there have been 46 suspected cases, of which 15 have since been confirmed, according to the WHO.
The first European case was confirmed on May 7 in an individual who returned to England from Nigeria.
Since then, more than 100 cases have been confirmed outside Africa, according to a tracker by a University of Oxford academic.

Many of the cases are not linked to travel to the continent. As a result, the cause of this outbreak is unclear, although health authorities have said that there is potentially some degree of community spread.
In Britain, where 20 cases have been now confirmed, the UK Health Security Agency said the recent cases in the country were predominantly among men who self-identified as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men.
The 14 cases in Portugal that were all detected in sexual health clinics are also in men who self-identify as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men.
Health authorities in Spain said 23 new cases were confirmed on Friday, mainly in the Madrid region where most infections were linked to an outbreak in an adult sauna.
It was too early to say if the illness has morphed into a sexually transmitted disease, said Alessio D’Amato, health commissioner of the Lazio region in Italy. Three cases have been reported so far in the country.
Sexual contact, by definition, is close contact, added Stuart Neil, professor of virology at Kings College London.
“The idea that there’s some sort of sexual transmission in this, I think, is a little bit of a stretch,” he said.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/cancer-coalition-aims-to-boost-access-to-medicines-in-poorer-countries/,Cancer coalition aims to boost access to medicines in poorer countries,"LONDON, UK – Pharmaceutical companies including Novartis and Roche have teamed up with global cancer organizations in an alliance aimed at getting more oncology medications to poorer countries.
Currently, fewer than 50% of the cancer drugs on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) essential medicines list are available in low and middle income countries, and the disease burden is growing. Without action, almost three in four cancer deaths are set to occur in these settings in the next decade.
In the first concrete step for the Access to Oncology Medicines (ATOM) Coalition, Novartis has licensed its blood cancer drug nilotinib to the United Nations’ Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), allowing generic manufacturers to access the know-how to produce the drug at scale and at a lower cost.
Previously, the technology behind HIV drugs and COVID-19 has been shared in this way, but nilotinib is the first drug for a non-communicable disease in the pool, ATOM said.
It only has a year left on its patent, but Novartis’ head of global health Lutz Hegemann said generic manufacturers had signalled it was still worthwhile.
“I think in a year there’s a lot that you can try to test and this is not the only medicine that we would consider offering up,” he said in an interview.
The aim of the coalition is not just to provide the drugs but also support training, diagnostics and delivery to get them to patients, the Union for International Cancer Control – a key partner – said.
The coalition begins with $32 million from the private sector and will focus initially on capacity building activitiesin ten lower and middle income countries, developing existing initiatives.
The Access to Medicine Foundation, which has long called out the inequality in access to drugs and care, will collaborate with the group.
“You’ve got some of the top minds … the people with deep pockets, the shelves stocked with drugs …. We will be tracking progress on how this consortium delivers,” said Jayasree Iyer, director of the foundation.",Reuters,"May 20, 2022 4:18 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/explainer-agenda-of-the-world-health-assembly/,EXPLAINER: What is on (and off) the agenda of the WHO Assembly?,"GENEVA, Switerland – More than 100 world health ministers will meet in Geneva next week for the World Health Organization’s first in-person assembly in three years as the UN agency seeks to define its future role in global health policy.
The agenda of the World Health Assembly (WHA) is the most packed in the WHO’s 75-year history and is seen as an historic opportunity to move on from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to 15 million deaths, and prepare for the next global outbreak.
However, many of the most pressing topics, such as reforms of the rules around disease outbreaks, will be postponed for later or discussed only in the corridors.
Here’s a summary of what will and won’t be discussed:
Donors agreed a ‘pivotal’ deal last month to gradually raise their mandatory contributions to the WHO budget to reach 50% of the budget by 2028-2029 or 2030-31. In return, the WHO agreed to study their reform proposals.
Currently, their set fees represent just a fraction (16%) of the WHO’s total budget, which means it cannot fund someprograms since the money is earmarked for donors’ pet projects. The assembly is expected to approve the deal onTuesday.
WHO’s Ethiopian director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is all but certain to be reelected via a secret ballot on Tuesday, having overcome criticism from his own government and a crisis last year following sexual abuse reports against WHO staff in Congo.
During the assembly, Tedros is also set to renew the global health agency’s main “triple billion” goals that aim to boost universal health coverage, improve health and well-being and protect people better in health emergencies.
The WHO’s Europe region passed a resolution against Russia this month and asked Tedros to prepare a report on Ukraine’s health emergency.
Members are also preparing a resolution to be submitted to the assembly, although diplomats say it will stop short of suspending Russia’s voting rights, as some initially sought.
Reforms to the legally-binding rules that govern countries’ obligations on public health emergencies, the International Health Regulations (IHR), will be raised.
However, the focus will be on a US-led effort to expedite the application of future reforms from 24 months to 12 months, WHO principal legal officer Steve Solomon said.
Negotiations on other proposed changes will take place later amid initial opposition from some members, diplomats said.
The WHO tasked a scientific advisory panel with probing the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus after a preliminary investigation into early COVID-19 cases in China last year left some questions unanswered. A WHO spokesperson said the panel’s report was expected soon but would not be released as part of the assembly.
Most of the IHR reform negotiations will take place in the two years following the meeting, diplomats say.
These include sensitive items proposed by Washington like the deployment of expert teams to outbreak sites and a new compliance committee to monitor implementation of the rules, a WHO document showed.
Russia has also submitted reforms, diplomats say.
The IHR are widely seen as insufficient for dealing with a global pandemic and Tedros is seeking a new pandemic treaty.
Proposals for the new pact might include rules on vaccine-sharing and a proposed ban on wildlife markets.
Negotiations are set to continue in June and a final treaty, whose legal status is yet to be determined, would not be ready until 2024.
The G20 has agreed to set up a multi-billion dollar global fund for pandemic preparedness that will be set up outside of the WHO, probably at the World Bank. WHO’s role in the fund is still being decided and it is not on the agenda for the assembly.",Reuters,"May 20, 2022 3:23 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/united-states-cdc-backs-covid-19-boosters-for-children-5-to-11/,US CDC backs COVID-19 boosters for children 5 to 11,"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday, May 20, recommended the COVID-19 vaccine booster for children ages 5 to 11 after an advisory panel voted to back them, at least five months after completing their primary vaccination course.
CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement that she “endorsed” the vote by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices “to expand eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine booster doses. Children 5 through 11 should receive a booster dose at least 5 months after their primary series.”
“With over 18 million doses administered in this age group, we know that these vaccines are safe, and we must continue to increase the number of children who are protected,” Walensky added.
The advisers considered data from the CDC that showed protection from the initial two shots starts to wane over time, and that boosters in older age groups improved efficacy against severe COVID and hospitalizations.
The Food and Drug Administration authorized booster doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for the age group on Tuesday as COVID cases are on the rise again in the United States.
The US government has been pushing for eligible Americans to get boosted, but fewer than half of those who are fully vaccinated have rolled up their sleeves for an additional shot.
With over 18 million doses administered in this age group, we know that these vaccines are safe, and we must continue to increase the number of children who are protected.
Pfizer said at the meeting that data showed a third dose of its vaccine generated a strong immune response against the Omicron variant in healthy children ages 5-11 years.
The CDC also presented safety data showing that the incidence of heart inflammation after vaccination in the age group was significantly lower than in adolescents and young adults.
Just over 29% of US children ages 5-11 are considered fully vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot. The vaccine is not yet authorized for children younger than 5.
The vaccine committee voted 11 to 1 to recommend the additional shots, with one doctor abstaining.
Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot, a professor at Vanderbilt University, was the lone committee member to vote against recommending the boosters, arguing that the focus should be on increasing the vaccination rate in the age group.
“Boosters are great once we’ve gotten everyone their first round,” she said.
Companies are already looking into the possible need for redesigned COVID-19 vaccines for the fall to target new variants of concern.
CDC scientist Dr. Amanda Cohn said redesigned vaccines may not be available for children right away because the pediatric shots are a different formulation than what would be given to adults.",Reuters,"May 20, 2022 12:48 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/explainer-why-monkeypox-cases-are-spreading-in-europe-united-states/,"EXPLAINER: Why monkeypox cases are spreading in Europe, US","LONDON, UK – A handful of cases of monkeypox have now been reported or are suspected in Britain, Portugal, Spain and the United States.
The outbreaks are raising alarm because the viral disease, which spreads through close contact and was first found in monkeys, mostly occurs in west and central Africa, and only very occasionally spreads elsewhere.
Here is what scientists know so far.
Monkeypox is a virus that causes fever symptoms as well as a distinctive bumpy rash. It is usually mild, although there are two main strains: the Congo strain, which is more severe – with up to 10% mortality – and the West African strain, which has a fatality rate in about 1% of cases. The UK cases have been reported as the West African strain.
“Historically, there have been very few cases exported. It has only happened eight times in the past before this year,” said Jimmy Whitworth, a professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who said it was “highly unusual”.
Portugal has logged five confirmed cases, and Spain is testing 23 potential cases. Neither country has reported cases before.
The United States has also reported one case.
The virus spreads through close contact, both in spillovers from animals and, less commonly, between humans. It was first found in monkeys in 1958, hence the name, although rodents are now seen as the probable main animal host.
Transmission this time is puzzling experts, because a number of the cases in the United Kingdom – nine as of May 18 – have no known connection with each other. Only the first case reported on May 6 had recently traveled to Nigeria.
As such, experts have warned of wider transmission if cases have gone unreported.
The UK Health Security Agency’s alert also highlighted that the recent cases were predominantly among men who self-identified as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men, and advised those groups to be aware.
Scientists are now carrying out genomic sequencing to see if the viruses are linked, the World Health Organization (WHO) said this week.
One possible scenario behind the rise in cases is increased travel as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted.
“My working theory would be that there’s a lot of it about in west and central Africa, travel has resumed, and that’s why we are seeing more cases,” said Whitworth.
Monkeypox puts virologists on the alert because it is in the smallpox family, although it causes less serious illness.
Smallpox was eradicated by vaccination in 1980, and the shot has since been phased out. But it also protects against monkeypox, and so the winding down of vaccination campaigns has led to a jump in monkeypox cases in areas where the disease is endemic, according to Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA in California.
She said urgent investigation of the new cases was important as “they could suggest a novel means of spread or a change in the virus, but this is all to be determined”.
Experts urged people not to panic.
“This isn’t going to cause a nationwide epidemic like COVID did, but it’s a serious outbreak of a serious disease – and we should take it seriously,” said Whitworth.",Reuters,"May 19, 2022 8:46 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/lacking-vaccines-north-korea-battles-covid-19-with-antibiotics-home-remedies/,"Lacking vaccines, North Korea battles COVID-19 with antibiotics, home remedies","SEOUL, South Korea –  Standing tall in bright red hazmat suits, five North Korean health workers stride towards an ambulance to do battle with a COVID-19 outbreak that – in the presumed absence of vaccines – the country is using antibiotics and home remedies to treat.
The isolated state is one of only two countries yet to begin a vaccination campaign and, until last week, had insisted it was COVID-free.
Now it is mobilizing forces including the army and a public information campaign to combat what authorities have acknowledged is an “explosive” outbreak.
In an interview on state television on Monday, May 16, Vice Minister of Public Health Kim Hyong-hun said the country had switched from a quarantine to a treatment system to handle the hundreds of thousands of suspected “fever” cases reported each day.
The broadcaster showed footage of the hazmat team, and masked workers opening windows, cleaning desks and machines and spraying disinfectant.
To treat COVID-19 and its symptoms, state media have encouraged patients to use painkillers and fever reducers such as ibuprofen, and amoxicillin and other antibiotics – which do not fight viruses but are sometimes prescribed for secondary bacterial infections.
While previously playing down vaccines as “no panacea,” media have also recommended gargling salt water, or drinking lonicera japonica tea or willow leaf tea three times a day.
“Traditional treatments are the best!” one woman told state broadcasters as her husband described having their children gargle with salted water every morning and night.
An elderly Pyongyang resident said she had been helped by ginger tea and ventilating her room.
“I was first scared by COVID, but after following the doctors’ advice and getting the proper treatments, it turned out not a big deal,” she said in a televised interview.
The country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, said on Sunday – when state news agency KCNA reported 392,920 more cases of fever and eight more deaths – that drugs reserves were not reaching people, and ordered the army medical corps to help stabilize supplies in Pyongyang, where the outbreak appears to be centered.
KCNA said the cumulative tally of the fever-stricken stood at 1,213,550, with 50 deaths. It did not say how many suspected infections had tested positive for COVID.
Authorities say a large proportion of the deaths have been due to people “careless in taking drugs due to the lack of knowledge and understanding” of the Omicron variant and the correct method for treating it.
The World Health Organization has shipped some health kits and other supplies to North Korea, but has not said what drugs they contain. Neighbors China and South Korea have offered to send aid if Pyongyang requests it.
While not claiming that antibiotics and home remedies will eliminate COVID-19, North Korea has a long history of developing scientifically unproven treatments, including an injection made from ginseng grown in rare earth elements it claimed could cure everything from AIDS to impotence.
Some have roots in traditional medicines, while others have been developed to offset a lack of modern drugs or as “made in North Korea” exports.
Despite a high number of trained doctors and experience mobilizing for health emergencies, North Korea’s medical system is woefully under-resourced, experts say.
In a March report, an independent UN human rights investigator said it was plagued by “under-investment in infrastructure, medical personnel, equipment and medicine, irregular power supplies and inadequate water and sanitation facilities”.
Kim Myeong-hee, 40, who left the North for South Korea in 2003, said such shortcomings led many North Koreans to rely on home remedies.
“Even if we go to the hospital, there are actually no medicines. There was also no electricity so medical equipment could not be used,” she said.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/explainer-how-north-koreas-covid-19-outbreak-could-ignite-a-major-health-crisis/,EXPLAINER: How North Korea’s COVID-19 outbreak could ignite a major health crisis,"SEOUL, South Korea – North Korea’s admission that it is battling an “explosive” COVID-19 outbreak has raised concerns that the virus could devastate a country with an under-resourced health system, limited testing capabilities, and no vaccine program.
The isolated North confirmed on Thursday,  May 12, its first COVID-19 infections since the pandemic emerged more than two years ago, shifting to the “maximum emergency epidemic prevention system” and imposing a national lockdown. On Friday it reported its first COVID-related death.
State media have not confirmed the total number of COVID-19 cases so far, but said that more than 350,000 people have shown fever symptoms since late April.
Along with Eritrea, North Korea is one of only two countries that have not started a vaccination campaign against COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
The COVAX global COVID-19 vaccine-sharing program cut the number of doses allocated for North Korea as the country has so far failed to arrange for any shipments, reportedly over international monitoring requirements.
Pyongyang also declined offers of vaccines from China.
The latest reported assessment of whether leader Kim Jong-Un  was vaccinated was from July 2021, when South Korea’s spy agency said there were no signs he had received a shot.
North Korea said last year it had developed its own polymerase chain reaction (PCR) equipment to conduct coronavirus tests, and Russia has said it had delivered small numbers of test kits.
But North Korea is heavily sanctioned over its nuclear weapons program, and since 2020 has maintained strict border lockdowns that have blocked many supplies.
Experts said that so far the pace of testing suggests North Korea cannot handle the number of symptomatic cases it has reported.
As of the end of March, only 64,207 of North Korea’s 25 million people had been tested for COVID, and all the results were negative, the latest WHO data shows.
“North Korea has been testing around 1,400 people each week. Assuming they were at their peak capacity, then they can perform 400 tests per day max – not nearly enough to test 350,000 people with symptoms,” said Harvard Medical School’s Kee Park, who has worked on health care projects in North Korea.
It’s unclear whether North Korea has imposed any mask mandates since the pandemic began. Citizens were at times seen wearing masks, but also going mask-free at some major political events that mobilized tens of thousands of people.
Kim was shown for the first time wearing a mask at the COVID response meeting on Thursday.
North Korea ranks last in the world for its ability to rapidly respond to and mitigate the spread of an epidemic, according to the latest Global Health Security Index in December.
Although it has a high number of trained doctors and the ability to rapidly deploy and organize staff in the face of emergencies, North Korea’s health care system is chronically under-resourced.
Every North Korean village has one or two clinics or hospitals, and most county hospitals are equipped with x-ray facilities, “though not necessarily functional ones,” the WHO said in its 2014-2019 Country Cooperation Strategy report.
Kwon Young-se, South Korea’s new nominee to be the unification minister, responsible for inter-Korean ties, said at his confirmation hearing on Thursday the North is believed to lack even the most basic medical supplies such as painkillers and disinfectants.
An independent UN human rights investigator reported in March that the North’s COVID-19 restrictions, including the border closings, could have prevented massive outbreaks “though likely at considerable cost to the wider health situation.”
“Chronic issues plague the country’s healthcare system, including under-investment in infrastructure, medical personnel, equipment and medicine, irregular power supplies and inadequate water and sanitation facilities,” the report said.
The outbreak could pose a political challenge for the North’s authoritarian leader, North Koreans who had defected to the South said.
“Kim ordered the mobilization of reserve medical supplies, which means in North Korea they will now use war reserves and that general hospitals have ran out of medicines,” said Thae Young-ho, a former North Korean diplomat who defected to the South in 2016 and is now a lawmaker.
Ji Seong-ho, another South Korean lawmaker who left the North in 2006, said the virus could spread rapidly, due partly to the lack of a working medical system.
“An enormous number of people died during the (1990s) famine after typhoid broke out. It was a nightmare for the North Korean regime, and for the North Korean people,” Ji told a parliamentary session.",Reuters,"May 13, 2022 10:13 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/roche-cancer-immunotherapy-second-trial-fails/,Blow to Roche’s cancer immunotherapy prospects as second trial fails,"Development of a new cancer immunotherapy pioneered by Roche was thrown in doubt on Wednesday, May 11, when the drug, tiragolumab, failed to slow progression of lung cancer in a second trial.
In a study, a combination of tiragolumab and Roche’s established Tecentriq drug did not slow disease progression in newly diagnosed cases of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer when compared with patients on Tecentriq only, the company said.
That was after tiragolumab in March failed to slow progression of a different, more aggressive form of lung cancer.
Roche shares were seen 2.2% lower in bank Julius Baer’s pre-market trading.
The setback will likely give pause to more than half a dozen companies working on similar compounds in a class of drugs called anti-TIGIT. Merck & Co has been seen as closest behind Roche in that race.
Roche added that the trial would continue after the disappointing interim readout to gather more data on tiragolumab’s ability to prolong the lives of trial participants.
“While these results are not what we hoped for in our first analysis, we look forward to seeing mature overall survival for this study to determine next steps,” said Roche Chief Medical Officer Levi Garraway.
TIGIT is a receptor found on immune system cells as a backstop to prevent misguided immune attacks against normal body tissue. Some cancer types, however, exploit TIGIT to grow unnoticed by cell-killing immune cells.
A similar mode of action is behind a blockbuster class of immune drugs known as PD-1 and PD-L1, such as Merck & Co’s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo.
That multi-billion-dollar success has pushed the industry to explore similar anti-cancer concepts, such as anti-TIGIT, typically tested in a drug cocktail with established PD-1 or PD-L1 drugs.
Gilead Sciences last November exercised an option to collaborate with Arcus Biosciences RCUS.N on the anti-TIGIT drug domvanalimab.
GlaxoSmithKline in June 2021 struck a licensing deal worth up to $2 billion with iTeos Therapeutics Inc for an anti-TIGIT candidate.
Bristol-Myers Squibb and Agenus Inc are collaborating on a drug under a May 2021 partnership.
Coherus BioSciences in January exercised an option to license a drug candidate by Shanghai Junshi Biosciences for the US and Canadian markets.
For Roche, which is seeking to offset a decline in sales due to competition from cheaper copies of a trio of established cancer drugs, more hope rests now on an experimental Alzheimer’s drug for which trial results are expected later this year.",Reuters,"May 11, 2022 3:47 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/more-died-covid-19-than-officially-reported-world-health-organization/,Almost 3 times as many died as a result of COVID-19 than officially reported – WHO,"Almost three times as many people have died as a result of COVID-19 as the official data show, according to a new World Health Organization (WHO) report, the most comprehensive look at the true global toll of the pandemicso far.
There were 14.9 million excess deaths associated with COVID-19 by the end of 2021, the UN body said on Thursday. The official count of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 and reported to WHO in that period, from January 2020 to the end of December 2021, is slightly more than 5.4 million.
The WHO’s excess mortality figures reflect people who died of COVID-19 as well as those who died as an indirect result of the outbreak, including people who could not access healthcare for other conditions when systems were overwhelmed during huge waves of infection. It also accounts for deaths averted during the pandemic, for example because of the lower risk of traffic accidents during lockdowns.
But the numbers are also far higher than the official tally because of deaths that were missed in countries without adequate reporting. Even pre-pandemic, around 6 in 10 deaths around the world were not registered, WHO said.
The WHO report said that almost half of the deaths that until now had not been counted were in India. The report suggests that 4.7 million people died there as a result of the pandemic, mainly during a huge surge in May and June 2021.
The Indian government, however, puts its death toll for the January 2020-December 2021 period far lower: about 480,000. WHO said it had not yet fully examined new data provided this week by India, which has pushed back against the WHO estimates and issued its own mortality figures for all causes of death in 2020 on Tuesday. WHO said it may add a disclaimer to the report highlighting the ongoing conversation with India.
The WHO panel, made up of international experts who have been working on the data for months, used a combination of national and local information, as well as statistical models, to estimate totals where the data is  incomplete – a methodology that India has criticized.
However, other independent assessments have also put the death toll in India far higher than the official government tally, including a report published in Science which suggested three million people may have died of COVID in the country.
Other models have also reached similar conclusions about the global death toll being far higher than the recorded statistics. For comparison, around 50 million people are thought to have died in the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, and 36 million have died of HIV since the epidemic began in the 1980s.
Samira Asma, WHO assistant director general for data, analytics and delivery for impact, who co-led the calculation process, said data was the “lifeblood of public health” needed to assess and learn from what happened during the pandemic, and called for more support for countries to improve reporting.

They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Asthma in children may worsen after an infection with the coronavirus, doctors warn.
They studied nearly 62,000 US children with asthma who had PCR tests for the virus in the first year of the pandemic, including more than 7,700 who tested positive. Infected children had significantly more asthma visits, hospitalizations, emergency inhaler use, and steroid treatments during the six months after their illness compared to children who tested negative and to their own prior history, researchers reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice. Children who tested negative for the virus “had improved asthma control for the next six months, meaning fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations for asthma, and less asthma treatment,” said Dr. Christine Chou of Children’s Health of Orange County, in California.
Results of earlier studies showing improvement in asthma control in the early part of the pandemic were likely due to public health measures like staying home and masking, which curbed exposure to asthma triggers, she said. Despite the overall impression that children with asthma did well during the first year of the pandemic, Chou added, the new study shows “longer lasting harm of COVID on children’s asthma control.”
Among people who were previously infected with the coronavirus, a third dose of an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna may not boost their protection against the Omicron variant of the virus, according to new data.
Researchers studied nearly 130,000 people tested for COVID in Connecticut from November 2021 through January 2022, including 10,676 with Omicron infections. Roughly 6% to 8% had been infected with previous versions of the coronavirus, according to a report posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Two doses of an mRNA vaccine did help protect against Omicron among people with prior infections, but “we did not detect an additional benefit of receiving a third booster dose among this population,” said Margaret Lind of Yale University.
A separate study from Canada, also posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review, similarly found that more than two vaccine doses “may be of marginal incremental value” for protecting previously-infected individuals against Omicron. The message, Lind said, “should be that (1) people should get two doses of mRNA vaccine regardless of if they have had a prior infection or not, that (2) people without prior infections should get a booster dose and that (3) people with prior infections should consider a booster dose, especially if they are in a high risk group for life threatening complications, but recognize that it may not provide significant additional protection against infection above two doses.”",Reuters,"May 3, 2022 7:17 AM PHT"

The scientists from multiple institutions were examining Omicron’s BA.4 and BA.5 sublineages – which the World Health Organization last month added to its monitoring list. They took blood samples from 39 participants previously infected by Omicron when it first showed up at the end of last year.
Fifteen were vaccinated – eight with Pfizer’s shot; seven with J&J’s – while the other 24 were not.
“The vaccinated group showed about a 5-fold higher neutralization capacity…and should be better protected,” said the study, a pre-print of which was released over the weekend.
In the unvaccinated samples, there was an almost eightfold decrease in antibody production when exposed to BA.4 and BA.5, compared with the original BA.1 Omicron lineage. Blood from the vaccinated people showed a threefold decrease.
South Africa may be entering a fifth COVID wave earlier than expected, officials and scientists said on Friday, blaming a sustained rise in infections that seems to be driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-variants.
Only about 30% of South Africa’s population of 60 million is fully vaccinated.

The FDA did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.
The agency could publish final rules as early as 2023 and the ban could be set to take effect in 2024, the newspaper report said.
For decades, menthol cigarettes have been in the crosshairs of anti-smoking groups who have argued that they contribute to disproportionate health burdens on Black communities and play a role in luring young people into smoking.
The proposal, which comes a year after the agency announced the plan, is likely to face stiff opposition from the tobacco industry.
The WSJ report said at least one tobacco company has indicated that it might sue, which could further delay the ban.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/bionic-limbs-lift-gaza-amputees-self-esteem/,Bionic limbs lift Gaza amputees’ self-esteem,"GAZA, Palestinian Authority – A “smart” prosthetic hand that mimics human anatomy and motion has allowed Ahmed Abu Hamda to play with his children and regain self esteem, part of a new project in Gaza Strip, where conflict with Israel has left hundreds of Palestinians without limbs.
Since March, a Qatari-funded hospital in Gaza has been providing myoelectric prostheses, motorized devices powered by batteries and controlled by electrical signals generated by muscles.
Hamda, 36, lost his right hand in 2007 when unexploded ordnance detonated. He is now able to play with his two children, eat, drink and do home repairs with his newly-installed myoelectric limb, he said.
“Since I got the limb my outer appearance improved, people don’t recognize I have an amputated hand,” he told Reuters at Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani Hospital for Rehabilitation and Prosthetics.
“At home, I can drink water, and if I go to the market I can hold sacks and the mobile phone,” the satellite dish installer said.
The project is the first of its kind in the Palestinian territories. So far, 21 amputees in Gaza have received “smart” limbs, with another 40 on the waiting list, hospital officials said.
The International Committee of the Red Cross lists at least 1,600 amputees among Gaza’s population of two million people. Assalama Charitable Society, which cares for wounded and disabled people, said 532 Gazans had lost limbs in the conflict with Israel.
Inaugurated in 2019, the Hamad hospital has treated hundreds of amputees. Since 2014, Qatar has spent more than $1 billion in construction and relief projects in Gaza, which is run by the Islamist Hamas group.
Patients are not charged for an artificial limb, said Noureldeen Salah, general director of Hamad hospital, putting the cost of a “smart” prosthesis at around $20,000.
Now that he has his new artificial hand, Abu Hamda said, he can embrace life with his four-year-old daughter and 18-month-old son more fully.

It has added BA.4 and BA.5, sister variants of the original BA.1 Omicron variant, to its list for monitoring. It is already tracking BA.1 and BA.2 – now globally dominant – as well as BA.1.1 and BA.3.
The WHO said it had begun tracking them because of their “additional mutations that need to be further studied to understand their impact on immune escape potential”.
Viruses mutate all the time but only some mutations affect their ability to spread or evade prior immunity from vaccination or infection, or the severity of disease they cause.
For instance, BA.2 now represents nearly 94% of all sequenced cases and is more transmissible than its siblings, but the evidence so far suggests it is no more likely to cause severe disease.
Only a few dozen cases of BA.4 and BA.5 have been reported to the global GISAID database, according to WHO.
The UK’s Health Security Agency said last week BA.4 had been found in South Africa, Denmark, Botswana, Scotland and England from January 10 to March 30.

There is no clear evidence in the European Union that vaccine protection against severe disease is waning substantially in adults with normal immune systems aged 60-79, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said in a joint statement.
They cautioned, however, that it may become necessary to consider a fourth dose in this age group if the epidemiological situation changes.
Both agencies agreed a fourth dose can be given to adults 80 years of age and above.
That recommendation came a week after European health ministers urged the bloc’s executive to back a fourth COVID-19 shot for people over 60 to boost immunity in the absence of vaccines that specifically protect against the Omicron variant.

They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
New research may help shed light on a rare but serious blood-clotting problem associated with the COVID-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson.
Five unrelated people with this clotting complication, known as vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, all had unusually-structured antibodies against a protein called PF4 that is involved in blood clotting, the researchers found. Furthermore, all five had a specific version of a gene responsible for producing these antibodies, they reported on Monday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
“The combination of a variant in a gene and the evolution of this antibody towards targeting in a highly deleterious manner the PF4 protein… leads to this disastrous complication,” the researchers said. The prevalence of this gene varies and is highest in people of European descent, according to the report.
The finding “paves the way for a potential genetic screening tool to identify patients carrying this gene variant who are at risk of this severe complication” after receipt of these vaccines, said Tom Gordon and Jing Jing Wang of Flinders University of South Australia, two of the study’s authors. “Additionally, this provides a unique opportunity for targeted, specific therapy development aimed at neutralizing this highly damaging but very specific antibody.”
Hospitalized COVID-19 patients who are severely immunocompromised may benefit from treatment with a purified, highly-concentrated form of antibody-rich blood plasma from previously infected people known as hyperimmune globulin, according to a small trial.
Netherlands-based researchers measured the need for mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen, readmission for COVID-19 after hospital discharge or lack of clinical improvement among 18 subjects four weeks after administration of either SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin or immune globulin that did not contain antibodies to the coronavirus. These adverse outcomes occurred in 20% of patients who received the hyperimmune globulin with COVID-19 antibodies, compared to 88% of those who did not, according to a report posted on Tuesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. The trial participants were organ transplant patients taking strong immunosuppressive drugs and others with diseases or medication regimens that impaired the function of immune cells called B cells.
In severely immunocompromised patients, SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin “may reduce the risk for severe COVID-19 and can be used when no monoclonal antibody therapies are available,” the researchers concluded.
People who regularly wear glasses have a moderately lower risk of contracting COVID-19 while contact lenses offered no added protection, according to a large study that highlights the importance of the eye as a route of coronavirus infection.
More than 19,000 participants in the Virus Watch study in England and Wales responded to a questionnaire on the use of glasses and contact lenses. Starting as early as June 2020, participants had been reporting weekly on their COVID-19 status, and more than 11,000 provided monthly blood samples to show whether or not they had been infected with the coronavirus. After taking other risk factors into account, the researchers found a 15% lower risk of infection for those who reported wearing glasses always for general use compared to those who never wore glasses. The protective effect was reduced in those who said their glasses interfered with mask wearing, and there was no protective effect seen for contact lens wearers, according to a report posted on Monday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
“Protective eye wear should be considered as part of broader strategies to prevent community transmission of infection and may be valuable to consider in the event of future pandemics and in high exposure occupations including healthcare,” the researchers said.",Reuters,"Apr 7, 2022 8:08 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/middle-east/israel-polio-vaccine-drive-first-case-since-1988/,Israel in polio vaccine drive after logging first case since 1988,"JERUSALEM – Israel has launched a polio vaccination drive after its first case of the disease in more than three decades, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday, April 5, voicing concern turnout may be depressed by public fatigue over the COVID-19 pandemic.
Poliomyelitis, or polio, is a viral disease of the brain and spinal cord that can cause irreversible paralysis. It affects mainly children under the age of five. Israel began vaccinating against it in 1957 and previously logged its last case in 1988.
But since March a girl has been diagnosed with the disease and at least six non-symptomatic cases have been detected in the Jerusalem area, the Health Ministry said. All were unvaccinated. The virus was found in sewage from three other cities, it added.
“I view this as very acute. It may be a small case-load right now, but that’s the tip of the iceberg,” Nachman Ash, the ministry’s director-general, told Tel Aviv radio station 103 FM.
Polio vaccinations are routinely offered to Israeli children. Due to a policy change between 2005 and 2014, some received one oral dose rather than a two-dose regimen.
The ministry’s focus now is on children who skipped the vaccination entirely, or those who got only one oral dose.
Unlike previous polio vaccination drives, “this time it’s far more difficult. People are fatigued from the coronavirus, fatigued from the (COVID-19) vaccines,” Ash said.
East Jerusalem is home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians tended to by Israel’s healthcare system. Many have kin in the occupied West Bank, where the Palestinians exercise limited self-rule – but have reported no new polio cases.",Reuters,"Apr 5, 2022 8:01 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/scientists-publish-first-complete-human-genome/,Scientists publish the first complete human genome,"WASHINGTON DC, USA – Scientists on Thursday, March 31, published the first complete human genome, filling in gaps remaining after previous efforts while offering new promise in the search for clues regarding disease-causing mutations and genetic variation among the world’s 7.9 billion people.
Researchers in 2003 unveiled what was then billed as the complete sequence of the human genome. But about 8% of it had not been fully deciphered, mainly because it consisted of highly repetitive chunks of DNA that were difficult to mesh with the rest.
A consortium of scientists resolved that in research published in the journal Science. The work was initially made public in 2020 before its formal peer review process.
“Generating a truly complete human genome sequence represents an incredible scientific achievement, providing the first comprehensive view of our DNA blueprint,” Eric Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), part of the US National Institutes of Health, said in a statement.
“This foundational information will strengthen the many ongoing efforts to understand all the functional nuances of the human genome, which in turn will empower genetic studies of human disease,” Green added.
The consortium’s full version is composed of 3.055 billion base pairs, the units from which chromosomes and our genes are built, and 19,969 genes that encode proteins. Of these genes, the researchers identified about 2,000 new ones. Most of those are disabled, but 115 may still be active. The scientists also spotted about 2 million additional genetic variants, 622 of which were present in medically relevant genes.
The consortium was dubbed Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T), named after the structures found at the ends of all chromosomes, the threadlike structure in the nucleus of most living cells that carries genetic information in the form of genes.
“In the future, when someone has their genome sequenced, we will be able to identify all of the variants in their DNA and use that information to better guide their healthcare,” Adam Phillippy, one of the leaders of T2T and a senior investigator at NHGRI, said in a statement.
“Truly finishing the human genome sequence was like putting on a new pair of glasses. Now that we can clearly see everything, we are one step closer to understanding what it all means,” Phillippy added.
Among other things, the new DNA sequences provided fresh detail about the region around what is called the centromere, where chromosomes are grabbed and pulled apart when cells divide to ensure that each “daughter” cell inherits the proper number of chromosomes.
“Uncovering the complete sequence of these formerly missing regions of the genome told us so much about how they’re organized, which was totally unknown for many chromosomes,” Nicolas Altemose, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a statement.",Reuters,"Apr 1, 2022 7:18 AM PHT"

The US Food and Drug Administration said the new boosters – a fourth round of shots for most vaccine recipients – of the Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc vaccines are to be administered at least four months after the previous dose. They are intended to offer more protection against severe disease and hospitalization.
The FDA also authorized the second booster dose of the vaccines for younger people with compromised immune systems – those aged 12 and older for the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and 18 and older for Moderna’s.
The authorization comes as some scientists have raised concerns about the highly contagious BA.2 Omicron subvariant, which has driven new spikes in COVID-19 cases in other countries.
COVID-19 cases in the United States have dropped sharply since a record surge in January, but have seen a small uptick over the past week, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“While this EUA (emergency use authorization) will help address a current need for some, we’re working diligently to develop an updated vaccine that not only protects against current COVID-19 strains, but also provides more durable responses,” Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in a statement.
Pfizer and BioNTech originally asked for the next booster doses to be authorized for people 65 and older in a submission citing data collected in Israel, where a second booster is already authorized for many people over age 18. The companies did not explain why the age range had been expanded.
Scientists and officials have debated whether young, healthy people will need a fourth shot. A study of Israeli healthcare workers suggested that the fourth dose added little additional protection in the age group.

The country’s largest healthcare provider, Clalit Health Services, said the 40-day study included more than half a million people aged 60 to 100.
Some 58% of participants had received a second booster – or two shots in addition to the basic two-shot regimen. The remainder had received only one booster. Researchers recorded 92 deaths among the first group and 232 deaths among the second, smaller group.
“The main conclusion is that the second booster is lifesaving,” said Ronen Arbel, Health Outcomes Researcher at Clalit and Sapir College.
The report was issued as a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed. The research excluded people who received rival Moderna’s vaccine and those who had taken oral anti-COVID therapy.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/generic-drugmakers-make-cheap-version-pfizer-covid-pill-paxlovid/,Generic drugmakers sign on to make cheap version of Pfizer COVID pill,"Thirty five generic drugmakers around the world will make cheap versions of Pfizer Incorporated’s PFE.N highly effective COVID-19 oral antiviral Paxlovid to supply the treatment in 95 poorer countries, the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) said on Thursday, March 18.
Pfizer struck a deal in 2021 with the group to allow generic drugmakers to make the pills for 95 low- and middle-income countries. They have been working since then to select the drugmakers they will license.
Paxlovid is expected to be an important tool in the fight against COVID-19 after it reduced hospitalizations in high-risk patients by around 90% in a clinical trial. The results were significantly better than those for Merck & Co’s MRK.N rival antiviral pill molnupiravir in its clinical trial.
Pfizer and Merck both struck deals with MPP to allow generic versions of their new drugs in some parts of the world, a rarity for pharmaceutical companies that usually fiercely protect their treatments over the life of their patents.
Merck, on its own and through the MPP license, has deals with dozens of drugmakers to make its pill and generic versions are already available in some countries.
But Pfizer and MPP do not expect any of generic drugmakers to be able to manufacture significant supplies of Paxlovid before the end of the year.
The 35 companies that will produce versions of Paxlovid or its active ingredient are based in 12 countries, the MPP said. They include some of the world’s largest generic manufacturers like Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries TEVA.TA, India-based Sun Pharmaceutical Industries SUN.NS, and US-based Viatris Inc VTRS.O.
Six of the companies will make the main ingredient for the drug, nine plan to turn that into a finished product, and the remaining companies will do both.
Paxlovid is a two-drug treatment that pairs a new compound, nirmatrelvir, with the older antiviral ritonavir, which is already available as a generic.
Pfizer will not receive royalties from the sale of the generic versions of its drug while COVID-19 remains classified as a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” by the World Health Organization.
Following the pandemic period, sales to low-income countries will remain royalty free, lower-middle-income countries and upper-middle-income countries will be subject to a 5% royalty for sales to the public sector and a 10% royalty for sales to the private sector, MPP said.
Pfizer has said it plans to produce at least 120 million treatment courses of the treatment this year, well short of its estimate of the 2022 market for antiviral pills of 250 million people globally.
The company is also expected to provide around 10 million courses Paxlovid it produces to low- and middle-income countries this year, according to an official with the Global Fund, a healthcare NGO working to buy the pills from the drugmaker.",Reuters,"Mar 18, 2022 7:59 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/world-health-organization-global-rise-covid-19-cases-tip-iceberg/,WHO says global rise in COVID-19 cases is ‘tip of the iceberg’,"Figures showing a global rise in COVID-19 cases could herald a much bigger problem as some countries also report a drop in testing rates, the WHO said on Tuesday, March 15, warning nations to remain vigilant against the virus.
After more than a month of decline, COVID-19 cases started to increase around the world last week, the WHO said, with lockdowns in Asia and China’s Jilin province battling to contain an outbreak.
A combination of factors was causing the increases, including the highly transmissible Omicron variant and its cousin the BA.2 sub-variant, and the lifting of public health and social measures, the WHO said.
“These increases are occurring despite reductions in testing in some countries, which means the cases we’re seeing are just the tip of the iceberg,” WHO’s head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.
Low vaccination rates in some countries, driven partly by a “huge amount of misinformation” also explained the rise, WHO officials said.
New infections jumped by 8% globally compared to the previous week, with 11 million new cases and just over 43,000 new deaths reported from March 7-13. It is the first rise since the end of January.
The biggest jump was in the WHO’s Western Pacific region, which includes South Korea and China, where cases rose by 25% and deaths by 27%.
Africa also saw a 12% rise in new cases and 14% rise in deaths, and Europe a 2% rise in cases but no jump in deaths. Other regions reported declining cases, including the eastern Mediterranean region, although this area saw a 38% rise in deaths linked to a previous spike in infections.
A number of experts have raised concerns that Europe faces another coronavirus wave, with case rising since the beginning of March in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.
The WHO’s Maria Van Kerkhove said at the briefing that BA.2 appears to be the most transmissible variant so far.
However, there are no signs that it causes more severe disease, and no evidence that any other new variants are driving the rise in cases.
The picture in Europe is also not universal. Denmark, for example, saw a brief peak in cases in the first half of February, driven by BA.2, which quickly subsided.
But experts have begun to warn that the United States could soon see a similar wave to that seen in Europe, potentially driven by BA.2, the lifting of restrictions and potential waning immunity from vaccines given several months ago.
“I agree with the easing of restrictions, because you can’t think of it as an emergency after two years,” said Antonella Viola, professor of immunology at Italy’s University of Padua.
“We just have to avoid thinking that COVID is no longer there. And therefore maintain the strictly necessary measures, which are essentially the continuous monitoring and tracking of cases, and the maintenance of the obligation to wear a mask in closed or very crowded places.”",Reuters,"Mar 17, 2022 8:42 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-variant-combines-delta-omicron-identified-dog-sniffs-out-virus-high-accuracy/,COVID-19 studies: Variant that combines Delta and Omicron identified; dogs sniff out virus with high accuracy,"The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Hybrid versions of the coronavirus that combine genes from the Delta and Omicron variants – dubbed “Deltacron” – have been identified in at least 17 patients in the United States and Europe, researchers said.
Because there have been so few confirmed cases, it is too soon to know whether Deltacron infections will be very transmissible or cause severe disease, said Philippe Colson of IHU Mediterranee Infection in Marseille, France, lead author of a report posted on Tuesday, March 8, on medRxiv ahead of peer review. His team described three patients in France infected with a version of SARS-CoV-2 that combines the spike protein from an Omicron variant with the “body” of a Delta variant. Another two unrelated Deltacron infections have been identified in the United States, according to an unpublished report by genetics research company Helix that has been submitted to medRxiv and seen by Reuters. On virus research bulletin boards, other teams have reported an additional 12 Deltacron infections in Europe since January – all with an Omicron spike and a Delta body.
Genetic recombinations of human coronaviruses have been known to happen when two variants infect the same host cell. “During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, two or more variants have co-circulated during same periods of time and in same geographical areas…. This created opportunities for recombination between these two variants,” said Colson, adding that his team has designed a PCR test that “can quickly test positive samples for the presence of this…virus.”
New research adds to evidence that trained dogs could help screen crowds to identify people infected with the coronavirus.
At two community screening centers in Paris, 335 volunteers getting traditional PCR tests also provided sweat samples. Overall, 78 people with symptoms and 31 people without symptoms tested positive by PCR. Given the sweat samples to smell, the dogs were 97% accurate at detecting the infected patients, and 100% accurate at detecting infection in the asymptomatic patients, according to a report posted on Tuesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. They also were 91% accurate at identifying volunteers who were not infected, and 94% accurate at ruling out the infection in people without symptoms.
“Canine testing is non-invasive and provides immediate and reliable results,” the authors said. “Further studies will be focused on direct sniffing by dogs to evaluate sniffer dogs for mass pre-test in airports, harbors, railways stations, cultural activities or sporting events.”
The many coronavirus particles inside an infected person likely include some mutated ones that may turn out to be early examples of important variants, new findings suggest.
Closely analyzing virus particles obtained from 10 people with infections attributed to the Alpha variant in Spain in April 2021, researchers identified some mutated particles resembling the Omicron variant, which was not formally identified until seven months later. They also found mutations characteristic of a form of Delta and Iota, according to a report published on Tuesday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. While identifying an individual patient’s dominant variant may be sufficient for diagnostic purposes, the “ultra deep” genetic sequencing used in this study could help scientists track mutations in SARS-CoV-2 particles that might evolve into variants of concern, the researchers said.
“The virus that replicates in each infected patient is in reality a mixture of slightly different SARS-CoV-2 viruses,” and these different viruses account for varying proportions of the full “ensemble,” said coauthor Celia Perales of Universidad Autonoma de Madrid. Minority variants in one infected individual can become dominant in someone else, either by chance, or due to a selective advantage related to the presence or absence of drugs, vaccines, or other factors, she said.",Reuters,"Mar 11, 2022 12:24 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/united-states-man-transplanted-genetically-modified-pig-heart-dies/,"US man with transplanted genetically modified pig heart dies, hospital says","A 57-year-old man with terminal heart disease who made history as the first person to receive a genetically modified pig’s heart died on Tuesday afternoon, March 8, at the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC), the hospital said.
David Bennett received the transplant on January 7.
His condition began deteriorating several days ago, the hospital said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that Bennett was given “compassionate palliative care” after it became clear that he would not recover.
Bennett was able to communicate with his family during his final hours, the hospital said.
Bennett first came to UMMC as a patient in October and was placed on a heart-lung bypass machine to keep him alive, but he was deemed ineligible for a conventional heart transplant.
After Bennett was implanted with a pig heart that had been genetically modified to prevent rejection in a first-of-its-kind surgery, his son called the procedure “a miracle.”
The surgery, performed by a team at the hospital, was among the first to demonstrate the feasibility of a pig-to-human heart transplant, a field made possible by new gene editing tools.
For Bennett, the procedure was his last option.
“Before consenting to receive the transplant, Mr. Bennett was fully informed of the procedure’s risks, and that the procedure was experimental with unknown risks and benefits,” the hospital said.
On December 31, the US Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency authorization for the surgery in the hope of saving his life.
The transplanted heart performed “very well for several weeks without any signs of rejection,” the hospital said on Wednesday.
Pigs have long been a tantalizing source of potential transplants because their organs are so similar to humans.
Prior efforts at pig-to-human transplants had failed because of genetic differences that caused organ rejection or viruses that posed an infection risk.",Reuters,"Mar 10, 2022 9:13 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/moderna-plots-vaccines-against-pathogens-future-pandemic-potential/,Moderna plots vaccines against 15 pathogens with future pandemic potential,"Moderna Inc said on Monday, March 7, it plans to develop and begin testing vaccines targeting 15 of the world’s most worrisome pathogens by 2025 and will permanently wave its COVID-19 vaccine patents for shots intended for certain low- and middle-income countries.
The US biotechnology company also said it will make its messenger RNA (mRNA) technology available to researchers working on new vaccines for emerging and neglected diseases through a program called mRNA Access.
Moderna announced its strategy ahead of the Global Pandemic Preparedness Summit sponsored by the UK government and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an international coalition set up five years ago to prepare for future disease threats.
Moderna is already collaborating with partners on vaccines against some of the 15 pathogens, which include Chikungunya, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Dengue, Ebola, Malaria, Marburg, Lassa fever, MERS, and COVID-19.
Those collaborations include a Nipah virus vaccine with the US National Institutes of Health and an HIV vaccine with the Gates Foundation and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in an interview.
The company will either seek out new partners for the others or develop them internally, he said.
Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel told a virtual press briefing on Monday that the 15 viruses are known threats that have not been addressed by many large drugmakers. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed six million people worldwide and sickened millions more, has made clear that needs to change, Bancel said.
“Too many lives were lost in the last few years,” he said.
Early in the COVID pandemic, Moderna pledged not to enforce its vaccine patents during the emergency phase of the health crisis.
That has allowed for development of a vaccine manufacturing plant in Africa backed by the World Health Organization as part of a pilot project to give poor and middle-income countries the know-how to make COVID-19 vaccines.
Moderna said it will make that pledge permanent for the 92 low- and middle income countries that qualify for assistance under the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC) led by the GAVI vaccine alliance.
A company spokesperson said Moderna will not enforce patents for COVID-19 vaccines developed in South Africa by WHO-backed Afrigen Biologics for AMC-92 low- and middle-income countries.
Although it will not enforce its patents in these countries, Hoge said Moderna does not intend to share its vaccine technology with the WHO-backed technology transfer hub in South Africa, in spite of lobbying efforts by the organization.
Earlier on Monday, the company said it will set up a manufacturing facility in Kenya, its first in Africa, to produce mRNA vaccines, including against COVID-19.
As part of its future pandemic plan, Moderna intends to make its technology available to academic research labs to test their own theories for vaccines to address emerging and neglected diseases. Hoge said some of these may eventually result in partnerships with Moderna to address the 15 priority pathogens.
“What we want to make sure happens is that scientists who have great ideas for how they could make vaccines will be able to access our standards and technology, almost as if they worked at Moderna,” Hoge said.
Initially, the program will start with a few academic labs, but Hoge expects it to expand rapidly. He sees the program as a way to expand discovery of vaccines using mRNA technology.
“We want to make sure that we allow others to explore the space that frankly, we can’t get to,” he said. “And that’s really what this is about.”",Reuters,"Mar 8, 2022 12:03 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/8-changes-world-needs-live-with-covid/,8 changes the world needs to make to live with COVID,"More and more people have been asking for a return to normal, and with omicron waning, governments are starting to act. The UK, for example, is removing its remaining public health measures, including mandatory self-isolation of COVID cases and free testing. However, the inescapable truth is that – unless the virus mutates to a milder form – the “normal” life we are returning to will be shorter and sicker on average than before.
We’ve added a new significant disease to our population. COVID is often compared to flu, as if adding a burden equivalent to flu to a population were fine (it isn’t). In fact, COVID has been and remains worse. COVID’s infection fatality rate – the proportion of people who die once they’ve caught it – was initially about 10 times higher than for flu. Treatments, vaccines and prior infections have since brought the fatality rate down, but it’s still almost twice as high as for flu – and yes, this still holds for omicron.
The impact is then worsened because COVID is so much more transmissible. It also has a similar or worse longer-term impact on the heart, lungs, and mental health than other respiratory diseases, and a higher rate of long-term symptoms. Vaccines have been incredibly effective at reducing severe illness and death, but they’re not perfect. New variants have tested vaccine defences, and protection against infection – and to a lesser extent severe illness – wanes after a few months.
While we’re unlikely to lose all protection against severe illness and death, the sort of return to normal being attempted in countries such as the UK, Denmark and Norway will result in many people facing repeated COVID reinfections over the coming years. The large majority will cope, but some will die, and more will be left with lasting ill health. Many with mild illness will still need time off work or education, and as we have seen with omicron, the aggregate effects can be hugely disruptive.
In short, the world pre-2020 no longer exists – we may want it to, but it just doesn’t.
The last 150 years have seen vast improvements in public health, with dramatic reductions in deaths from malnutrition, infectious diseases, environmental diseases, smoking and road traffic accidents to name a few.
For communal problems we have developed communal solutions, from vaccines to controls on pollution, passive smoking, unsafe driving and other ills. There’s nothing normal about upending decades of progress by simply accepting a serious new disease like COVID without actively attempting to mitigate it.
The good news is that we can mitigate it. We can accept that the world has changed and make adaptations based on what we have learned from the last two years. Here are eight key changes that can reduce the future impact of COVID:
Outdoors is pretty safe – so let’s make indoor air as much like the outdoors as possible. This will involve large investment in infrastructure to improve ventilation and to filter and clean the air. This isn’t simple, but neither was bringing clean water and electricity to every home. We know how to do it and it will be effective against any future variant and any airborne disease.
Vaccines remain crucial. We need to vaccinate the world as soon as possible to save lives and slow down the emergence of new variants. We also need to keep working towards vaccines that are longer lasting and more variant proof.
We’ve learned that acting sooner rather than later is crucial to containing outbreaks and preventing spread to other countries. So we need to invest in global surveillance of new COVID variants and other new infectious diseases.
Most countries already have routine surveillance for serious infectious diseases (such as flu and measles) and plans in place to mitigate their impact. Countries need to add permanent surveillance of COVID infection rates to existing programmes, to keep track of how much COVID is circulating, where and in which communities.
We still know too little about the long-term impacts of COVID, though we do know it can cause long-lasting organ damage and result in long COVID. We need to invest in understanding, preventing and treating these impacts.
Many health systems were already struggling before COVID hit, and have since had their resilience further depleted by the pandemic. Investment in health systems is urgently needed, particularly in winter seasons where the additional burden of COVID will be most acutely felt.
COVID has hit the most disadvantaged the hardest. Those least able to afford to self-isolate are also more likely to work outside the home, use public transport and live in overcrowded housing – all risk factors for catching the virus. Increased exposure is coupled with lower vaccination rates and poorer health among disadvantaged groups, leading to worse outcomes if infected. Countries need to invest more in reducing inequalities: in health, housing, workplaces, sick pay and education. This will make all of us more resilient to future outbreaks and reduce ill health and death – not just from COVID but everything else too.
Finally, there will still be future waves of COVID – the above will simply reduce their frequency and scale. We need to have a plan to deal with these. Excellent national surveillance systems will help rapidly identify an outbreak and understand how much ill health is being caused and immunity evaded – all of which will help tailor an appropriate temporary response. A response might, for instance, include escalating testing, reintroducing masks and working from home where possible.
Such plans should enable us to avoid long widespread lockdowns. Refusing to learn to live with COVID by pretending the old normal exists is in fact the biggest risk for future lockdowns.
We need to move on from the denial and anger stages of grief and on to accepting that the world is different now. Then, we can take control and build a way of living that is designed to contain the virus while allowing all of us – including the clinically vulnerable – to lead freer and more healthy lives. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/business/how-marketing-formula-milk-influences-decisions-infant-feeding-report-2022/,Baby formula makers still breaking global marketing rules – report,"LONDON, United Kingdom – Almost all parents and pregnant women in China, Vietnam, and the United Kingdom are exposed to “aggressive” formula milk marketing campaigns that breach global rules set up after scandals more than 40 years ago, according to a new report.
The marketing techniques can push women away from breastfeeding and include everything from giving free samples, to executives setting up or joining “moms’ groups” on popular messaging apps, the report from the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and M&C Saatchi said.
Health workers are also targeted, with gifts, funding for research, and even commission from sales, all practices that are banned under international guidelines for the marketing of formula milk.
The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for newborns, where possible, as the healthier option.
The report’s authors and several external experts said it was time to reform the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. The code was set up by the WHO in 1981 in a bid to regulate the industry after scandals in the 1970s when Nestle was accused of discouraging mothers, particularly in developing countries, from breastfeeding.
Nigel Rollins, lead author of the report and a WHO scientist, told Reuters in an interview: “Are there areas for strengthening the code? Unquestionably.”
Formula milk and tobacco are the only two products for which there are international guidelines to prevent marketing.
Despite this, only 25 countries have fully implemented the code into legislation, and over the last four decades, sales of formula milk have more than doubled, while breastfeeding rates have only slightly increased, the WHO said. The formula milk industry is now worth $55 billion annually.
The report found that more than half of the 8,500 parents across the eight countries surveyed – Bangladesh, China, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam – reported exposure to marketing, much of which was in breach of the code.
Titled “How marketing of formula milk influences our decisions on infant feeding,” the report also included interviews with marketing executives and 300 health workers, and is the largest of its kind.
In China, 97% of women surveyed had been exposed to formula milk marketing; in the United Kingdom it was 84%; and in Vietnam, 92%. More than a third of women across all of the countries said that health workers had recommended a specific brand of formula to them.
While the code allows factual information about formula to be provided, and the authors acknowledged the importance of formula milk for women who cannot or do not want to breastfeed, they said the marketing practices were a key reason for low breastfeeding rates worldwide.
The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for at least the first six months of life, but at the moment, only 44% of babies this age are fed this way.
A major study in 2016 suggested more than 800,000 babies’ lives could be saved annually if breastfeeding rates improved to reach this milestone.
“False and misleading messages about formula feeding are a substantial barrier to breastfeeding, which we know is best for babies and mothers,” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement.
Rollins said digital marketing in particular needs work, because of the potential for personalized targeted messaging and because it is now a major area of expansion for formula milk companies, alongside milks for older children and milks for allergies.
In a statement on behalf of the companies, the International Special Dietary Foods Industries said its members complied with all laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate.
“Our members support efforts by national governments to ensure compliance with all national laws and regulations. Our members are ready to work together with all stakeholders to support optimal infant health and well-being,” it added.
The WHO declined to comment on individual companies, and does not name them in the report, but said that there were no substantial differences between their practices.
However, an index compiled by the Access to Nutrition Initiative in 2021 found that some companies were more compliant with the code than others: for example, Danone’s marketing is 68% in line with the rules, and Nestle, 57%. However, three of the leading companies operating in China – Feihe, Mengniu, and Yili – all scored zero.
Marie Chantal Messier, head of food and industry affairs at Nestle, said the company supports laws on the marketing of infant formula in all countries and has policies in place.
The company does not promote formula for infants aged 0-12 months in 163 countries and will stop promoting it for infants aged 0-6 months globally by year-end, she said.
In an emailed statement, Danone said it complies with the WHO code as implemented in national legislation and has a strict global policy for marketing infant formulas which includes a ban on advertising or promoting formulas for children aged 0-6 months.
Mengniu declined to comment on the report while Yili and Feihe did not respond to requests for comment.
External experts said that wider reform was needed to bring all companies, and countries, into line, as well as tougher punishments for those who break or skirt the rules.
Gerard Hastings, emeritus professor of marketing at the University of Stirling, Scotland, said regulators like the Food and Drug Administration should be more involved.
“We need to rethink how to actually make it (the code) work, so that it can be enforced much more strongly,” he told Reuters.
“These agencies really need to go back to the drawing board and think of infant formula products in the same way as you would think of drugs.”",Reuters,"Feb 23, 2022 10:45 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/covax-covid-19-vaccine-supply-outstrips-demand-first-time/,COVAX vaccine supply outstrips demand for the first time,"The global project to share COVID-19 vaccines is struggling to place more than 300 million doses in the latest sign the problem with vaccinating the world is now more about demand than supply.
Last year, wealthy nations snapped most of the available shots to inoculate their own citizens first, meaning less than a third of people in low-income countries have been vaccinated so far compared with more than 70% in richer nations.
As supply and donations have ramped up, however, poorer nations are facing hurdles such as gaps in cold-chain shortage, vaccine hesitancy, and a lack of money to support distribution networks, public health officials told Reuters.
In January, COVAX, the global vaccine program run by Gavi and the World Health Organization (WHO), had 436 million vaccines to allocate to countries, according to a document published in mid-February.
But low-income nations only asked for 100 million doses for distribution by the end of May – the first time in 14 allocation rounds that supply has outstripped demand, the document from the COVAX Independent Allocation of Vaccines Group said.
Asked to comment, a Gavi spokesperson said COVAX was now in a situation where there was enough current supply to meet demand, but acknowledged that the roll-out of vaccines was an issue in several less developed nations.
“We will only close the vaccine equity gap once and for all if we are able to help countries roll out vaccines rapidly and at scale,” the spokesperson said.
Vaccines that are not assigned by COVAX in this round can be allocated again later.
While wealthy countries are opening up their economies, the WHO and other public health experts warn that the slow roll-out of vaccines in poorer regions will give the coronavirus a chance to mutate again and potentially create new variants.
The low demand for vaccines in the January allocation is partly explained by recent increases in supplies. COVAX has already assigned tens of millions of doses to be delivered in the first quarter and delivered its billionth dose in January.
Officials involved in vaccine distribution said that meant countries were reluctant to take on more doses that they would not be able to use.
A summit to address distribution challenges is taking place on Wednesday in Abuja, Nigeria, convened by the African Union’s Africa Vaccine Delivery Alliance with WHO, Gavi and others rolling out shots across Africa attending.
There had been hopes that African countries would be able to administer billions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines given their experience in dealing with deadly diseases from Ebola to malaria.
But two years into the crisis, a survey seen by Reuters by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in January on the equipment needed to ramp up vaccine distribution highlighted some of the challenges.
It found “critical gaps” across 44 of the African Union’s 55 member states: 24 countries said they needed fridges, 18 were in need of deep freezers, 22 required walk-in freezers and 16 did not have sufficient walk-in cold rooms.
A UNICEF spokesperson said more than 800 ultra-cold chain freezers had already been delivered to nearly 70 countries, as well as 52,000 fridges.
“We are continuing to help countries identify and close cold chain capacity gaps as supply increases and governments adjust national-level vaccination targets in response,” she said.
The problem is particularly acute for COVAX because the Pfizer-BioNTech shot that needs to be kept super-cold has replaced AstraZeneca’s vaccine as the main one being offered by the global program.
Some African countries, such as Burundi and Guinea, have gaps at every point in the cold chain, from national level to local distribution centers, the UNICEF survey showed.
The findings are likely to underscore growing concerns that COVAX did not invest quickly enough in infrastructure and equipment for countries it was delivering vaccines to.
The issue is exacerbated by a lack of funding and because countries have not had enough notice of deliveries – particularly donations – making it harder for them to plan vaccination campaigns, public health officials have said.
Officials involved in the distribution of vaccines in Africa also said more focus needed to be placed on communicating the importance of getting vaccinated – and addressing disinformation.
“Communication is one of the biggest issues… if we don’t get the messaging right, everything else we are doing is futile,” one of the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Money has also started to dry up for global initiatives as richer nations seek to move on from COVID-19.
Gavi says it has only raised $195 million out of the $5.2 billion it has asked for this quarter. The money is used to procure and ship vaccines, as well as provide syringes and delivery support in countries.",Reuters,"Feb 23, 2022 3:05 PM PHT"

A study by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) of some 67,200 infections confirmed since December showed the Omicron variant’s severity and death rates averaged 0.38% and 0.18%, respectively, compared with 1.4% and 0.7% for the Delta cases.
The KDCA classed severe cases as people who were hospitalized in intensive care units.
Around 56% of 1,073 people who died over the past five weeks were either unvaccinated or had received only one dose, the study showed, with people aged 60 or older accounting for 94% of deaths.
More than 86% of South Korea’s 52 million population have been double vaccinated and nearly 60% have received a booster shot.
South Korea had kept cases and deaths relatively low thanks to widespread social distancing measures and aggressive testing and tracing.
The Omicron variant has led to a surge in cases – daily new infections topped a record 100,000 last week – but authorities have pushed ahead with slightly easing social distancing rules amid the lower fatality rate and ahead of a presidential election next month.
Contact tracing and mandatory isolation for vaccinated people was scrapped in favor of self diagnosis and at-home treatment to free up medical resources. Among changes to strict curfews, restaurants will be open for an extra hour for groups of up to eight diners, up from six.
The long-running curfews have emerged as a political hot potato ahead of the election, with small business owners urging them to be lifted while some experts warn of likely strain on the medical system.
The KDCA said Omicron became the dominant variant in the third week of January and up to 90% of new cases were Omicron by the first week of February.
The KDCA reported 99,444 new cases for Monday, bringing total infections to 2,157,734, with 7,508 deaths.",Reuters,"Feb 22, 2022 2:21 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/research-countries-focus-most-on-happiness-can-make-people-feel-worse/,Research finds countries that focus the most on happiness can end up making people feel worse,"Have you looked at the international rankings of the world’s happiest countries lately?
Measuring a country’s subjective levels of happiness has become something of an international sport. People look with interest (and a little jealousy) to nations such as Denmark, which consistently tops the world happiness rankings.
It has also led to Danish practices such as the “hygge” lifestyle gaining popularity elsewhere. If only we could add more cosiness to our lives, perhaps we would be as happy as the Danish!
But is living in one of the worlds happiest nations all it’s cracked up to be? What happens if you struggle to find or maintain happiness in a sea of (supposedly) happy people?
In our new research, published in Scientific Reports, we found that in countries which rank the highest in national happiness, people are also more likely to experience poor well-being due to the societal pressure to be happy.
So living in happier countries may be good for many. But for some, it can end up feeling like too much to live up to, and have the opposite effect.
For several years, my colleagues and I have been researching the social pressure people may feel to experience positive emotions and avoid negative ones.
This pressure is also communicated to us through channels such as social media, self-help books and advertising. Eventually people develop a sense of what kinds of emotion are valued (or not valued) by those around them.
In an ironic twist, our past research has shown that the more people experience pressure to feel happy and not sad, the more they tend to experience depression.
While this previous research has mostly focused on people living in Australia or the United States, we were curious about how these effects might also be evident in other countries.
For our latest study we surveyed 7,443 people from 40 countries on their emotional well-being, satisfaction with life (cognitive well-being) and mood complaints (clinical well-being). We then weighed this against their perception of social pressure to feel positive.
What we found confirmed our previous findings. Worldwide, when people report feeling pressure to experience happiness and avoid sadness, they tend to experience deficits in mental health.
That is, they experience lower satisfaction with their lives, more negative emotion, less positive emotion and higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress.
Interestingly, our global sample allowed us to go beyond our prior work and examine whether there were differences in this relationship across countries. Are there some countries in which this relationship is especially strong? And if so, why might that be?
To investigate this, we obtained data for each of the 40 counties from the World Happiness Index, collected by the Gallup World Poll. This index is based on the subjective happiness ratings of large-scale nationally representative samples.
It allowed us to determine how the overall happiness of a nation, and therefore the social pressure on individuals to be happy, might influence individuals’ well-being.
We found the relationship did indeed change, and was stronger in countries that ranked more highly on the World Happiness Index. That is, in countries such as Denmark, the social pressure some people felt to be happy was especially predictive of poor mental health.
That’s not to say on average people are not happier in those countries – apparently they are – but that for those who already feel a great deal of pressure to keep their chin up, living in happier nations can lead to poorer well-being.
Why might this be the case? We reasoned that being surrounded by a sea of happy faces may aggravate the effects of already feeling socially pressured to be happy.
Of course, signs of others’ happiness are not limited to the explicit expression of happiness, but are also evident in other more subtle cues, such as having more social contact or engaging in pleasurable activities. These signals tend to be stronger in happier countries, ratcheting up the effects of social expectations.
In these countries, feeling happy can easily be viewed as the expected norm.  This adds to the social pressure people feel to adhere to this norm, and exacerbates the fallout for those who fail to achieve it.
So what can we do? At a personal level, feeling and expressing happiness is a good thing. But as other research has found, it’s sometimes good to be sensitive about how our expression of positive emotion may affect others.
While it’s good to bring happiness and positivity to our interactions, it’s also good to know when to tone it down – and avoid alienating those who may not share our joy in the moment.
More broadly, perhaps it’s time to rethink how we measure national well-being. We already know that flourishing in life isn’t just about positive emotion, but also about responding well to negative emotion, finding value in discomfort, and focusing on other factors such as meaning and interpersonal connection.
Perhaps it’s time to rank countries not only by how happy they are, but how safe and open they are to the full range of human experiences. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/moderna-eyes-covid-19-booster-august/,"Moderna eyes COVID-19 booster by August, not clear yet if Omicron-specific needed","BRUSSELS, Belgium – An Omicron-specific booster could be ready by August, the CEO of US biotech firm Moderna told Reuters, but the firm is still gathering clinical data to determine whether that vaccine would offer better protection than a new dose of the existing jab.
Last month Moderna began clinical trials for a booster dose specifically designed to target Omicron but initial results from studies in monkeys show the Omicron-specific shot may not offer stronger protection than a new dose of the existing vaccine.
Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said in an interview the company aimed to have a booster ready by August 2022, before next autumn when he said more vulnerable people may need it.
Moderna’s vaccines use mRNA technology to provoke an immune response, similar to the shot developed by Pfizer/BioNTech.
“We believe a booster will be needed. I don’t know yet if it is going to be the existing vaccine, Omicron-only, or bivalent: Omicron and existing vaccine, two mRNA in one dose.”
He said a decision would be made in the coming months when clinical data becomes available.
Bancel also confirmed that under the best-case scenario Moderna would have ready by August 2023 a so-called pan-vaccine which would protect simultaneously against COVID-19, flu and other respiratory diseases.
He added that pricing for this vaccine under development would be “very similar” to that applied to the current vaccine.
Moderna charges different prices for different regions of the world with a range between $15 and $37, according to UNICEF, a United Nations agency involved in the distribution of vaccines to poorer nations.
Separately, Moderna announced plans to expand its commercial network in Europe in a bid to increase sales on the continent.
“Moderna plans to establish a commercial presence in Belgium, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden to support the delivery of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics locally,” the company said in a statement.
These new European subsidiaries will be added to commercial offices in Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and Britain. Moderna is also boosting its commercial presence in Asia.
In Europe, Moderna produces its vaccines through manufacturing partnerships which include Lonza in Switzerland and the Netherlands, ROVI in Spain and Recipharm in France.
The company shipped last year more than 800 million COVID-19 shots globally and has deals with EU countries for the supply of up to 460 million doses.
Besides vaccines, Moderna is also developing mRNA drugs against a range of conditions including cancer, cardiovascular and rare genetic diseases.",Reuters,"Feb 17, 2022 9:03 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/china-potential-mrna-covid-19-vaccine-weaker-against-omicron/,China’s potential mRNA COVID-19 vaccine weaker against Omicron – study,"BEIJING, China – A Chinese mRNA vaccine candidate showed a sharp drop in neutralizing antibody activity against Omicron in a small study, but a booster readily induced antibody production in animal tests, researchers said.
The ARCoV vaccine, jointly developed by the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Suzhou Abogen Biosciences and Walvax Biotechnology, is being tested in an international Phase III clinical trial.
It is China’s locally developed mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccine candidate furthest along in trial progress. The country has yet to approve mRNA vaccines developed locally or overseas, but has vaccinated 87.1% of its population using several domestically developed shots based on other technologies.
In a lab study analyzing samples from 11 vaccinated people, eight demonstrated “low but detectable” neutralization activity against Omicron, researchers said in a letter to editors published in the journal Cell Research.
The neutralizing antibody level against Omicron showed a 47-fold reduction compared with the level against a “wild-type” that contains no major mutations, said the paper published on Monday.
But in animal tests, a third dose, given about nine months after the second shot, readily induced the production of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron and a wild-type strain, it said.
“Our data presented here clearly demonstrate that a third dose of ARCoV would probably lead to a sharp increase in neutralisation antibodies not only against the WT (wild type) SARS-CoV-2 but also the newly Omicron variant,” the study said.
China, which is battling small but constant outbreaks of COVID-19 infections, has boosted around one third of its 1.4 billion people, using non-mRNA shots.
The researchers said they also conducted animal tests on two new mRNA vaccine candidates targeting Omicron and the result showed that the induced antibody levels were comparable to those elicited by the original ARCoV.
Authors of the paper include scientists from AMMS and Suzhou Abogen Biosciences, as well as researchers with other Chinese institutes.
A Walvax executive said last month it had recruited most of the 28,000 participants it planned for the Phase III trial and was now looking to focus more on identifying COVID-19 infections among trial participants for data analysis.",Reuters,"Feb 16, 2022 11:14 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/first-woman-reported-cured-hiv-stem-cell-transplant/,First woman reported cured of HIV after stem cell transplant,"CHICAGO, USA – A US patient with leukemia has become the first woman and the third person to date to be cured of HIV after receiving a stem cell transplant from a donor who was naturally resistant to the virus that causes AIDS, researchers reported on Tuesday.
The case of a middle-aged woman of mixed race, presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunisitic Infections in Denver, is also the first involving umbilical cord blood, a newer approach that may make the treatment available to more people.
Since receiving the cord blood to treat her acute myeloid leukemia – a cancer that starts in blood-forming cells in the bone marrow – the woman has been in remission and free of the virus for 14 months, without the need for potent HIV treatments known as antiretroviral therapy.
The two prior cases occurred in males – one white and one Latino – who had received adult stem cells, which are more frequently used in bone marrow transplants.
“This is now the third report of a cure in this setting, and the first in a woman living with HIV,” Sharon Lewin, President-Elect of the International AIDS Society, said in a statement.
The case is part of a larger US-backed study led by Dr. Yvonne Bryson of the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), and Dr. Deborah Persaud of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. It aims to follow 25 people with HIV who undergo a transplant with stem cells taken from umbilical cord blood for the treatment of cancer and other serious conditions.
Patients in the trial first undergo chemotherapy to kill off the cancerous immune cells. Doctors then transplant stem cells from individuals with a specific genetic mutation in which they lack receptors used by the virus to infect cells.
Scientists believe these individuals then develop an immune system resistant to HIV.
Lewin said bone marrow transplants are not a viable strategy to cure most people living with HIV. But the report “confirms that a cure for HIV is possible and further strengthens using gene therapy as a viable strategy for an HIV cure,” she said.
The study suggests that an important element to the success is the transplantation of HIV-resistant cells. Previously, scientists believed that a common stem cell transplant side effect called graft-versus-host disease, in which the donor immune system attacks the recipient’s immune system, played a role in a possible cure.
“Taken together, these three cases of a cure post stem cell transplant all help in teasing out the various components of the transplant that were absolutely key to a cure,” Lewin said.",Reuters,"Feb 16, 2022 10:00 AM PHT"

Diana famously shook hands with AIDS patients at a London hospital in 1987, an action that was seen as a milestone in the battle against the stigma surrounding people with the virus, and Harry has also become a prominent HIV and AIDS campaigner.
“My mum’s work was unfinished,” he told former Wales rugby union captain Gareth Thomas, who announced in 2019 he was HIV positive, in a video to mark National HIV Testing Week.
“I feel obligated to try and continue that as much as possible. I could never, you know, fill her shoes especially in this particular space … because of what she did and what she stood for and how vocal she was about this issue.”
The World Health Organization estimates that there were about 38 million people living with HIV at the end of 2020, and that AIDS-related illnesses had claimed more than 36 million lives since it began in the 1980s.
Leading HIV/AIDS charities are hoping that wider testing could lead to an end to new HIV cases in England by 2030.
Harry underwent a test for HIV in 2016, which sparked 500% increase in requests for tests from one charity, he said. But he said HIV testing had gone down about 30% during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Every single one of us has a duty, or at least an opportunity, to get tested ourselves to make it easier for everybody else to get tested,” Harry said. “And then it just becomes a regular thing like anything else.”",Reuters,"Feb 10, 2022 11:48 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/discovery-omicron-new-york-deer-concern-possible-new-covid-19-variants/,Discovery of Omicron in New York deer raises concern over possible new variants,"NEW YORK, USA – The discovery of the Omicron variant in white-tailed deer in New York has raised concerns the species, numbering 30 million in the United States, could become hosts of a new coronavirus strain, a lead researcher said on Tuesday, February 8.
Blood and some nasal swab samples from 131 deer captured on New York’s Staten Island revealed that nearly 15% had virus antibodies. The finding suggested that the animals had previous coronavirus infections and were vulnerable to repeated reinfections with new variants, researchers led by Pennsylvania State University scientists said.
“Circulation of the virus in an animal population always raises the possibility of getting back to humans, but more importantly it provides more opportunities for the virus to evolve into novel variants,” said Suresh Kuchipudi, a Penn State veterinary microbiologist.
“When the virus completely mutates, then it can escape the protection of the current vaccine. So we’d have to change the vaccine again,” Kuchipudi said.
The discovery – the first time Omicron was detected in a wild animal – comes as a surge in COVID-19 infections fueled by the variant are abating among the US human population.
While there is no evidence that animals are transmitting the virus to humans, most coronavirus infections were reported in species that had close contact with a person with COVID-19, according to the US Department of Agriculture.
In August, the US government said it found the world’s first cases of COVID-19 in wild deer in Ohio, expanding the list of animals known to have tested positive for the disease.
The finding was based on samples collected from deer months before the heavily mutated variant Omicron emerged to replace the previously dominant Delta variant in people in countries around the world.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/easing-curbs-covid-19-zero-regions-could-cause-millions-death-yearly-china-study/,Easing curbs in ‘COVID-zero regions’ could cause 2 million deaths in a year – China study,"SHANGHAI, China – Restoring normal population mobility to “COVID-zero regions” like China will cause some 2 million deaths in a year and the key to controlling the virus is developing vaccines that are better at preventing infection, Chinese researchers said.
China’s “zero-COVID” restrictions have come under growing scrutiny in recent weeks as it hosts the Winter Olympics in Beijing while using sweeping restrictions to try to prevent the spread of the more infectious Omicron variant.
Chinese scientists and public health specialists have reiterated the need for maintaining the stringent controls, saying the risks of transmission were too high and that mass infection would put intolerable pressure on the health system.
The researchers used studies from Chile and Britain to calculate the “baseline efficacy” of current vaccines – CoronaVac in the case of Chile and the Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca shots in Britain.
They estimated the baseline efficacy against symptomatic disease of the vaccines was 68.3%. They estimated the baseline efficacy of existing vaccines against death was 86%.
The efficacy estimate against infection is based on British data and efficacy against symptomatic disease and deaths was based on data extracted from a study on Sinovac’s CoronaVac in Chile.
But even with a global vaccination rate of 95%, if population mobility was restored to 2019 levels, the researchers estimated that all COVID-zero regions would see more than 234 million infections within a year, including 64 million symptomatic cases and 2 million deaths.
“The human race should continue to develop vaccines and explore new ways to improve vaccine protection against infection in order to eliminate COVID-19 at the global level,” the team of Chinese scientists said in a paper, published on Friday, February 4, in the weekly bulletin of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC).
In order to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 to the levels of influenza after restoring normal mobility, the efficacy of vaccines against infection needs to be increased to 40% and the efficacy against symptomatic disease needs to be increased to 90%, they said.
They said it was more important for new vaccines to be effective against infection than against symptomatic disease or death.
“The key to controlling COVID-19 lies in the development and widespread use of vaccines that are more effective at preventing infection,” the team said.
China is the only major economy sticking with a zero-COVID-19 policy despite warnings that it could hurt growth. Others, like Singapore, Australia and New Zealand, have abandoned the strategy in favor of what policymakers call “learning to live with COVID.”
China has doubled down on its zero-COVID-19 message and continues to seal off entire cities, the latest being Baise in the southern region of Guangxi. The Beijing Winter Olympics are being held in a “closed-loop” bubble that some athletes have branded as excessive.
“We previously thought COVID-19 could be basically contained through vaccines but now it seems that there’s no simple method to control it except with comprehensive measures,” the CCDC’s chief epidemiologist Wu Zunyou told the Communist Party-run Global Times on Sunday.",Reuters,"Feb 7, 2022 2:20 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-recommends-covid-19-treatments-sotrovimab-baricitinib-how-they-work/,COVID-19: WHO recommends two new treatments – here’s how they work,"Back in early 2020, if you got ill with COVID-19 there were no proven treatments for doctors to give you – it was one of the main things that made this disease so scary. Fast forward to 2021 and scientists have since uncovered a handful of options, but the hunt is continuing. More than 5,000 trials for COVID-19 drugs are registered or ongoing.
Thankfully, these are now bearing fruit. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently added two additional drugs to its COVID-19 treatment guidelines.
COVID-19 disease is thought to be driven by two processes. In the early stages, illness is primarily caused by the virus replicating in the body. But after this, some people also experience severe illness caused by the immune system’s response to the virus running out of control. One of the newly recommended drugs deals with the initial issue and the other with the latter.
The first is sotrovimab, a human monoclonal antibody. These are molecules made in a lab that act as substitute antibodies. They help our immune system identify and respond more efficiently to threats such as viruses, making it harder for them to reproduce and cause harm. Sotrovimab is a direct counter to the coronavirus itself.
Sotrovimab targets a specific, identifiable part of the virus’s outer surface called the spike protein, which is what the virus uses – a bit like a key in a lock – to get inside the body’s cells. By sticking to the spike protein, sotrovimab prevents the virus from invading cells. Without access to them, the virus can’t reproduce.
Importantly, sotrovimab is able to work against several different variants of the coronavirus, including Omicron (though research on this is still in preprint, so is yet to be reviewed). Sotrovimab is able to do this because it targets a part of the spike protein that doesn’t tend to mutate, meaning that it remains effective against the virus as it evolves.
The other drug recommended by the WHO is baricitinib. It’s what’s known as a janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, an immunosuppressant drug traditionally used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. It works by inhibiting the proteins JAK 1 and JAK 2, which are important for the body’s production of inflammatory molecules called cytokines. People who get seriously ill with COVID-19 often do so because they develop uncontrolled inflammation as the body responds to the virus, creating too many cytokines – what’s known as “cytokine storm.”
This overzealous immune response can cause the body to damage its own tissues, potentially leading to multi-organ failure – including severe lung damage and the development of a condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) – which can kill.
Helpfully, baricitinib also has antiviral properties, with studies showing it can block the reproduction of the coronavirus as well as keep the immune system’s response in check.
The WHO recommends sotrovimab for patients who don’t yet have severe COVID-19 but are at a high risk of being hospitalized. This includes people who are unvaccinated, older people and people with certain conditions that raise the risk of developing severe COVID-19, such as obesity, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of giving these people sotrovimab is to stop their COVID-19 getting worse and sending them into hospital.
This recommendation was informed by a trial that involved just over a thousand unhospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19. Sotrovimab was shown to reduce hospitalisation and death by 85% in patients receiving a single intravenous infusion of the drug compared to a placebo. Sotrovimab was most effective when taken during the early stages of infection – it should be given within five days of symptoms appearing.
Sotrovimab was also tested in around 500 patients already in hospital with severe COVID-19. However, their condition didn’t improve as a result of taking the drug – so it isn’t recommended for those who are already seriously ill.
Rather, the WHO strongly recommends using baricitinib (in combination with corticosteroids) for such patients. For patients with severe COVID-19, baricitinib has been shown to reduce mortality and decrease how long they stay in hospital.
Vaccines have been successful in preventing hospitalizations, but it’s uncertain how long protection after vaccination (or natural infection) lasts. There’s also the worry that immunity could be side-stepped by new variants of the virus that emerge. Therefore, the need for drugs to treat people with COVID-19 remains high.
Sotrovimab isn’t the only drug that targets the coronavirus directly. There are antivirals (such as molnupiravir) as well as other monoclonal antibodies (such as casirivimab-imdevimab) available for use in the UK as well. However, early lab-based studies (still in preprint) suggest that casirivimab-imdevimab isn’t effective against omicron but that sotrovimab is. So it’s good to have sotrovimab as an alternative.
Baricitinib also isn’t the only drug that’s been authorized to tame the immune response in patients with severe COVID-19. Other immunosuppressive drugs, such as tocilizumab and sarilumab, are available in the UK as well. Currently, there’s not enough information to determine if there’s a benefit of taking one drug over another, so the WHO suggests choosing whatever’s most appropriate based on cost, availability, route of administration and the experience of the doctor.
However, it’s worth noting that baricitinib can be taken orally, whereas these other immunosuppressive drugs need to be given intravenously. In certain situations, this might allow for baricitinib to be given when other drugs can’t – or perhaps more quickly.
In time, though, all of these drugs may be superseded by new ones, as the hunt for the best COVID-19 treatments is far from over. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/south-africa-afrigen-makes-mrna-covid-vaccine-using-moderna-data/,"In world first, South Africa’s Afrigen makes mRNA COVID vaccine using Moderna data","CAPE TOWN, South Africa – South Africa’s Afrigen Biologics has used the publicly available sequence of Moderna Inc’s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to make its own version of the shot, which could be tested in humans before the end of this year, Afrigen’s top executive said on Thursday, February 3.
The vaccine candidate would be the first to be made based on a widely used vaccine without the assistance and approval of the developer. It is also the first mRNA vaccine designed, developed and produced at lab scale on the African continent.
The World Health Organization (WHO) last year picked a consortium including Afrigen for a pilot project to give poor and middle-income countries the know-how to make COVID vaccines, after market leaders of the mRNA COVID vaccine, Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna, declined a WHO request to share their technology and expertise.
The WHO and consortium partners hope their technology transfer hub will help overcome inequalities between rich nations and poorer countries in getting access to vaccines. Some 99% of Africa’s vaccines against all diseases are imported and the negligible remainder manufactured locally.
During the pandemic, wealthy countries have hoovered up most of the world’s supplies of vaccines.
Biovac, a partly state-owned South African vaccine producer, will be the first recipient of the technology from the hub. Afrigen has also agreed to help train companies in Argentina and Brazil.
In September, the WHO’s hub in Cape Town decided to go it alone after failing to bring on board Pfizer and Moderna, both of which have argued they need to oversee any technology transfer due to the complexity of the manufacturing process.
Moderna had no immediate comment on Afrigen’s announcement on Thursday.
Moderna’s vaccine was chosen by the WHO due to an abundance of public information and the company’s pledge not to enforce patents during the pandemic. It’s not clear what will happen after the pandemic ends and whether the company will try to enforce them again.
“If this project shows that Africa can take cutting edge technology and produce cutting-edge products, this will banish this idea that Africa can’t do it and change the global mindset…this can be a game-changer,” Charles Gore, executive director at MPP, told Reuters at Afrigen’s facility, a converted warehouse.
Under pressure to make drugs in lower-income countries, Moderna and BioNTech have announced plans to build mRNA vaccine factories in Africa, but production is still a long way off.
“We haven’t copied Moderna, we’ve developed our own processes because Moderna didn’t give us any technology,” Petro Terblanche, managing director at Afrigen, told Reuters.
“We started with the Moderna sequence because that gives, in our view, the best starting material. But this is not Moderna’s vaccine, it is the Afrigen mRNA hub vaccine,” Terblanche said.
She later took a delegation of EU diplomats on a tour of the state-of-the-art facility where scientists were seen making mRNA in sterile white-walled rooms.
She said it had managed to make, in collaboration with Johannesburg’s University of the Witwatersrand, its first microliter laboratory scale batches of COVID mRNA vaccines at the Cape Town facility.
Terblanche said Afrigen was also working on a next generation mRNA vaccine that didn’t need freezing temperatures for storage, required for the Pfizer and Moderna doses, and which would be better suited to Africa, which is often dealing with high temperatures and poor health facilities and infrastructure.
“We will only make our clinical trial batch probably in six months from now, (meaning) … fit for humans. And the target is November 2022,” Terblanche added.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/huge-volumes-covid-19-hospital-waste-threaten-health/,Huge volumes of COVID-19 hospital waste threaten health – WHO,"GENEVA, Switzerland – Discarded syringes, used test kits, and old vaccine bottles from the COVID-19 pandemic have piled up to create tens of thousands of tons of medical waste, threatening human health and the environment, a World Health Organization report said on Tuesday, February 1.
The material potentially exposes health workers to burns, needle-stick injuries, and disease-causing germs, the report said.
“We found that COVID-19 has increased healthcare waste loads in facilities to up to 10 times,” Maggie Montgomery, a WHO technical officer, told Geneva-based journalists.
She said the biggest risk for affected communities was air pollution caused by burning waste at insufficiently high temperatures leading to the release of carcinogens.
The report calls for reform and investment including through the reduction in the use of packaging that has caused a rush for plastic and the use of protective gear made from reusable and recyclable materials.
The WHO report estimates that some 87,000 tons of personal protective equipment (PPE) or the equivalent of the weight of several hundred blue whales, has been ordered via a UN portal up until November 2021 – most of which is thought to have ended up as waste.
The report also mentions some 140 million test kits with a potential to generate 2,600 tons of mostly plastic trash and enough chemical waste to fill one-third of an Olympic swimming pool.
In addition, it estimates that some 8 billion vaccine doses administered globally have produced an additional 144,000 tons of waste in the form of glass vials, syringes, needles, and safety boxes.
Montgomery said a misperception about the rates of COVID-19 infection from surfaces was to blame for what she called the “overuse” of protective gear, particularly gloves.

The WHO report did not name specific examples of where the most egregious build-ups occurred but referred to challenges such as the limited waste treatment and disposal in rural India as well as large volumes of faecal sludge from quarantine facilities in Madagascar.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/many-countries-yet-see-peak-omicron-wave-should-ease-curbs-slowly-world-health-organization/,"Many countries yet to see peak in Omicron wave, should ease curbs slowly – WHO","Many countries have not reached their peak in cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus and measures imposed to curb its spread should be eased slowly, the World Health Organization’s technical lead on COVID-19 said on Tuesday, February 1.
“We are urging caution because many countries have not gone through the peak of Omicron yet. Many countries have low levels of vaccination coverage with very vulnerable individuals within their populations,” Maria Van Kerkhove told an online briefing.
“And so now is not the time to lift everything all at once. We have always urged, always (be) very cautious, in applying interventions as well as lifting those interventions in a steady and in a slow way, piece by piece. Because this virus is quite dynamic,” she added.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the U.N. agency was concerned about a narrative taking hold in some countries that “because of vaccines, and because of Omicron’s high transmissibility and lower severity, preventing transmission is no longer possible, and no longer necessary.
“Nothing could be further from the truth,” Tedros told the briefing. “More transmission means more deaths. We are not calling for any country to return to so-called lockdown. But we are calling on all countries to protect their people using every tool in the toolkit, not vaccines alone.”
He added: “It’s premature for any country to surrender or to declare victory.”
WHO’s emergencies chief Mike Ryan, addressing the same briefing, urged countries to chart their own path out of the pandemic and not blindly follow others in relaxing measures.
“I think it’s a transition phase for many countries, not every country in the same situation. Those countries who are making decisions to open up more broadly also need to be sure of capacity to reintroduce measures, with community acceptance, if needed. So as if we open the doors quickly, you better be very well able to close them very quickly as well.”
Denmark and Austria last week became the latest countries  to relax COVID-19 restrictions, after similar moves by Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands, though other European nations planned new curbs to battle record numbers of infections.
In a separate online briefing earlier on Tuesday, Dr. Boris Pavlin of WHO’s COVID-19 Response Team said the emerging BA.2 form of Omicron does not seem to be any more severe than the original BA.1 form.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/explainer-comparing-merck-pfizer-covid-19-pills/,EXPLAINER: How does Merck’s COVID-19 pill compare to Pfizer’s?,"Rival antiviral pills from Pfizer Inc and Merck & Co that demonstrated efficacy in trials of adults with COVID-19 who are at high risk of serious illness are now both in use. The drugs are being studied to see if they can prevent infection in people exposed to the virus.
Here is an explanation of the differences in the two pills.
Trial data provided by the two companies suggest that Pfizer has the more effective pill.
Pfizer in December said final trial results showed that its treatment reduced the chance of hospitalization or death by 89% in COVID-19 patients at risk of severe illness given the treatment within three days of the onset of symptoms, and by 88% when given within five days of onset.
Merck in November said its full trial results showed that molnupiravir lowered the chance of hospitalization or death by about 30% in patients at risk of severe COVID who were given the treatment within five days of developing symptoms.
An earlier, interim look at Merck’s trial on October 1  had suggested that molnupiravir halved the risk of hospitalization or death. Merck did not provide figures regarding patients getting the pill within three days of onset.
Pfizer’s two-drug regimen is being sold under the brand name Paxlovid. Merck’s drug has the brand name Lagevrio.
While a number of vaccines are available worldwide to help prevent infection and serious illness, including one made by Pfizer, there are limited treatment options for people infected with COVID-19.
Currently, COVID-19 patients who are not sick enough to be hospitalized but are at risk of serious illness can be treated with antibody drugs, though they have to be given intravenously at hospitals or infusion centers.
Antibodies developed early in the pandemic have not held up against the now dominant Omicron coronavirus variant.
Sotrovimab, from GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology, which in trials reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 85%, has shown to be effective against the highly-transmissable variant.
Gilead Sciences Inc’s intravenous antiviral drug remdesivir, sold as Veklury, was recently given emergency approval by US regulators as a three-day infusion for at-risk COVID-19 patients after it was shown to reduce their risk of hospitalization by 87%.
Both oral regimens are given for five days. Pfizer’s regimen is three pills in the morning and three pills at night. Merck’s drug is taken as four pills in the morning and four at night.
Pfizer’s drug is part of a class known as protease inhibitors designed to block an enzyme that the coronavirus needs to multiply. It is given in combination with ritonavir, an older antiviral that boosts the activity of protease inhibitors but can cause gastrointestinal side effects and interfere with certain other medications.
Merck’s pill, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, is a nucleoside analogue with a mechanism of action that aims to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus.
Both companies have said laboratory studies show that their pills are active against coronavirus infections caused by the Omicron variant.
Both companies have released only limited data on the treatments, but expressed confidence in their safety.
Pfizer said about 20% of patients who received either the pill or a placebo in trials experienced adverse events, mostly mild. Serious side effects were reported by 1.7% of patients receiving the drug and 6.6% of placebo patients.
Since the ritonavir component of Paxlovid can interfere with other medications, physicians emphasize that patients need to share an accurate list of any other drugs they are taking before being prescribed the Pfizer drug.
Merck said 12% of patients receiving its drug and 11% of placebo patients experienced drug-related adverse events.
Drugs in the same class as Merck’s pill have been linked to birth defects in animal studies. Merck has said similar studies of molnupiravir – for longer and at higher doses than used in humans – show that it does not cause birth defects or cancer.
Molnupiravir is not authorized for US patients younger than 18 years of age because it could affect bone and cartilage growth. It is also not recommended for use during pregnancy.
The US Food and Drug Administration advises that both men and women of child-bearing age be on reliable birth control while taking the Merck drug, and that it cannot be used by pregnant women.
Pfizer and Merck have said they are making efforts to expand global access to the drugs, including allowing generic drugmakers to sell lower-cost versions in low-income countries.
Pfizer has said it expects to have capacity to produce up to 120 million courses of its therapy this year.
Merck has said it could produce at least 20 million courses of its drug this year.
The US government provides vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 for free to US residents. Countries around the world are negotiating prices with Pfizer and Merck.
The United States is paying around $530 for each course of Paxlovid and $700 for each course of molnupiravir.",Reuters,"Jan 31, 2022 8:02 PM PHT"

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/mrna-dna-vaccines-treat-cancers-hiv-autoimmune-disorders-genetic-diseases/,"How mRNA and DNA vaccines could soon treat cancers, HIV, autoimmune disorders, genetic diseases","The two most successful coronavirus vaccines developed in the US – the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines – are both mRNA vaccines. The idea of using genetic material to produce an immune response has opened up a world of research and potential medical uses far out of reach of traditional vaccines. Deborah Fuller is a microbiologist at the University of Washington who has been studying genetic vaccines for more than 20 years. We spoke to her about the future of mRNA vaccines for The Conversation Weekly podcast.
Below are excerpts from that conversation which have been edited for length and clarity.
This type of vaccine has been in the works for about 30 years. Nucleic acid vaccines are based on the idea that DNA makes RNA and then RNA makes proteins. For any given protein, once we know the genetic sequence or code, we can design an mRNA or DNA molecule that prompts a person’s cells to start making it.
When we first thought about this idea of putting a genetic code into somebody’s cells, we were studying both DNA and RNA. The mRNA vaccines did not work very well at first. They were unstable and they caused pretty strong immune responses that were not necessarily desirable. For a very long time DNA vaccines took the front seat, and the very first clinical trials were with a DNA vaccine.
But about seven or eight years ago, mRNA vaccines started to take the lead. Researchers solved a lot of the problems – notably the instability – and discovered new technologies to deliver mRNA into cells and ways of modifying the coding sequence to make the vaccines a lot more safe to use in humans.
Once those problems were solved, the technology was really poised to become a revolutionary tool for medicine. This was just when COVID-19 hit.
Most vaccines induce antibody responses. Antibodies are the primary immune mechanism that blocks infections. As we began to study nucleic acid vaccines, we discovered that because these vaccines are expressed within our cells, they were also very effective at inducing a T cell response. This discovery really prompted additional thinking about how researchers could use nucleic acid vaccines not just for infectious diseases, but also for immunotherapy to treat cancers and chronic infectious diseases – like HIV, hepatitis B and herpes – as well as autoimmune disorders and even for gene therapy.
T cell responses are very important for identifying cells infected with chronic diseases and aberrant cancer cells. They also play a big role in eliminating these cells from the body.
When a cell becomes cancerous, it starts producing neoantigens. In normal cases, the immune system detects these neoantigens, recognizes that something’s wrong with the cell and eliminates it. The reason some people get tumors is that their immune system isn’t quite capable of eliminating the tumor cells, so the cells propagate.
With an mRNA or DNA vaccine, the goal is to make your body better able to recognize the very specific neoantigens the cancer cell has produced. If your immune system can recognize and see those better, it will attack the cancer cells and eliminate them from the body.
This same strategy can be applied to the elimination of chronic infections like HIV, hepatitis B and herpes. These viruses infect the human body and stay in the body forever unless the immune system eliminates them. Similar to the way nucleic acid vaccines can train the immune system to eliminate cancer cells, they can be used to train our immune cells to recognize and eliminate chronically infected cells.
Some of the very first clinical trials of nucleic acid vaccines happened in the 1990s and were for cancer, particularly for melanoma.
Today, there are a number of ongoing mRNA clinical trials for the treatment of melanoma, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, glioblastoma and others, and there have been some promising outcomes. Moderna recently announced promising results with its phase 1 trial using mRNA to treat solid tumors and lymphoma
There are also a lot of ongoing trials looking at cancer DNA vaccines, because DNA vaccines are particularly effective in inducing T cell responses. A company called Inovio recently demonstrated a significant impact on cervical cancer caused by human papilloma virus in women using a DNA vaccine.
Autoimmune disorders occur when a person’s immune cells are actually attacking a part of the person’s own body. An example of this is multiple sclerosis. If you have multiple sclerosis, your own immune cells are attacking myelin, a protein that coats the nerve cells in your muscles.
The way to eliminate an autoimmune disorder is to modulate your immune cells to prevent them from attacking your own proteins. In contrast to vaccines, whose goal is to stimulate the immune system to better recognize something, treatment for autoimmune diseases seeks to dampen the immune system so that it stops attacking something it shouldn’t. Recently, researchers created an mRNA vaccine encoding a myelin protein with slightly tweaked genetic instructions to prevent it from stimulating immune responses. Instead of activating normal T cells that increase immune responses, the vaccine caused the body to produce T regulatory cells that specifically suppressed only the T cells that were attacking myelin.
The last application is actually one of the very first things that researchers thought about using DNA and mRNA vaccines for: gene therapy. Some people are born missing certain genes. The goal with gene therapy is to supply cells with the missing instructions they need to produce an important protein.
[Over 140,000 readers rely on The Conversation’s newsletters to understand the world. Sign up today.]
A great example of this is cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease caused by mutations in a single gene. Using DNA or an mRNA vaccine, researchers are investigating the feasibility of essentially replacing the missing gene and allowing someone’s body to transiently produce the missing protein. Once the protein is present, the symptoms could disappear, at least temporarily. The mRNA would not persist very long in the human body, nor would it integrate into people’s genomes or change the genome in any way. So additional doses would be needed as the effect wore off.
Research has shown that this concept is feasible, but it still needs some work.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/early-research-suggests-merck-cancer-drug-target-dormant-hiv/,Early research suggests Merck cancer drug may target dormant HIV,"Researchers studying Merck & Co Inc’s cancer drug Keytruda for HIV patients who also have cancer say the immunotherapy may help displace the virus from human immune cells, offering an intriguing area of study for treatment of chronic HIV infection.
Antiretroviral treatments now allow many HIV patients to lead normal lives, but the drugs do not completely remove the virus from the body. Remaining reservoirs of virus mean patients are never truly cured of the infection. Keytruda, also known as pembrolizumab, is a monoclonal antibody designed to help the body’s own immune system fend off cancer by blocking a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1) used by tumors to evade disease-fighting cells.
Such drugs work by releasing molecular brakes, or checkpoints, that tumors use to avoid the body’s immune system, allowing immune cells to recognize and attack cancer cells the same way they fight infections caused by bacteria or viruses.
An international research collaboration said it has found evidence that pembrolizumab can reverse HIV latency – the ability for the virus to “hide” inside cells of people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy.
The study, published on Wednesday, January 26, in Science Translational Medicine, enrolled 32 people with both cancer and HIV through the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. The participants were also being treated with effective antiviral medicines for HIV.
“Pembrolizumab was able to perturb the HIV reservoir,” Professor Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia, said in a statement.
Her group looked at blood samples collected from study participants before and after treatment with pembrolizumab.
Professor Lewin said work would continue on the samples to understand how pembrolizumab modifies the immune response to HIV. She said researchers hope it will “rev up the immune system to kill the HIV infected cells in the way it does with cancer.”",Reuters,"Jan 27, 2022 10:11 AM PHT"

“There is no evidence that the BA.2 variant causes more disease, but it must be more contagious,” Heunicke told a news conference.
The BA.1 lineage currently accounts for 98% of all cases globally but in Denmark has been pushed aside by BA.2, which became the dominant strain in the second week of January.
The UK Health Security Agency has designated BA.2 a variant under investigation, saying it could have a growth advantage.
Preliminary calculations suggest BA.2 could be 1.5 times more infectious than BA.1, Denmark’s top infectious disease authority, Statens Serum Institut (SSI), said in a note on Wednesday.
However, an initial analysis by the institute showed no difference in the risk of hospitalization for BA.2 compared to BA.1.
“There is some indication that it is more contagious, especially for the unvaccinated, but that it can also infect people who have been vaccinated to a greater extent,” SSI’s technical director Tyra Grove Krause said at the briefing.
This could mean the peak of Denmark’s epidemic will extend a bit further into February than previously forecast, Krause said.
BA.2 cases have also been registered in Britain, Sweden and Norway, but to a much lesser extent than in Denmark.

By comparing people’s exposure to air pollution between February and July of 2020 across 47 major cities, scientists concluded that government measures to limit the spread of the virus protected people from deadly pollution.
The peer-reviewed study found that school closures, stay-at-home policies and cancelling events had the strongest impact on levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a noxious gas largely generated by cars.
Domestic and international travel curbs conversely showed little impact on local air pollution.
Nitrogen dioxide is linked to some respiratory and heart conditions and, according to the European Environment Agency (EEA), is responsible for 50,000 premature deaths in the EU every year.
The study said cities in France, Spain and Italy saw NO2 levels fall between 50% and 60% during the period. The authors based their estimate of avoided deaths on observed changes in daily concentrations of pollutants as well as exposure, CAMS said.
The intensity and timing of the reduction in air pollution was studied along with the impact on short-term mortality.
Paris, London, Barcelona, and Milan were among those that avoided the most deaths due to government curbs.
“The effectiveness of certain measures are clear to see,” CAMS director Vincent-Henri Peuch said, calling the findings “extremely significant”.
Professor Antonio Gasparrini from London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), which collaborated on the research, added the information could be used to design better policies to tackle air pollution.
“This ‘natural experiment’ has given us a glimpse of how air quality can be improved by drastic public health measures that would be difficult to implement in normal times,” he said.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/recent-studies-omicron-covid-19/,"Omicron survives longer on plastic, skin than prior variants – study","The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
The Omicron variant can survive longer than earlier versions of the coronavirus on plastic surfaces and human skin, Japanese researchers found in laboratory tests.
Its high “environmental stability” – its ability to remain infectious – might have helped Omicron replace Delta as the dominant variant and spread rapidly, they said. On plastic surfaces, average survival times of the original strain and the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants were 56 hours, 191.3 hours, 156.6 hours, 59.3 hours, and 114.0 hours, respectively. That compared to 193.5 hours for Omicron, the researchers reported on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. On skin samples from cadavers, average virus survival times were 8.6 hours for the original version, 19.6 hours for Alpha, 19.1 hours for Beta, 11.0 hours Gamma, 16.8 hours for Delta and 21.1 hours for Omicron.
On skin, all of the variants were completely inactivated by 15 seconds of exposure to alcohol-based hand sanitizers. “Therefore,” the researchers conclude, “it is highly recommended that current infection control (hand hygiene) practices use disinfectants… as proposed by the World Health Organization.”
Users of rapid antigen tests to detect COVID-19 should swab their nostrils as directed by the manufacturer and not swab the throat or cheek instead, new research shows.
Earlier this month, with Omicron accounting for nearly all coronavirus infections in San Francisco, researchers there performed both PCR and Abbott Laboratories’ BinaxNOW rapid antigen test on 731 people requesting COVID-19 tests. Nasal swabbing “detected over 95% of persons with the highest levels of virus who are most likely contagious,” said Dr. Diane Havlir of the University of California, San Francisco. In 115 volunteers with positive PCR tests, her team compared BinaxNOW results using swab samples from the nose and the throat obtained by trained professionals. Throat swabs detected nearly 40% fewer cases than nose swabs, they reported on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
A separate study from Spain, also posted on medRxiv, found that swabbing the inside of the cheek also is far less reliable than nostril swabbing for detecting infectious virus.
Recent studies had suggested that Omicron is detectable earlier in the throat than in the nose, leading some experts to advise users to swab the throat, although the US Food and Drug Administration maintained the tests should be used as directed.
“These data support using BinaxNOW from nasal swabs as directed on the package,” Havlir said. “Repeat rapid testing is recommended for those with negative BinaxNOW rapid tests and symptoms or an exposure” to an infected person.
Even the highly vulnerable residents of long-term care facilities are generally experiencing less severe disease from Omicron than from earlier versions of the coronavirus, according to new data.
Researchers in England compared hospitalization rates in residents of 333 facilities before and after the Omicron variant became dominant. Among 398 residents infected prior to the emergence of Omicron, 10.8% required hospitalization, compared with 4% of 1,241 infected with Omicron. The average age of infected residents was 85 years. After accounting for other risk factors, the odds of hospitalization were 50% lower for infected patients in the Omicron period, the researchers reported on Sunday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
While most facility residents had been vaccinated and about 10% had been previously infected, the reduction in relative risk of hospitalization between the pre-Omicron and Omicron periods was greatest among Omicron-infected patients who had received vaccine booster doses, at 77%. The researchers have also seen fewer deaths from COVID-19 in the Omicron period, although they said it was too soon to draw firm conclusions about the variant’s effect of mortality.
“Overall,” they conclude, “the markedly decreased severity combined with high vaccination uptake and prior natural infection can be expected to significantly limit the impact of the current wave of Omicron infections on hospitalizations and deaths in residents of long-term care facilities.”",Reuters,"Jan 25, 2022 8:41 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-ceo-sees-annual-covid-19-vaccine-rather-than-frequent-boosters/,Pfizer CEO sees annual COVID-19 vaccine rather than frequent boosters,"JERUSALEM – Pfizer Inc. Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on Saturday, January 22, that an annual coronavirus vaccine would be preferable to more frequent booster shots in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
Pfizer/BioNtech’s COVID-19 vaccine has shown to be effective against severe disease and death caused by the heavily-mutated Omicron variant but less effective in preventing transmission.
With cases soaring, some countries have expanded COVID-19 vaccine booster programs or shortened the gap between shots as governments scramble to shore up protection.
In an interview with Israel’s N12 News, Bourla was asked whether he sees booster shots being administered every four to five months on a regular basis.
“This will not be a good scenario. What I’m hoping [is] that we will have a vaccine that you will have to do once a year,” Bourla said.
“Once a year – it is easier to convince people to do it. It is easier for people to remember,” Boula said. “So from a public health perspective, it is an ideal situation. We are looking to see if we can create a vaccine that covers Omicron and doesn’t forget the other variants and that could be a solution.”
Bourla has said Pfizer could be ready to file for approval for a redesigned vaccine to fight Omicron, and mass produce it, as soon as March.
Citing three studies, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday, January 21, that a third dose of an mRNA vaccine is key to fighting Omicron, providing 90% protection against hospitalization.
A preliminary study published by Israel’s Sheba Medical Center on Monday, January 17, found that a fourth shot increases antibodies to even higher levels than the third but was likely not enough to fend off Omicron. Nonetheless, a second booster was still advised for risk groups, Sheba said.",Reuters,"Jan 23, 2022 10:46 AM PHT"

They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
In very young children, the Omicron variant of the coronavirus causes less severe disease than the Delta variant, according to a new study.
Researchers reviewed data on nearly 80,000 US children under age five with a first infection, including 7,201 infected in late December or early January when Omicron was causing more than 90% of cases.
After accounting for other risk factors, including medical conditions and socioeconomic circumstances, researchers found children infected during the Omicron surge had a 29% lower risk of emergency department visits, a 67% lower risk of hospitalization, a 68% lower risk of needing intensive care, and a 71% lower risk of needing machines to breathe, compared to children infected with Delta.
However, “because of Omicron’s increased transmissibility, the overall number of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilator use in children may still be greater” with Omicron than with Delta, according to a report posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
The investigators have also observed that infection rates were disproportionately higher in Black and Hispanic children for both Omicron and Delta for this age group, and the gap widened for infections with Omicron, said study leader Rong Xu of Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. Not yet published data shows that “children under five had the highest infection rate with Omicron” compared to older children and adults in all age groups, she said.
New findings add to evidence that people with a certain version of a gene are less likely to develop severe COVID-19.
Earlier research had identified a specific group of genes, called the OAS1/2/3 gene cluster, as being involved in the risk for severe COVID-19. One version of a gene in that cluster – passed down from Neanderthals – appeared to protect against severe disease, reducing the risk by about 23%. The earlier research was done mainly in people of European ancestry. According to a report published in Nature Genetics, researchers now see the same association of this genetic variant with less severe COVID-19 in people of African ancestry.
“The fact that individuals of African descent had the same protection allowed us to identify the unique variant in the DNA that actually protects from COVID-19 infection,” coauthor Dr. Jennifer Huffman of said in a statement. OAS genes are involved in a cascade of effects that help cells fight viruses, the researchers said. Understanding of these genes and their effect on COVID-19 risks could aid development of future drugs, they added.
When the Delta variant of the coronavirus was prevalent in the United States, recipients of two doses of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine were less likely to experience a breakthrough infection – and if they did, were slightly less likely to be hospitalized – than recipients of two doses of the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech, a large study found.
Researchers analyzed health records of more than 637,000 vaccine recipients who were not previously infected with the virus and had not gotten a booster shot. As reported on Thursday, January 20, in JAMA, breakthrough infections steadily increased every month from July to November 2021, with higher rates in the Pfizer/BioNTech group.
In November, there were 2.8 cases among every thousand people vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech shots, compared to 1.6 cases per thousand recipients of the Moderna vaccines. The vaccines protected equally well against death, but the hospitalization rate was 12.7% for infected Moderna recipients and 13.3% for Pfizer/BioNTech recipients. When the researchers compared 62,584 Moderna recipients to a closely-matched equal-sized group of Pfizer/BioNTech recipients, the risk for breakthrough infection was 15% lower in the Moderna group.
“Although there is a difference in breakthrough infections, both vaccines are highly protective against SARS-COV-2 infection and especially against the most severe consequences of infection,” said coauthor Pamela Davis of Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in a statement.

Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has seen over 314 million infections and over 5.5 million deaths worldwide.

As a virologist who has followed this pandemic closely, I contend that this vaccine inequity should be of grave concern to everyone.
If the world has learned anything from this pandemic, it’s that viruses do not need a passport. And yet approximately 72% of vaccine doses were administered in high- and upper-middle-income countries – and only 1% in low-income countries. Wealthy countries are giving boosters, and even fourth doses, while first and second doses are not available to many worldwide.

It uses a harmless piece of the spike protein from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 to stimulate and prepare the immune system for future encounters with the virus.
Unlike the three vaccines approved in the US – Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines and Johnson & Johnson’s viral vector vaccine, which provide the body instructions on how to produce the spike protein – CORBEVAX delivers the spike protein to the body directly. Like those other approved COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, CORBEVAX also requires two doses.
CORBEVAX was developed by the co-directors of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine, Maria Elena Bottazzi and Peter Hotez.
During the 2003 SARS outbreak, these researchers created a similar type of vaccine by inserting the genetic information for a portion of the SARS virus spike protein into yeast to produce large amounts of the protein. After isolating the virus spike protein from the yeast and adding an adjuvant, which helps trigger an immune response, the vaccine was ready for use.
The first SARS epidemic was short-lived, and there was little need for Bottazzi and Hotez’s vaccine – until the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in 2019. So they dusted off their vaccine and updated the spike protein to match that of SARS-CoV-2, creating the CORBEVAX vaccine.
A large US-based clinical trial found the vaccine to be safe, well tolerated and over 90% effective at preventing symptomatic infections. The vaccine received emergency use authorization in India, and other developing countries are expected to follow.
Interestingly, the group at Baylor was not able to drum up interest or funding in the US for their vaccine. Instead, newer technologies such as mRNA vaccines raced ahead, even though Bottazzi and Hotez’s vaccine design was more advanced, thanks to their previous work during the 2003 SARS and 2012 MERS outbreaks.
Protein subunit vaccines have an advantage over mRNA vaccines in that they can be readily produced using well-established recombinant DNA technology that is relatively inexpensive and fairly easy to scale up. A similar protein recombinant technology that’s been around for 40 years has been used for the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, which is available for use in 170 countries, and the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine.
This vaccine can be produced at a much larger scale because appropriate manufacturing facilities are already available. Also key to global access is that CORBEVAX can be stored in a regular refrigerator. Therefore, it is possible to produce millions of doses rapidly and distribute them relatively easily. In comparison, producing mRNA vaccines is more expensive and complicated because they are based on newer technologies, rely on highly skilled workers and often require ultralow temperatures for storage and transport.
Another major difference is that the CORBEVAX vaccine was developed with global vaccine access in mind. The goal was to make a low-cost, easy-to-produce and -transport vaccine using a well-tested and safe method. Key to this, the researchers were not concerned with intellectual property or financial benefit. The vaccine was produced without significant public funding; the US$7 million needed for development was provided by philanthropists.
COBREVAX is currently licensed patent-free to Biological E. Limited (BioE), India’s largest vaccine maker, which plans to manufacture at least 100 million doses per month starting in February 2022. This patent-free arrangement means that other low- and middle-income countries can produce and distribute this cheap, stable and relatively easy-to-scale vaccine locally.
Combined, this means that CORBEVAX is one of the cheapest vaccines currently available. How well it works against the omicron variant is under investigation. However, the CORBEVAX story can be used as a model to address vaccine inequity when it is necessary to vaccinate the world population – against COVID-19 and other diseases on the horizon.
There are many reasons global access to vaccines is inequitable. For example, the governments of wealthy nations purchase vaccines in advance, which limits supply. While developing countries do have vaccine production capacity, low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America still need to be able to afford the cost of placing orders.
The Indian government has ordered 300 million doses of CORBEVAX, and BioE plans to produce more than 1 billion shots for people in developing countries. For context, the U.S. and other G7 nations have pledged to donate over 1.3 billion doses of COVID vaccines, yet only 591 million doses have been shipped. These numbers mean that if BioE is able to produce 1.3 billion doses of CORBEVAX as planned, this vaccine will reach more people than those vaccinated by what’s been donated and shipped by the wealthiest nations.

As the Omicron variant has shown, new variants can spread across the world quickly and are much more likely to develop in unvaccinated people and continue to emerge as long as global vaccination rates remain low. It is unlikely that boosters will end this pandemic. Rather, developing globally accessible vaccines like CORBEVAX represent an important first step in vaccinating the world and ending this pandemic. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/who-advisory-panel-recommends-pfizer-vaccine-5-11-year-olds/,WHO recommends reduced dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for under 12s,"The World Health Organization on Friday, January 21,  recommended extending the use of a reduced dosage of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to children aged 5 to 11 years old.
The recommendation comes after the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunisation held a meeting on Wednesday to evaluate the vaccine. It is currently recommended for use in people aged 12 years and above.
The recommended dosage for the younger population is 10 micrograms instead of 30 micrograms offered to those 12 years and older.
“This age group (5-11) is in the lowest priority use group for vaccination except, for children who have co morbidities,” SAGE chairman Alejandro Cravioto said at a briefing.
Pfizer/BioNTech shots have already been authorized for use in the age group in several countries including theUnited States, Canada, Israel, and the European Union.
The WHO’s vaccine director, Kate O’Brien, said no safety concerns were raised for application of Pfizer’s vaccine in 5 to 11 years old in clinical trials.
The panel also recommended that booster doses of Pfizer’s vaccine should be administered 4 months to 6 months after the  completion of the primary series, in high-priority groups like older adults and health workers.
Countries with moderate to high vaccination rates should prioritize available vaccine supply to first achieve high booster dose coverage in higher risk groups before offering vaccine doses to lower risk groups.
“Increase in booster dose coverage for high risk priority groups will usually yield greater reduction in severe disease and deaths than use of equivalent vaccine to increase primary vaccination coverage,” Cravioto added.
Cravioto said the revised roadmap for prioritization for COVID vaccines took into account the increasing availability of vaccines, current coverage and the circulation of variants of concern.
The panel said the recommendation for use of Pfizer’s booster dose was only for certain priority groups and that it was not endorsing “unfettered” use in all ages.
“We simply don’t have evidence yet on the need for or the evidence on the performance of boosters (in children below 12 years of age),” O’Brien said.",Reuters,"Jan 21, 2022 9:48 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/dozens-firms-make-cheap-version-merck-covid-19-pill-poorer-nations/,Dozens of firms to make cheap version of Merck COVID-19 pill for poorer nations,"BRUSSELS, Belgium – Nearly 30 generic drugmakers in Asia, Africa and the Middle East will make cheap versions of Merck & Co’s COVID-19 pill, under a landmark UN-backed deal to give poorer nations wider access to a drug seen as a weapon in fighting the pandemic.
Merck’s early green light to production of its anti-viral pill molnupiravir by other companies during the pandemic is a rare example in the pharmaceutical sector, which usually protects its patented treatments for longer periods.
However, there are questions about molnupiravir which has shown low efficacy in trials and has raised concerns for side-effects, and lengthy procedures for approvals may delay supplies in many poorer nations for months.
Under the deal, negotiated by the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) with Merck, the US company will not receive royalties for the sale of the low-cost version of the pill while the pandemic continues.
The MPP said the deal stipulated the pill would be distributed to 105 less-developed nations.
A molnupiravir course of 40 pills for five days is expected to cost about $20 in poorer nations, an MPP official involved in the talks with drugmakers told Reuters, citing initial estimates from drugmakers, which are subject to change.
That is far below the $700 per course the United States agreed to pay for an initial delivery of 1.7 million courses, but twice as high as first estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO)-backed program to procure COVID-19 drugs and vaccines for the world.
The new agreement allows 27 generic drugmakers from India, China and other countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East to produce ingredients and the finished drug.
An MPP spokesperson said deliveries from some firms covered by the deal could start as early as February. However, that will be subject to regulatory approval.
While molnupiravir is in use in the United States after approval in December, some other Western countries have cancelled or are reconsidering orders after the drug showed low efficacy in trials.
Molnupiravir has also not been approved by the World Health Organization, which makes its sale at the moment not possible in most developing countries with limited regulatory resources for national authorizations.
The drug can already be sold in India, after it received emergency approval by the national regulator, but it is not currently recommended for use because of safety risks.
The developers of molnupiravir, which alongside Merck are US firm Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and Emory University, will not receive royalties for the sale of the low-cost versions made by generic drugmakers while COVID-19 remains classified as a  Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO.
Bangladesh’s Beximco Pharmaceuticals, India’s Natco Pharma, South Africa’s Aspen Pharmacare Holdings and China’s Fosun Pharma are among generics firms that will produce the finished product.
Other companies, including India’s Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, had struck earlier deals with Merck for the production of molnupiravir. Dr Reddy’s will sell molnupiravir at 1,400 rupees ($18.8) per course.
The MPP spokesperson said there was no firm estimate yet of the likely output from generics makers covered by the deal, but that poorer nations’ demand was expected to be largely covered.
The MPP works to increase access to life-saving medicines for poorer countries. It also has an agreement with Pfizer for the sub-licensing of its COVID-19 pill paxlovid to generics drugmakers.",Reuters,"Jan 21, 2022 12:11 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/mild-covid-cases-still-lead-attention-memory-issues/,Mild COVID-19 cases still lead to attention and memory issues – study,"LONDON, United Kingdom – People with mild COVID-19 who do not suffer any other traditional “long COVID” symptoms can still exhibit deteriorated attention and memory six to nine months after infection, a study by Britain’s Oxford University has found.
Cognitive issues impacting concentration levels, along with forgetfulness and fatigue, are features of long COVID – a condition that afflicts some after an initial bout of infection –  but it has not been established how widespread issues with attention span might be following COVID-19 infection.
In the study, participants who had tested positive for COVID-19 previously but did not report other traditional long COVID symptoms were asked to complete exercises to test their memory and cognitive ability.
The researchers found that participants were significantly worse at recalling personal experiences, known as episodic memory, up to six months after infection.
They also had a bigger decline in their ability to sustain attention over time than uninfected individuals up to ninemonths after infection.
“What is surprising is that although our COVID-19 survivors did not feel any more symptomatic at the time of testing, they showed degraded attention and memory,” said Dr Sijia Zhao of the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford.
“Our findings reveal that people can experience some chronic cognitive consequences for months.”
The researchers said that individuals over time demonstrated episodic memory and attention span largely returned to normal after six and nine months, respectively.
Participants also performed well in tests of other cognitive abilities, including working memory and planning, in theanalysis of 136 participants.
Stephen Burgess of the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge highlighted the small number of people involved in the study, adding that it was not randomized.
“However, despite this, differences between the COVID and non-COVID groups in terms of several specific measures of cognitive ability looked at in this study were striking,” he said.
“Despite the limitations of non-randomised research, it seems unlikely that these results can be explained by systematic differences between the groups unrelated to COVID infection.”",Reuters,"Jan 20, 2022 10:11 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/gilead-sciences-counterfeit-versions-hiv-drugs-patients/,Gilead says counterfeit versions of its HIV drugs ended up with patients,"NEW YORK, USA – Gilead Sciences said an unauthorized network of drug distributors and suppliers sold pharmacies more than $250 million of counterfeit versions of its HIV treatments over the last two years, endangering patients.
The drug maker said it found 85,247 bottles that had been tampered with or faked, including versions of its Biktarvy and Descovy treatments.
Gilead said counterfeiters used authentic, but often empty or near-empty, bottles that once contained its HIV medication.
It said the counterfeiters then substituted fake tablets and documentation, and resealed the bottles so they would “resemble” unopened, authentic bottles.
The alleged scheme was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
Gilead disclosed its anti-counterfeiting efforts on the same day a federal judge in Brooklyn unsealed a related civil lawsuit that the Foster City, California-based company filed last July.
The company accused 22 defendants of violating federal trademark and New York consumer protection laws for their roles in the distribution of “dangerous” counterfeits to “unsuspecting patients, placing the patients’ health and lives at risk.”
Gilead said a common counterfeit was an anti-psychotic drug that often causes drowsiness, where tablets were six times more potent than the US Food and Drug Administration recommended for some patients.
It said one patient who unknowingly took that drug after receiving a fake bottle of Biktarvy reported being unable to speak or walk afterward.
The lawsuit seeks, among other remedies, seizures of counterfeit drugs, in addition to court-ordered seizures that have already occurred.
Gilead had warned the public about HIV counterfeits last August 5, two weeks after filing the lawsuit under seal.
Global sales of the company’s HIV treatments totaled $4.19 billion in the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2021, including $2.71 billion of Biktarvy and Descovy.
Lori Mayall, Gilead’s top anti-counterfeiting executive, said the presiding judge in its lawsuit ordered the defendant distributors to stop selling Gilead-branded medications, and the company was unaware of any defendant violating that order.
“We therefore believe that we have successfully stopped any additional counterfeits from these defendants reaching patients,” Mayall said in a statement.",Reuters,"Jan 19, 2022 8:53 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/israeli-study-4th-covid-19-vaccine-shot-less-effective-omicron/,Israeli study shows 4th shot of COVID-19 vaccine less effective on Omicron,"JERUSALEM – A fourth shot of COVID-19 vaccine boosts antibodies to even higher levels than the third jab but it is not enough to prevent Omicron infections, according to a preliminary study in Israel.
Israel’s Sheba Medical Center has given second booster shots in a trial among its staff and is studying the effect of the Pfizer booster in 154 people after two weeks and the Moderna booster in 120 people after one week, said Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the Infectious Diseases Unit.
These were compared to a control group that did not receive the fourth shot. Those in the Moderna group had previously received three shots of Pfizer’s vaccine, the hospital said.
The vaccines led to a increase in the number of antibodies “even a little bit higher than what we had after the third dose”, said Regev-Yochay.
“Yet, this is probably not enough for the Omicron,” she told reporters. “We know by now that the level of antibodies needed to protect and not to get infected from Omicron is probably too high for the vaccine, even if it’s a good vaccine.”
The findings, which the hospital said were the first of its kind in the world, were preliminary and not yet published.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/johnson-johnson-booster-effective-against-omicron-hospitalization-south-africa-study-january-2022/,"J&J booster 85% effective against Omicron hospitalization, South Africa says","JOHANNESBURG, South Africa – A Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine booster shot is 85% effective in protecting against being hospitalized by the Omicron variant for one to two months after it is received, the head of South Africa’s Medical Research Council (SAMRC) said on Friday, January 14.
Glenda Gray presented the findings of a SAMRC study at a South African health ministry briefing on the COVID-19 fourth wave, which has been driven by the new variant.
“We saw an 85% vaccine effectiveness and we saw that this kind of vaccine effectiveness is maintained for up to two months,” she said. “We are very happy to report very high levels of vaccine effectiveness against Omicron.”
The study involved 477,234 healthcare workers, all of them vaccinated with the J&J shot, of whom 236,000 – roughly half – had received the J&J booster shot.
It looked at hospitalizations among those healthcare workers who had been infected during the fourth wave, and found that the booster shot reduced hospitalizations by 63% in the first two weeks after the booster, going up to 85% after that for between one and two months.
“This is the world’s first evidence of vaccine effectiveness [against Omicron] using the J&J vaccine,” Gray said.
The South African authorities have thus far maintained a preference for the Pfizer vaccine – they have administered 21 million doses, three times as many as the roughly 7 million J&J vaccine doses.
But the J&J shot is considered logistically much more preferable because it is a single dose regimen, which is easier to administer in remote rural areas, where follow-ups can be difficult.
The data supported already strong global evidence that Omicron can evade vaccine protection when it comes to the initial infection.
Among the participants in the study, there were about 30,000 breakthrough infections during the Omicron wave, compared with only around 11,000 each in the previous waves driven by the Delta and Beta variants.
The study also highlighted that those infected with HIV were more vulnerable to being hospitalized with Omicron.
“They [those being hospitalized] are more likely to have HIV and less likely to have other comorbidities as compared to the Beta and Delta period,” Gray said.
HIV prevalence in South Africa is about 13%.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/new-data-astrazeneca-booster-generates-higher-antibodies-against-omicron-coronavirus/,New data finds AstraZeneca booster generates higher antibodies against Omicron,"AstraZeneca said on Thursday, January 13, preliminary data from a trial it conducted on its COVID-19 shot, Vaxzevria, showed it generated a higher antibody response against the Omicron variant and others, including Beta, Delta, Alpha and Gamma, when given as a third booster dose.
The increased response was seen in people who were previously vaccinated with either Vaxzevria or an mRNA vaccine, the drugmaker said, adding that it would submit this data to regulators worldwide given the urgent need for boosters.
AstraZeneca has developed the vaccine with researchers from the University of Oxford, and lab studies last month found a three-dose course of Vaxzevria was effective against the rapidly spreading new variant.
The data is the first released by the company from its trials into boosters of its vaccine.
The company said it adds to the growing evidence that supports a third dose of its vaccine irrespective of the primary vaccination schedule.
“These important studies show that a third dose of Vaxzevria after two initial doses of the same vaccine, or after mRNA or inactivated vaccines, strongly boosts immunity against COVID-19,” Oxford Vaccine Group chief Andrew Pollard said in a statement.
A major British trial in December found that AstraZeneca’s shot increased antibodies when given as a booster after initial vaccination with its own shot or Pfizer’s, which is based on mRNA technology.
However, the study concluded that mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna gave the biggest boost to antibodies when given as a booster dose.",Reuters,"Jan 13, 2022 4:46 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/home-remedies-help-ease-symptoms-what-to-eat-when-sick-covid-19/,"Home remedies to ease COVID-19 symptoms, and what to eat when sick","MANILA, Philippines – With the Philippines experiencing an unprecedented surge in COVID-19 cases, Filipinos have begun to report that their local pharmacies are running out of medicines used to treat flu symptoms.
The COVID-19 surge comes alongside the usual flu season, where Filipinos experience symptoms such as cold, cough, body pains, and fever.
While it’s ideal to acquire medicines based on a doctor’s advice and prescription, what should you do when they aren’t available at drugstores?
Fortunately, there are some foods and drinks that may already be in your kitchen that can serve as home remedies to ease COVID-19 symptoms.
The Department of Health (DOH) has also provided guidance on what COVID-19 patients can eat to boost their health and immunity.
While the following foods and drinks may soothe COVID-19 or flu-like symptoms, it is important to note that these are NOT cures for the virus itself.
According to the World Health Organization, there is currently no evidence to support herbal teas, herbal supplements, or probiotics to help prevent or cure COVID-19. The WHO also said ginger and garlic, while having antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, have not shown evidence of being able to prevent COVID-19. Still, these can be helpful to the human body in other ways.
Health authorities around the world still recommend vaccination to protect against COVID-19, along with other preventive measures, like wearing face masks, washing hands, and keeping distance from others.
On Tuesday, January 11, the Philippines recorded 28,007 new COVID-19 cases. This brings to over 3 million the total number of infections since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. The spike is seen to be driven by the highly infectious Omicron variant, which is causing surges all over the world.
Fever is part of the body’s defense against infection, according to Harvard Health Publishing. The DOH advises drinking plenty of water, fresh fruit juice, or mild tea.
Taking a slightly warm shower or bathing regularly, wearing comfortable clothes, and using appropriate blankets while in an adequately ventilated room can also help manage fever. Harvard Health also suggests applying damp washcloths to the forehead and wrists to manage the fever.
Ginger has been cited in some studies to have a pain-lowering effect. However, a 2020 study said that there needs to be further research to create a consensus on the dosage of ginger for long-term therapy.
A 2018 study found that ginger, in addition to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, may contribute to treating migraines. The Brazilian scientists found that ginger treatment “promoted reduction in pain” for emergency room patients.
Lagundi (the type with five leaves) is approved by the Philippine Food and Drug Administration to treat cough and asthma. The DOH advises to boil the leaves, divide the boiled solution into three parts, and drink one part every four hours. Beware of unregistered lagundi products.
Some studies have shown that honey has helped alleviate discomfort in patients with cough. A 2014 study posted by the United States National Institutes of Health on its website found that there is increasing evidence that a single dose of honey may reduce mucus secretion and reduce cough in children.
University of Oxford scientists also said in 2020 that doctors could recommend honey as an alternative to antibiotics. (However, honey should not be given to children under one.)
Melissa Bailey, a clinical dietician at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, said in 2018 that there was scientific evidence backing the consumption of soup when one is sick.
According to Bailey, sodium in some soup recipes helps relieve sore throat pain (the same principle behind gargling warm salt water). Heat from soups can also help clear nasal congestion, and can relieve pain and sinus pressure.
Lugaw, or rice porridge cooked with ginger and chicken, is a local option and known as a comfort healing food in the Philippines.
For sore throat, the DOH advises drinking herbal tea like ginger tea (salabat), gargling lukewarm water with salt, or taking lozenges or cough drops.
Nausea can make eating difficult. The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine advises not to eat or drink until vomiting is controlled. People experiencing nausea can try eating bland food, such as toast, saltine crackers, dry cereal, and oatmeal.
When someone vomits or has diarrhea, the body loses electrolytes like sodium, which are crucial for the body to function.
Some doctors in the US have recommended hydrating with fluids other than water, such as sports drinks like Gatorade. Gatorade has sugar, however, and so a healthier alternative to replenish electrolytes is coconut water.
Rice coffee, which is made from roasted rice, may also help with digestion. According to a blog by Dr. Penelope Domogo, who served as a Mountain Province health officer, the drink may alleviate discomfort from diarrhea, stomach ache, or vomitting.
“Rice coffee has a centering energy and so it stabilizes the expansive energy of yin foods and calms the irritability of the digestive tract. It also absorbs toxins and neutralizes the acid in the stomach and intestines,” Domogo wrote.
The caffeine-free alternative to your usual cup of joe can be prepared by roasting rice until brown or black. Once cool, place the rice in an airtight container. To brew, spoon the roasted rice in a pot or kettle of water (Domogo recommends one tablespoon of rice to one cup) and boil until the water turns brown or black, depending on your desired concentration.
The DOH has issued guidelines on how to feed a COVID-19 patient. Generally, it’s advisable for COVID-19 patients to eat nutritious food, which would contribute to overall health and immunity.
Here are some nutrients the DOH says COVID-19 patients need, and examples of foods and where to get them:
The DOH also recommends adding foods that have known anti-inflammatory effects, like ginger, turmeric, and onions.",Michelle Abad,"Jan 12, 2022 9:00 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/opinion-what-you-should-know-about-radioactivity/,[OPINION] What you should know about radioactivity,"The following is the 22nd in a series of excerpts from Kelvin Rodolfo’s ongoing book project “Tilting at the Monster of Morong: Forays Against the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant and Global Nuclear Energy.“
Here, we look at radioactivity and its forms, because if the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant is activated, they will become serious realities in  our environment. Thankfully, we have to deal with only three forms of radiation: alpha, beta, and gamma. The arithmetic of decay is even simpler, because it involves only alpha and beta radiation.
Let’s illustrate alpha and beta radiation by looking at the first two things that happen when Uranium 238 decays, because it is abundant in uranium-mining and reactor wastes.
Our last foray taught that atomic nuclei, which have only positive charges from their protons, are kept from flying apart by the presence of neutrons. A “Strong Nuclear Force,” 137 times stronger than electromagnetic force but operating only at very close range, bonds the protons and neutrons together.
Some atoms with big nuclei like Uranium 238 are unstable because they have too many protons and too few neutrons to hold them together. They decay by emitting what were named alpha particles when newly discovered but not yet understood. Alpha particles turned out to be whole chunks thrown off the nucleus, each composed of two protons and two neutrons.
An alpha particle is identical to the nucleus of Element #2, Helium. Shortly after an alpha particle emerges from a decaying atom it picks up two electrons from its surroundings and becomes an ordinary atom of helium, a chemically inert and harmless gas.
Hitting you from outside, alpha radiation is harmless, easily stopped by the outer layers of your skin.  However, breathing or swallowing radioactive substances that emit alphas inside you can be dangerous, especially if the altered atom is still radioactive.
After emitting an alpha particle, the “daughter” atom left by its decayed “parent” nucleus now has two fewer protons. Therefore, its atomic number drops by two, and it has become a different element. A decayed U238 atom (Element 92) has become a Thorium atom (Element 90). Having also lost two neutrons, its weight was reduced by four, and so the daughter is the isotope Th234.
But Thorium 234 is also radioactive! Just because a nucleus decays doesn’t mean that the daughter nucleus is stable and won’t decay as well.
Our new Th234 nucleus is also unstable because it now has the opposite problem that U238 had: too few protons and too many neutrons. It decays when one of its neutrons emits a beta particle, now recognized as a high-speed electron, leaving behind a proton, as shown in the picture. The daughter nucleus, now having one more proton, rises in atomic number to 91, Element Protactinium. The lost beta particle didn’t weigh anything, and so the atomic weight remains 234.
We already met beta radiation briefly, as we ended our last foray by learning about Tritium, the radioactive isotope of Hydrogen. Tritium is three times heavier than common hydrogen because its nucleus has two neutrons in addition to its one proton.  The neutrons outnumber the protons so strongly, it is no wonder that tritium is intensely beta-radioactive.
After Chernobyl and Fukushima, people worry about radiation from a reactor accident. But even while operating normally, nuclear power plants abundantly generate and pollute their surroundings with tritium.
Even though tritium is three times heavier than normal hydrogen, it behaves chemically the same way, and so it can substitute for hydrogen in water and food.  If tritium becomes part of your living cells, and then emits beta particles, you can get cancer.
A later foray will closely examine the health hazards posed by normal nuclear-power plant operation. The incidence of bladder cancer in adults living near French NPPs is significantly enhanced. Similarly, Korean research blamed NPPs for higher incidences of thyroid and breast cancers in adults.
Most importantly, many medical studies in the United States, Europe, and Asia have revealed that children are especially vulnerable to be stricken with solid cancers, and especially leukemia. To someone like me who lost a young child to cancer, this is one of the most important reasons for not activating BNPP.
Another important example of beta decay is that of Carbon 14, so useful for dating rocks and archeologic relics. Carbon 12, the overwhelmingly most abundant isotope of carbon, is very stable and never decays because its six protons are comfortably matched by six neutrons. Carbon 14 atoms, much rarer, have two more neutrons and decay by beta emission, becoming atoms of Nitrogen, Element 7.  The older a rock or wooden artifact is, the less C14 remains in it, and so its reduced abundance relative to that of C12 measures its age.
After a decay, the “daughter” nucleus can be left excited with some extra energy that it has to relieve. It does so by emitting a gamma ray, a high-energy light particle. It has neither mass nor electric charge, so neither the atomic number nor atomic weight of the nucleus changes.
Gamma- and X-rays made by modern machines are identical forms of high-frequency radiation. They are very energetic and dislodge electrons from atoms and molecules, ionizing them. Those new ions are unstable and quickly undergo chemical changes. In a fraction of a second, a gamma ray passing through a living body can change the DNA of cells. Prolonged exposure to gamma radiation can lead to cancer.
Marie and Pierre Curie won the Nobel prize in 1898 by discovering Element #88 that Marie named Radium. She also coined the term “radiation.” Very soon after it was discovered, radium was put to good use for medical purposes. Marie did most of the labor in isolating the radium, and prolonged exposure to gamma radiation eventually destroyed her blood and killed her.
When Radium 226 decays it produces another toxic substance, radioactive Radon 222 gas, a major environmental and health concern. If you inhale radon that decays before you exhale, its solid daughter Polonium 218 will remain lodged in your lungs. Only after rapidly undergoing two more alpha and two more beta emissions does the decaying atom finally become a stable metallic atom of Lead. These emissions and accompanying gamma rays damage cells and cause lung cancer.  Radon can also come from radium entering the body with food and drink.
In the continental United States, which is deeply underlain by very ancient rocks containing uranium, radon leaking up into homes is a lung carcinogen, second only to cigarette smoking. Perhaps it is just as well the Philippines are much younger islands without ancient, uranium-rich bedrock, huh?
U238 and Thorium 230 are the most abundant radioactive elements that uranium mining leaves in its waste heaps and ponds. Our next foray will look at how they decay, and the environmental and health hazards they pose in those real-world settings.
We will look in more detail at the complicated series of decays that transforms Uranium 238, by far that element’s most abundant isotope, into common Lead 206 metal.  Using Thorium 230 as our example, we will familiarize ourselves with the strange but exceedingly important idea of a radioactive element’s half-life.
Later, we will also examine the environmental threat of the radioactive waste that BNPP would accumulate, with no way to store permanently out of harm’s way.",Kelvin S. Rodolfo,"Jan 11, 2022 4:40 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/united-states-man-recovering-breakthrough-pig-heart-transplant/,US man recovering after ‘breakthrough’ pig-heart transplant,"CHICAGO, USA – A US man with terminal heart disease was implanted with a genetically modified pig heart in a first-of-its-kind surgery, and three days later the patient is doing well, his doctors reported on Monday, January 10.
The surgery, performed by a team at the University of Maryland Medicine, is among the first to demonstrate the feasibility of a pig-to-human heart transplant, a field made possible by new gene editing tools.
If proven successful, scientists hope pig organs could help alleviate shortages of donor organs.
“This was a breakthrough surgery and brings us one step closer to solving the organ shortage crisis. There are simply not enough donor human hearts available to meet the long list of potential recipients,” Dr. Bartley Griffith, who surgically transplanted the pig heart into the patient, said in a statement.
“We are proceeding cautiously, but we are also optimistic that this first-in-the-world surgery will provide an important new option for patients in the future,” Griffith added.
For 57-year-old David Bennett of Maryland, the heart transplant was his last option.
“It was either die or do this transplant. I want to live. I know it’s a shot in the dark, but it’s my last choice,” Bennett said a day before his surgery, according to a statement released by the university.
To move ahead with the experimental surgery, the university obtained an emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on New Year’s Eve through its compassionate use program.
“The FDA used our data and data on the experimental pig to authorize the transplant in an end-stage heart disease patient who had no other treatment options,” said Dr. Muhammad Mohiuddin, who heads the University’s program on xenotransplantation – transplanting animal organs into humans.
About 110,000 Americans are currently waiting for an organ transplant, and more than 6,000 patients die each year before getting one, according to organdonor.gov.
Bennett’s genetically modified pig heart was provided by Revivicor, a regenerative medicine company based in Blacksburg, Virginia. On the morning of the surgery, the transplant team removed the pig’s heart and placed it into a special device to preserve its function until the surgery.
Pigs have long been a tantalizing source of potential transplants because their organs are so similar to humans. A hog heart at the time of slaughter, for example, is about the size of an adult human heart.
Other organs from pigs being researched for transplantation into humans include kidneys, liver and lungs.
Prior efforts at pig-to-human transplants have failed because of genetic differences that caused organ rejection or viruses that posed an infection risk.
Scientists have tackled that problem by editing away potentially harmful genes.
In the heart implanted in Bennett, three genes previously linked with organ rejection were “knocked out” of the donor pig, and six human genes linked with immune acceptance were inserted into the pig genome.
Researchers also deleted a pig gene to prevent excessive growth of the pig heart tissue.
The work was funded in part with a $15.7 million research grant to evaluate Revivicor’s genetically-modified pig hearts in baboon studies.
In addition to the genetic changes to the pig heart, Bennett received an experimental anti-rejection drug made by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals based in Lexington, Massachusetts.",Reuters,"Jan 11, 2022 1:33 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-south-african-hospital-sees-less-serious-disease-coming-end-omicron-surge/,"COVID-19 science: South African hospital sees less serious disease, coming end of Omicron surge","The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Doctors in one of the cities where Omicron was first identified say the surge driven by the new variant has been marked by less serious disease than earlier waves of the pandemic and there are clear signs that case and hospital admission rates may decline over the next few weeks.
At the Steve Biko Academic Hospital in the City of Tshwane, doctors compared 466 infected patients admitted since mid-November 2021 to 3,976 patients admitted before then. The mortality rate during the Omicron surge was 4.5%, compared to 21.3% in the earlier period, they reported in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. Omicron patients were discharged after an average of 4 days, compared to 8.8 days for patients with earlier variants. At the peak of the Omicron surge, the number of beds filled with infected patients was half of that in the earlier period, and 63% of Omicron patients were hospitalized for other reasons, with the virus only detected by mandatory tests.
“The Omicron outbreak has spread and declined… with unprecedented speed, peaking within four weeks,” the researchers said. They noted that outcomes may vary in countries with different population characteristics and levels of immunity from infection and vaccination. But if the pattern seen in South Africa “continues and is repeated globally….Omicron may be a harbinger of the end of the epidemic phase” of the health crisis.
Researchers believe they have discovered an important way to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants that are likely to spread.
Looking at 9-unit strings of molecules called nucleotides – the building blocks of genes – they found that except for Beta, which did not circulate widely outside of South Africa, each new variant has had more unique strings than the variant that immediately preceded it. The original, or wild, version of the virus had 45 unique so-called 9-mers, the researchers reported on Thursday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Alpha had 109 unique 9-mers, Beta 69, Gamma 122 and Delta 181. The currently dominant Omicron variant has 295.
Many of these stretches of altered polynucleotides have nothing to do with the spike the virus uses to break into cells, which suggests researchers should not focus only on the spike protein, said Venky Soundararajan of Massachusetts-based data analytics company nference. The spike is the target of most current COVID-19 vaccines and antibody treatments.
Soundararajan said a variant circulating in France, called IHU, has more distinct 9-mers than Delta but has been unable to out-compete Omicron. Because IHU has not circulated widely outside of France, he said, populations have not acquired immunity to it, and variants that have yet to emerge in other places may find it “useful” to develop some of the same 9-mer mutations. Vaccine manufacturers should pay attention to IHU’s unique nucleotide signatures because there is a good chance they will show up again in future variants, Soundararajan said.

Speaking at a media briefing, director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also repeated his call for greater equity globally in the distribution of and access to vaccines.
Based on the current rate of vaccine rollout, 109 countries will miss the WHO’s target for 70% of the world’s population to be fully vaccinated by July, Tedros added. That aim is seen as helping end the acute phase of the pandemic.
Another variant – labelled as IHU and first registered in September 2021 – is among those being monitored by the WHO but is not circulating widely, said the WHO’s technical lead on COVID-19, Maria van Kerkhove.
There are two other categories of greater significance the WHO uses to track variants: “variant of concern”, which includes Delta and Omicron, and “variant of interest”.

“The second piece of news: We know that a week after administration of a fourth dose, we see a five-fold increase in the number of antibodies in the vaccinated person,” he told reporters.
“This most likely means a significant increase against infection and… hospitalisation and (severe) symptoms,” Bennett said in English.
Israel has played a leading role in studying the effects of COVID-19 vaccines, as the fastest country to roll out two-dose inoculations to a wide population a year ago and one of the first to give third shots as boosters.

“We are seeing more and more studies pointing out that Omicron is infecting the upper part of the body. Unlike the other ones, that could cause severe pneumonia,” WHO Incident Manager Abdi Mahamud told Geneva-based journalists, saying it could be “good news.”
However, he added that Omicron’s high transmissibility means it will become dominant within weeks in many places, posing a threat in countries where a high portion of the population remains unvaccinated.
His remarks on the reduced risks of severe disease chime with other data including a study from South Africa which was one of the first countries where Omicron was detected.
However, Mahamud also sounded a note of caution, calling South Africa an “outlier” since it has a young population among other factors.

The fresh start of a new year is magically equated with a fresh start to life and often imbued with renewed hope that this year things will be better.
As we enter 2022, after two years of living with COVID-19, this hope may be stronger than usual.
The pandemic’s impacts have ranged from deaths and other adverse effects on physical and mental health, to huge changes in employment, income, travel, leisure and the ability to socialize. The effect on individuals has varied considerably, depending on what their life was like beforehand, how much it has affected them personally, and their own resilience.
Based on discussions with colleagues and patients, we may see resolutions driven by loss, guilt and anger, plus a rush on common types of self-improvement resolutions and a greater drive for overall life changes.

How we respond to the shocks of the pandemic depends in part on our resilience: the ability to adapt well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or significant sources of stress. It involves “bouncing back” from difficult experiences, and it can also involve personal growth.
People who have lost loved ones to COVID may respond with New Year’s resolutions, but they may take positive or negative forms.
Positive resolutions might be commitments to honor the deceased in some way, or to live well because your loved one cannot. A pact or vow made with or to a deceased loved one to “live life better” can be a powerful, positive motivator to change bad health habits such as smoking, excessive drinking or gambling, although professional help is advisable to ensure safe and lasting change.

Negative resolutions, often driven by strong feelings of anger and despair, might be vows to seek revenge or punish those who may seem responsible for the death of their relative or friend.
“Revenge resolutions” are not usually helpful adaptations and may spring from a sense of guilt arising from not being able to save their loved one or spend time with them.
People who survived a COVID infection while a loved one did not, in particular, often experience strong feelings of guilt.

Guilt-driven resolutions are driven by powerful emotions. They are likely to be realized in some form throughout the year, when hopefully the driving emotions become less intense by the following year.
Since the virus has posed a major health risk, it would make sense for more people than ever to choose the New Year to resolve to improve their own health.
Quitting smoking is a very common New Year’s resolution, and it seems even more sensible than usual amid a global pandemic of a virus that mainly attacks the respiratory system. However, as many people have found in the past, giving up cigarettes is very difficult and often requires significant planning and help to succeed.
While the pandemic may have made the desire for change stronger, it does not magically make resolutions any easier to achieve. This applies similarly to resolutions to change the use of alcohol or other drugs, which would also benefit from planning and professional help.
Weight loss is another favorite New Year’s resolution. The famous “COVID kilos” will no doubt drive more people than usual to resolve to lose weight in 2022.
Crash diets are common, but are often abandoned by February. Careful eating and an exercise plan accompanying the resolution will make it more likely to succeed.
While COVID is likely to give an extra edge to common resolutions, we are also likely to see a surge in resolutions for overall “lifestyle change”. Many people’s attitudes to work and family have changed dramatically over the past two years, due to travel restrictions, work or study from home, and little socialisation with those outside our immediate families.

This hugely significant alteration in our way of life has caused many people to reconsider their futures.
Many have found great enjoyment in spending time with family and are now rethinking their work–home balance. Discovering that working from home is possible has made many people reconsider their career options moving into 2022.
Some experts anticipate a post-pandemic work exodus, dubbed the “great resignation,” in which millions of people, from frontline workers to senior executives, may resign from their jobs.
According to recent research by Microsoft, more than 40% of the global workforce are considering leaving their employers. This trend is expected to be replicated in different industries in the US, UK, and Europe. In Australia, this trend is not evident, but nonetheless, a New Year’s resolution may be to determine a different type of employment for 2022 and beyond.
COVID-19 has left most of us drained and wary of the future. Many people believed the pandemic would end in 2020, but 2021 brought more infection, lockdowns and restrictions.
In times of trauma, when the future is uncertain, there can be a polarisation of behaviors. Some people adopt a “devil may care, live for now” attitude to life, with greater risk taking. Others take the opposite attitude, and exercise extreme caution and narrow their existence further.
Both groups may well make New Year’s resolutions to fit their approach to life. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/johnson-and-johnson-booster-effective-against-hospitalization-south-african-omicron-era-study/,J&J booster slashes Omicron hospitalizations – South African study,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa – A booster dose of Johnson & Johnson Inc’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine was 84% effective at preventing hospitalization in South African healthcare workers who became infected as the Omicron variant spread, researchers said on Thursday, December 30.
The real-world study, which has not been peer-reviewed, was based on a second dose of the J&J vaccine administered to 69,092 healthcare workers between November 15 and December 20.
An initial course of inoculation has been shown to offer only greatly reduced protection against infection by Omicron, which is spreading quickly through many countries after first being identified in late November in southern Africa and Hong Kong.
However, several studies have suggested that a booster dose provides significant protection against severe illness from the variant.
The South African study showed the J&J vaccine’s effectiveness at preventing hospitalization rose from 63% shortly after a booster was administered to 84% 14 days later. Effectiveness reached 85% at one to two months post-boost.
“It reassures us that COVID-19 vaccines continue to be effective for the purpose they were designed, which is to protect people against severe disease and death,” said Linda-Gail Bekker, the study’s co-lead investigator.
“This is yet another piece of evidence that we have not lost that impact even in the face of a very mutated variant.”
Bekker said the jury was “still out” on the issue of further boosters of the J&J shot.
“What we are showing is that two doses really restore full protection, and I don’t think we can extrapolate from this that we are going to need a third or a fourth boost at all.”
Researchers said their analysis had several limitations, including short follow-up times, which averaged eight days for healthcare workers who had received their boost within the previous 13 days, or 32 days for those boosted for 1-2 months earlier, and which could skew overall vaccine effectiveness.
Another South African-based study this month showed that a first round of inoculation with two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine had been less effective in South Africa at keeping people infected with the virus out of hospital since the Omicron variant emerged.",Reuters,"Dec 30, 2021 3:29 PM PHT"

Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have said their three-shot course was able to neutralize the new Omicron variant in a laboratory test.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/south-africa-study-suggests-lower-risk-hospitalization-omicron-versus-delta-coronavirus/,South African study suggests lower risk of hospitalization with Omicron versus Delta,"A South African study suggests reduced risks of hospitalization and severe disease in people infected with the Omicron coronavirus variant versus the Delta one, though the authors say some of that is likely due to high population immunity.
Questions about Omicron’s virulence are at the heart of scientific and political debate in many countries, as governments grapple with how to respond to the spread of the variant while researchers race to understand it.
The new study, which has not been peer-reviewed, sought to assess the severity of disease by comparing data about Omicron infections in October and November with data about Delta infections between April and November, all in South Africa.
The analysis was carried out by a group of scientists from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and major universities including University of the Witwatersrand and University of KwaZulu-Natal.
They used data from four sources: national COVID-19 case data reported to the NICD, public sector laboratories, one large private sector lab and genome data for clinical specimens sent to NICD from private and public diagnostic labs across the country.
The authors found the risk of hospital admission was roughly 80% lower for those infected with Omicron compared with Delta, and that for those in hospital the risk of severe disease was roughly 30% lower.
However, they included several caveats and cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the intrinsic characteristics of Omicron.
“It is difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of high levels of previous population immunity versus intrinsic lower virulence to the observed lower disease severity,” they wrote.
Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia, described the South African study as important and said it was the first properly conducted study to appear in pre-print form on the issue of Omicron versus Delta severity.
But Hunter said its main weakness was that it compared Omicron data from one period with Delta data from an earlier period.
“So even though cases of Omicron were less likely to end up in hospital than cases of Delta, it is not possible to say whether this is due to inherent differences in virulence or whether this is due to higher population immunity in November compared to earlier in the year,” he said.
“To a certain extent this does not matter to the patient who only cares that they won’t get very sick. But it is important to know to enable improved understanding of the likely pressures on health services.”
Results of a major study by Imperial College London released last week showed there was no sign that Omicron was milder than Delta, although data on hospitalizations remains very limited. It has not been peer reviewed and published in a medical journal.",Jodesz Gavilan,"Dec 22, 2021 9:46 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/moderna-booster-dose-covid-19-vaccine-appears-protective-omicron/,Moderna says booster dose of its COVID-19 vaccine appears protective vs Omicron,"Moderna said on Monday, December 20, that a booster dose of its COVID-19 vaccine appeared to be protective against the fast-spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus in laboratory testing and that the current version of the shot would continue to be its “first line of defense against Omicron.”
The company said its decision to focus on the current vaccine, mRNA-1273, was driven in part by how quickly the recently-discovered variant is spreading.
Moderna said it still plans to develop a vaccine to protect against Omicron specifically and hopes to start clinical trials early next year.
“What we have available right now is 1273,” Dr. Paul Burton, Moderna’s chief medical officer, said in an interview. “It’s highly effective, and it’s extremely safe. I think it will protect people through the coming holiday period and through these winter months, when we’re going to see the most severe pressure of Omicron.”
Moderna’s shares were down more than 4% at $282.26 in afternoon trading.
The company said a two-dose course of its vaccine generated low neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variant, but a 50-microgram booster dose increased neutralizing antibodies against the variant 37 fold. A 100-microgram booster – the same strength as the original shots – drove neutralizing antibodies to more than 80 times pre-boost levels.
Moderna President Stephen Hoge on a conference call said the company currently does not plan to pursue approval for the higher booster dose.
The antibody levels generated by the lower dose shot “are comfortably above” what would signify a risk of breakthrough infections for other variants of concern, Hoge said.
Moderna did not specify whether it believes its two-dose regimen will reduce hospitalizations or deaths from the Omicron variant. Studies by other researchers have shown a “reasonable and robust” T cell response is maintained against the variant, Hoge said, which could suggest protection against severe disease. T cells in the immune system recognize and eliminate virus-infected cells.
The new data, which has not yet been peer reviewed, tested blood from people who had received Moderna’s vaccine against a pseudovirus engineered to resemble the Omicron variant. It is similar to data discussed last week by top US infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci.
It may not be necessary to push antibody levels higher than those generated by the 50-microgram dose for many people, said Hoge. Governments could, however, choose a higher-dose version if they want to confer an enhanced level of protection.
The company said the 100-microgram dose was generally safe and well tolerated, although there was a trend toward slightly more frequent adverse reactions.
US regulators authorized the 50-microgram booster of Moderna’s vaccine in October.
Both the Moderna and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation, particularly in young men. Several studies have suggested that Moderna’s vaccine is likely to cause the heart inflammation at a higher rate than Pfizer’s.

https://www.rappler.com/philippines/eu-regulator-backs-novavax-shot-regions-fifth-covid-19-vaccine/,EU regulator backs Novavax shot as region’s fifth COVID-19 vaccine,"The European Union’s drug regulator on Monday, December 20, approved use of the COVID-19 vaccine from US-based Novavax in people 18 years and older, paving the way for a fifth coronavirus shot in the region as the Omicroncoronavirus variant spreads.
Data from two large studies showed the vaccine has an efficacy of around 90%, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said, adding that there was currently limited data on its efficacy against some variants of concern, including Omicron.
“After a thorough evaluation, EMA’s human medicines committee (CHMP) concluded by consensus that the data on the vaccine were robust and met the EU criteria for efficacy, safety and quality,” the regulator said.
Novavax said it would start shipping vaccines to the EU’s 27 member states in January. Its Nasdaq-listed shares were up about 10% in US pre-market trading, following the EU approval.
COVID-19 infections have broken records in parts of Europe in recent weeks, with governments and researchers scrambling to bolster defenses against the fast-spreading Omicron, prompting renewed curbs ahead of the Christmas holidays.
The endorsement for the two-dose vaccine, branded Nuvaxovid, comes well a head of possible authorization in the United States, where Novavax has had to resolve manufacturing issues and expects to file for approval by the end of the year.
The regulatory process in the EU has taken longer than  expected too. EMA started a real-time rolling review of the data in February.
Novavax and the EU reached a preliminary deal in December 2020 for the supply of the vaccine, but due to regulatory and production issues the final contract for up to 200 million doses was only signed in August.
The shot received its first regulatory green light in Indonesia last month and is awaiting approval in Japan, where itwould be manufactured and distributed by Takeda Pharmaceutical..
Once EMA has endorsed or refused a product, the executive body of the European Union, the European Commission, makes the final decision, which typically matches what EMA has said.
Separately, Novavax said the Commission’s decision was expected “imminently.”
Vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech,, Moderna, AstraZeneca and J&J had already been approved for use in the EU. But faced with surging infections, EMA has been speeding up reviews of other shots and treatments.
Novavax’s protein-based vaccine uses alternative technology to the other four shots, which makes it more interesting to the EU as it has sought to diversify its portfolio of vaccines.
The company has about eight manufacturing locations, including those of the Serum Institute of India (SII), theworld’s biggest vaccine maker.
Production of the shot in India at SII has also been approved by EMA, an EU official told Reuters.
Antigens for the vaccine, the inactivated organisms that trigger an immune response, are made at Novavax’s factory in the Czech Republic.
Earlier this month, Novavax said it could begin manufacturing of a vaccine tailored for Omicron in January, while it tests whether or not its current vaccine works against the variant.
On Friday, the World Health Organization issued an emergency use listing to SII’s version of Novavax’s vaccine.",Reuters,"Dec 20, 2021 10:20 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/omicron-more-likely-reinfect-than-delta-no-milder/,"Omicron more likely to reinfect than Delta, not milder – study","The risk of reinfection with the Omicron coronavirus variant is more than five times higher and it has shown no sign of being milder than Delta, a study showed, as cases soar across Europe and threaten year-end festivities.
The results of the study by Imperial College London were based on UK Health Security Agency and National Health Service data on people who tested positive for COVID-19 in a PCR test in England between November 29 and December 11.
“We find no evidence (for both risk of hospitalization attendance and symptom status) of Omicron having different severity from Delta,” the study said, although it added that data on hospitalizations remains very limited.
“Controlling for vaccine status, age, sex, ethnicity, asymptomatic status, region, and specimen date, Omicron was associated with a 5.4-fold higher risk of reinfection compared with Delta,” the study, which was dated December 16, added.
The protection afforded by past infection against reinfection with Omicron may be as low as 19%, Imperial College (ICL) said in a statement, noting that the study had not yet been peer reviewed.
The researchers found a significantly increased risk of developing a symptomatic Omicron case compared to Delta for those who were two or more weeks past their second vaccine dose, and two or more weeks past their booster dose.
The study involved AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines.
Depending on the estimates used for vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection from the Delta variant, this translates into vaccine effectiveness of between 0% and 20% after two doses, and between 55% and 80% after a booster dose.
“This study provides further evidence of the very substantial extent to which Omicron can evade prior immunity given by both infection or vaccination,” study lead Professor Neil Ferguson said in ICL’s statement.
“This level of immune evasion means that Omicron poses a major, imminent threat to public health.”
But Dr Clive Dix, former Chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, said it was important not to overinterpret the data.
“The conclusions made are based on making assumptions about Omicron where we still don’t have sufficient data,” Dr Dix said. “For example, we have no data on the cellular immune response which is now probably driving effectiveness of vaccines.”
“This is a crucial missing assumption in the modeling.”
Some of the conclusions are different to the data emerging from South Africa, where vaccines are holding up well against severe disease and death at present, he said.
“There is a huge amount of uncertainty in these modeled estimates and we can only be confident about the impact of boosters against Omicron when we have another month of real-world data on hospitalization ICU numbers and deaths,” he said.
An earlier study by Britain’s SIREN looking at reinfection risk in health workers, which was carried out before Omicron emerged, found that a first coronavirus infection offered 85% protection from a second for the following six months.

The Omicron variant has been detected in 77 countries since it was first identified three weeks ago, fueling concerns that its large number of mutations will help it spread faster and evade protection provided by COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.
Earlier this week, German researchers found that COVID-19 therapies developed by Eli Lilly and Regeneron lose most of their effectiveness when exposed in laboratory tests to the Omicron.
Late last month, Regeneron itself said that lab tests and computer modeling suggested its antibody drug, REGEN-COV, would have reduced efficacy against Omicron.
The drugmaker said though REGEN-COV showed diminished potency against Omicron, it is still active against Delta, which currently is the most prevalent variant in the United States.
REGEN-COV is currently authorized in the US to treat people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and for prevention ofinfection in those exposed to infected individuals, and others at high risk of exposure in settings such as nursing homes or prisons.

The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will be presented new data that appears to show the rate of clots in people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has increased since April, the Post reported, citing clinicians familiar with the agenda.
Use of the vaccine in the United States was paused for 10 days in April to investigate extremely rare but potentially deadly clots, mostly in young and middle-aged women.

The WHO, in its weekly epidemiological update, said that more data was needed to better understand the extent to which Omicron may evade immunity derived from either vaccines or previous infection.
“As a result of this, the overall risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron remains very high,” it said, echoing comments made by WHO officials at an online briefing on Tuesday.
For the first time since the dominant Delta variant was classified as a variant of concern in April, the percentage of Delta sequences registered on the GISAID global science database has declined this week compared with other variants of concern, it said.
This needs to be interpreted with caution as countries may perform targeted sequencing for Omicron and therefore upload fewer sequences on all other variants, including Delta, it said.
The Delta variant is still dominant, however, accounting for 99.2% of the almost 880,000 sequences uploaded to GISAID with specimens collected in the last 60 days.
But the trend is declining in the proportion of Alpha, Beta and Gamma, and with the emergence of Omicron variant. Out of the total, some 3,755 – or 0.4% – were Omicron and the other three variants of concern together numbered 401, less than 0.1% each.",Reuters,"Dec 15, 2021 11:29 PM PHT"

The French and British partners said they expected more results of the late-stage Phase III study of their recombinant adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine candidate in the first quarter.
They plan to file booster data with regulatory authorities following the Phase III results.
“The booster was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to currently approved COVID-19 vaccines. This is the most comprehensive booster trial to date to explore boosting across different vaccine technologies used for primary vaccination,” the companies said in a statement.
“To provide the necessary data to regulatory authorities for the booster vaccine submission, the trial will continue to accrue the number of events needed for analysis, with results expected in Q1, 2022.”
No safety concerns were identified.
The vaccine uses the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines coupled with an adjuvant, a substance that acts as a booster to the shot, made by GSK.
The news provides some optimism for the companies after falling behind rivals in the race for COVID-19 shots and big delays with the development of this shot.
Last year, trials for the shot showed an insufficient immune response in older people. The companies had said the vaccine could be approved by the year-end after initially targeting the first half of the year.
At the end of September, Sanofi dropped its plans for its own mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine because of the dominance achieved by BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna in using the technology to fight the pandemic.
The booster shot has been tested for all age groups and for people who have received four of the most widely approved shots – AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech – as part of their primary vaccine.
It was administered between four and ten months after a complete primary vaccination schedule. The Omicron variant was not circulating during the trial.
“Preliminary results from the VAT0002 clinical trial investigating the safety and immunogenicity of the booster showed neutralizing antibodies increased nine to 43-fold regardless of the primary vaccine received (AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech) and for all age groups tested”, Sanofi said.
The company said this was the most “comprehensive” booster trial to date as European countries grapple with a new wave of COVID-19 infections fueled by the Delta variant of the virus and are gearing up for the new more contagious Omicron variant.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-covid-19-pill-paxlovid-protective-hospitalization-death/,"Pfizer says COVID-19 pill near 90% protective against hospitalization, death","NEW YORK, USA – Pfizer on Tuesday, December 14, said its antiviral COVID-19 pill showed near 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients, and recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against the fast spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
The US drug maker last month said the oral medicine was around 89% effective in preventing hospitalizations or deaths when compared to placebo, based on interim results in around 1,200 people. Data from its final analysis of the trial disclosed on Tuesday includes an additional 1,000 people.
Nobody in the trial who received the Pfizer treatment died, compared with 12 deaths among placebo recipients.
The Pfizer pills are taken with the older antiviral ritonavir every 12 hours for five days beginning shortly after onset of symptoms. If authorized, the treatment will be sold as Paxlovid.
“It’s a stunning outcome,” Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said in an interview.
“We’re talking about a staggering number of lives saved and hospitalizations prevented. And of course, if you deploy this quickly after infection, we are likely to reduce transmission dramatically,” Dolsten said.
Pfizer also released early data from a second study suggesting that the treatment reduced hospitalizations by around 70% in a smaller trial of standard-risk adults, including some higher-risk vaccinated people.
Pfizer said those results showed a positive trend, but were not statistically significant. They are following the results and plan to release data from the final 20% of participants in the 1,100-patient trial.
The trial did not show that the drug alleviated symptoms of COVID-19 in that population.
Dolsten said he expects authorization for use in high-risk individuals from the US Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies soon. He does not believe an FDA advisory panel meeting will be needed.
“We’re in very advanced regulatory dialogues with both Europe and the UK, and we have dialogues with most of the major regulatory agencies globally,” Dolsten said.
Pfizer submitted data to the FDA last month, asking for emergency use authorization (EUA) of the drug.
“These are very exciting results,” said Dr. Paul Sax, a professor at Harvard Medical School.
Sax said the FDA should try to accelerate the authorization process as much as possible, noting there are very limited treatment options for high-risk people outside of the hospital.
There are currently no oral antiviral treatments for COVID-9 authorized in the United States.
Analysts on average forecast 2022 revenue of more than $24 billion from the pill, which would more than make up for any decline in vaccine sales after 2021.
Rival Merck & Co has asked for an EUA for its antiviral pill molnupiravir. But that drug only reduced hospitalizations and deaths in its clinical trial of high-risk patients by around 30%.
Some scientists have also raised safety concerns about the potential for birth defects from the Merck drug, as well as worries that it could cause the virus to mutate.
Pfizer’s treatment works differently. It is part of a class of drugs called protease inhibitors currently used to treat HIV, hepatitis C and other viruses.
Recent laboratory testing showed that activity against the protease of the Omicron variant is as “good as basically any SARS-COV-2 variant of concern,” Dolsten said.
The company has said it can have 180,000 treatment courses ready to ship this year and plans to produce at least 80 million more in 2022.
Dolsten said Pfizer is looking to expand that output further as new variants, like the newly-discovered Omicron, could push the need for antivirals substantially higher. Current vaccines appear to be less effective at preventing infection with Omicron.
Pfizer, which makes one of the leading COVID-19 vaccines with German partner BioNTech, has agreed to allow generic manufacturers to supply versions of the drug to 95 low- and middle-income countries through a licensing agreement with international public health group Medicines Patent Pool (MPP). However, Dolsten said that for next year he expects the drug will be mainly produced by Pfizer.
The MPP told Reuters in a statement, that it will be “well into next year” before pills produced by generic manufacturers under its licenses will be ready for use.

The study, published in the Nature Medicine journal, compared the risks of myocarditis, pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmia following a first and second dose of COVID-19 vaccines – from AstraZeneca-Oxford, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna – with coronavirus infections.
The study, led by Oxford University researchers, found an increased risk of myocarditis with first doses of AstraZeneca-Oxford and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines and both doses of Moderna’s shot, but the risk was much higher after a COVID-19 infection.
Conclusions were arrived at by assessing rates of hospitalizations or death from the conditions within 28 days of vaccination or a positive PCR test for individuals 16 years and older and vaccinated between December 1, 2020 and August 24, 2021.
“We estimated between 1 and 10 extra events of myocarditis in 1 million people vaccinated with a first or second dose, but 40 extra cases in 1 million people infected with COVID-19,” Oxford professor and study lead Julia Hippisley-Cox said.
An analysis by age also showed that higher risk of myocarditis associated with mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna was present only in those younger than 40 years of age, researchers said.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-starts-covid-19-vaccinations-for-young-children/,Indonesia starts COVID-19 vaccinations for young children,"JAKARTA, Indonesia – Indonesia started vaccinating elementary school children aged 6-11 against COVID-19 on Tuesday, December 14, becoming one of the few countries in Asia to start mass inoculations for young children.
Vaccinations against the virus for this age group has been a sensitive issue in some countries. Europe has just started vaccinations for younger children, but countries there are pursuing different strategies because lack of data has made winning over parents more difficult.
Children and young people are seen as unwitting transmitters of the virus to high-risk people and experts say inoculating them is a critical step towards taming the pandemic.
Indonesia’s campaign kicked off with 100 children using China’s Sinovac vaccine. They are among 26.5 million targeted for immunization in Indonesia, which was once Asia’s COVID-19 epicenter.
Muhammad Avisena, 11, said the pain of the injection was worth it compared with potential suffering from becoming sick.
“It will hurt more if exposed to COVID-19 because the lungs would be damaged and infected,” he said after his injection.
His mother, Siti Nuriyah Safitri, said the vaccination would help children get back to school faster after nearly two years of disruption.
“I feel bad for the children if the learning system stays this way,” she said.
She added that at her son’s school only 50% of the children attend each day, with those not coming to school doing lessons online.
COVID-19 has infected 4.2 million people and killed more than 143,000 in Indonesia, where about 38% of the 270 million population have been vaccinated.
In Asia, China has already started vaccinating children aged 3 and above, while Cambodia gave its first vaccines  for young children in September. Singapore will soon start vaccinating children aged 5-11.",Reuters,"Dec 14, 2021 11:46 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/study-pfizer-vaccine-protecting-against-hospitalisation-omicron-wave/,"In South Africa Omicron wave, Pfizer vaccine less effective against hospitalization – study","JOHANNESBURG, South Africa – Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine appear to have given 70% protection against hospitalization in South Africa in recent weeks, according to a major real-world study which suggests weaker efficacy against the new Omicron variant.
The study released on Tuesday, December 14, by South Africa’s largest private health insurance administrator, Discovery Health, was based on more than 211,000 positive COVID-19 test results. Around 78,000 of those results from November 15 to December 7 were attributed to Omicron.
The 78,000 results are not confirmed Omicron cases, meaning the study cannot offer conclusive findings about the variant labeled “of concern” by the World Health Organization and reported in more than 60 countries.
South African scientists have so far confirmed around 550 positive tests as being Omicron, with the variant accounting for 78% of sequences from November, more than the previously dominant Delta variant.
South Africa alerted the world to Omicron late last month, triggering alarm that it could cause another surge in global infections, and leading to the imposition of travel restrictions on southern Africa. South Africa’s daily infections have since risen to around 20,000 in recent days.
The findings from a real-world analysis are some of the earliest on protection against Omicron outside of lab studies, which have shown reduced neutralizing activity against the variant.
Based on analysis by Discovery’s clinical research and actuarial teams, and in collaboration with the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC), the study calculated that two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech offered 70% protection against hospitalization compared with the unvaccinated during the recent surge in cases and 33% protection against infection.
It said this represents a drop from 80% protection against infection and compares with 93% efficacy against hospital admission during South Africa’s outbreak of the Delta variant, which is the globally dominant variant and considered to be the most infectious to emerge during the pandemic.
Discovery cautioned that the study’s findings should be considered preliminary.
Glenda Gray, SAMRC president, said it was however encouraging that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appeared to be offering good protection against severe disease and hospitalization.
South Africa is using the Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson vaccines in its COVID-19 immunization campaign, with more than 20 million Pfizer doses administered so far.
J&J and the SAMRC are conducting a large real-world study of J&J’s vaccine, and recent analysis has shown no deaths from Omicron, Gray said.
“So that’s the good news, it shows again that the vaccine is effective against severe disease and death,” she said.
With 70% or more of the South African population estimated to have been exposed to COVID-19 over the past 18 months, high estimated levels of antibodies in the population might be skewing the data.
“This could be a confounding factor for these hospital admission and severity indicators during this Omicron wave,” Ryan Noach, chief executive of Discovery Health, said in a briefing on the study.
The analysis also shows protection against hospital admission is maintained across all ages, in people from 18 to 79 years, with slightly lower levels of protection for the elderly, it said.
Protection against admission is also consistent across a range of chronic illnesses including diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and other cardiovascular diseases.
It concluded that there was a higher risk of reinfection during the fourth wave than during previous waves and that the risk of hospitalization among adults diagnosed with COVID-19 was 29% lower than during the country’s first wave early last year.
Children appeared to have a 20% higher risk of hospital admission with complications during the fourth wave than during the first, despite a very low absolute incidence, it said.
“This is early data and requires careful follow up,” said Shirley Collie, chief health analytics actuary at Discovery Health.
However, this trend aligns with a warning a recent days from South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) that during the country’s third wave from June to September they had seen an increase in pediatric admissions and now, in the fourth wave, they are seeing a similar increase in admissions for children under five, she said.
South African scientists have said they cannot confirm a link between Omicron and the high admissions of infants, which could be due to other factors.
Considerable uncertainties surround Omicron, first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong, whose mutations may lead to higher transmissibility and more cases of COVID-19 disease.
The WHO has said there were early signs that vaccinated and previously infected people would not build enough antibodies to ward off an Omicron infection, resulting in high transmission rates.
It is unclear whether Omicron is inherently more contagious than the globally dominant Delta variant, the WHO said.

The deal, a second such commitment in Asia Pacific by a western mRNA vaccine developer, underscores efforts by governments around the world to build up local production and prepare for future pandemic threats after limited early access to shots led to slow COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the plant in Victoria state was expected to produce up to 100 million mRNA vaccine doses every year when it begins operations in 2024.
“By advancing with this new partnership, we are building… our sovereign capability to manufacture these vaccines here in Australia,” Morrison told reporters in Melbourne.
Morrison did not specify the financial details of the agreement but Australian media reported the deal could be worth about A$2 billion ($1.43 billion).
Moderna said in October it planned to invest up to $500 million to build a factory in Africa to make up to 500 million doses of mRNA vaccines each year, including its COVID-19 shot.
COVID-19 vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer /BioNTech use mRNA – messenger ribonucleic acid – technology that teaches cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response. The technology can also be used to manufacture vaccines for other respiratory illnesses and seasonal flu.
BioNtech announced a plan in May to set up a new factory in Singapore that will have an estimated annual capacity of several hundred million doses of its mRNA vaccines once it is operational in 2023.
South Korea, which has a deal with Moderna to provide bottling work for the U.S. firm’s COVID-19 vaccine, is also seeking to attract mRNA vaccine makers to start local production.
The announcement by Moderna was made as Australia’s New South Wales state, home to Sydney, reported its biggest daily rise in COVID-19 cases since a nearly four-month lockdown ended in early October.
Despite the surge in new infections, officials said a planned easing of restrictions in Sydney from Wednesday will proceed as they urged people to get their booster shots to ward off the Omicron threat.
Australia has inoculated nearly 90% of its population above 16 with two doses and shortened the wait time for a booster shot after the emergence of the Omicron cases.

The results come a day after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that two shots will not be enough to contain Omicron, following findings from the UK health agency last week that boosters significantly restore protection against the variant.
The Oxford study said that there was no evidence yet that the lower level of infection-fighting antibodies against Omicron could lead to higher risk of severe disease, hospitalization or death in those who have got two doses of approved vaccines.

Considerable uncertainties surround Omicron, first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong, whose mutations may lead to higher transmissibility and more cases of COVID-19 disease, the WHO said in a technical brief issued on Sunday, December 12.
“The overall risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron remains very high for a number of reasons,” it said,reiterating its first assessment of November 29.
It added there were early signs that vaccinated and previously infected people would not build enough antibodies toward off an infection from Omicron, resulting in high transmission rates and “severe consequences.”
It remains unclear for now whether the new lineage is also inherently more contagious than the dominant Delta variant, which would fuel its spread further, WHO warned.
Corroborating the WHO’s assessment, University of Oxford researchers published a lab analysis on Monday, December 13, saying that two two-dose COVID-19 vaccine regimens do not induce enough neutralizing antibodies against Omicron.
While the antibody defenses from courses from AstraZeneca vaccine and BioNTech/Pfizer have been undermined, there is hope that T-cells, the second pillar of an immune response, can at least prevent severe disease by attacking infected human cells.
The Oxford researchers said there was currently no evidence of Omicron causing more severe disease.
Pfizer and BioNTech have said two shots of their vaccine may still protect against severe disease, because its mutations were unlikely to evade the T-cells response.
The WHO cited some preliminary evidence that the number of people getting reinfected with the virus has increased in South Africa.
While early findings from South Africa suggest that Omicron may be less severe than the Delta variant – currently dominant worldwide – and all cases reported in the Europe region have been mild or asymptomatic, it remained unclear to what extent Omicron may be inherently less dangerous, it said.
“More data are needed to understand the severity profile,” it said. “Even if the severity is potentially lower than for the Delta variant, it is expected that hospitalizations will increase as a result of increasing transmission. More hospitalizations can put a burden on health systems and lead to more deaths.”
Further information was expected in coming weeks, it added, noting the time lag between infections and outcomes.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/doctors-weigh-covid-19-impact-children-vaccine-drives-ramp-up/,Doctors weigh COVID-19 impact on children as vaccine drives ramp up,"JERUSALEM – One month after her son Eran had recovered from a mild case of COVID-19, Sara Bittan rushed the three-year-old to the emergency room. He had high fever, a rash, his eyes and lower body were swollen and red, his stomach was hurting and he was crying in pain.
Eventually diagnosed with the rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, or PIMS, Eran was hospitalized in October for a week and has fully recovered, Bittan said.
“It is important for me to tell parents, mothers, all over the world that there is a risk. They should know,” said Bittan. “He suffered a lot and I suffered with him.”
Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors worldwide are learning more about how the illness impacts children.
While cases of severe illness and death remain far more rare among pediatric patients than adults, tens of thousands of children may struggle with its effects. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cites COVID-19 as one of the top-10 causes of death among children age 5 to 11.
A very small portion can suffer badly from complications, such as PIMS, which affects fewer than 0.1% of infected children. “Long COVID” – the persistence of symptoms weeks or months after infection – affects children as well as adults.
A growing number of countries are making COVID-19 vaccines eligible for younger children. The European Union will begin a campaign to inoculate 5- to 11-year-olds next week, while a similar US vaccination drive that began in November appears to be losing momentum.
Doctors hope the knowledge they have gained will not only improve treatment, but also help parents understand the risks of COVID-19 as they consider vaccinating their children.
“Long COVID and PIMS are a major consideration in getting vaccinated,” said Liat Ashkenazi-Hoffnung, who heads the post-coronavirus clinic at Schneider Children’s Medical Center of Israel.
PIMS, which typically occurs a few weeks after coronavirus infection, is caused by the immune system suddenly going into overdrive, creating inflammation in the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, and gastrointestinal organs. Affected children may spend up to two weeks in hospital, some requiring intensive care.
The CDC cited close to 6,000 PIMS cases nationwide, including 52 deaths. It is roughly estimated at 3 cases per 10,000 children, according to Boston Children’s Hospital’s Audrey Dionne, about in line with some European statistics and with the Israeli estimate of one in every 3,500 children infected and a fatality rate of 1%-2%.
Singapore’s Ministry of Health cites six cases of PIMS among more than 8,000 pediatric COVID-19 cases.
Doctors say they have learned how to better treat the condition with most children recovering. UK studies of children six months and one year after PIMS show that most problems had resolved.
“Children from the second wave and now from the third wave (of COVID-19) are benefiting from the information of the first wave,” said Karyn Moshal, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital.
A six-month assessment by Moshal and colleagues published in the Lancet found organ damage to be uncommon in children who were hospitalized with PIMS. Lingering symptoms including mental fatigue and physical weakness often persisted, but resolved with time.
“They get tired more quickly. So schoolwork is affected because they can only concentrate for a shorter period of time,” Moshal said. “Understanding this is important both for the families and for the young people because they can get very disheartened, and also for schools and teachers to understand how to deal with it.”
Several UK and US studies have found that PIMS is more likely to affect Black, Hispanic, and Asian children, although the reasons for that are still unknown.
Identifying long COVID in children presents more of a challenge. Determining its prevalence depends on what symptoms are looked at, and from whom the information is collected – physicians, parents or the children themselves, said Ashkenazi-Hoffnung.
Cautious estimates find about 1% of children with coronavirus will suffer long COVID, said Zachi Grossman, chairman of the Israel Pediatric Association.
Ashkenazi-Hoffnung said her clinic has treated around 200 children for long COVID.
She believes that is likely only the “tip of the iceberg” among previously healthy children and teens, who months after being infected suffer symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, headaches, tremors, and dizziness.
“It can dramatically affect quality of life,” she said.
Simple actions like climbing stairs, running for a bus or simply standing or walking are intolerable, Ashkenazi-Hoffnung said. Some children have developed asthma-like symptoms or hearing loss, and some toddlers who had been walking reverted to crawling because they were so tired and achy.
Most children do recover with time, she said, aided by physiotherapy and medication. Around 20% are still struggling.
Ashkenazi-Hoffnung and Moshal noted an extra burden observed in children who suffered PIMS or long COVID – a sense of stigma and shame.
“I was quite shocked by this,” said Moshal. “You can’t ascribe blame or shame for being infected with a disease.”",Reuters,"Dec 9, 2021 2:07 PM PHT"

In the first official statement from manufacturers on the efficacy of their vaccine against Omicron, they said two doses resulted in significantly lower neutralizing antibodies but a third dose boosted those antibodies by a factor of 25.
The Omicron variant was neutralized in samples of blood taken around a month after the third shot about as effectively as two doses neutralized the original virus identified in China.
“Ensuring as many people as possible are fully vaccinated with the first two dose series and a booster remains the best course of action to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Pfizer boss Albert Bourla said in the statement.
The Omicron variant, first detected in southern Africa last month, has triggered global alarm about another surge in infections. Cases have already been reported from Japan to the United States and across Europe.
The World Health Organization classified Omicron on November 26 as a “variant of concern” but said there was no evidence to support the need for new vaccines specifically designed to tackle the variant and its mutations.
Nevertheless, the companies said they would continue efforts to bring an Omicron-specific COVID-19 vaccine to market. Work had started when the variant first raised concern on November 25.
They said their planned production of 4 billion doses of the Comirnaty vaccine in 2022 was not expected to change if an adapted vaccine was required.
The findings are broadly in line with a preliminary study published by researchers at the Africa Health Research Institute in South Africa on Tuesday, which said Omicron could partially evade protection from two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and suggested a third shot might help fend off infection.
Research on the new variant is still at an early stage. Laboratory analysis at University Hospital Frankfurt in Germany found the ability to mount an antibody response to Omicron in people who had three shots was up to 37 times lower than the response to Delta.
“The companies believe that vaccinated individuals may still be protected against severe forms of the disease,” BioNTech and Pfizer said, although lab data and real-world monitoring had yet to yield new insights.
The vast majority of surface structures on the Omicron spike protein targeted by the T-cells, which typically emerge after vaccination, are not affected by Omicron’s mutations, they said.
T-cells are the second pillar of an immune response, alongside antibodies, and are believed to prevent severe disease by attacking infected human cells.
For their analysis, the two companies used a virus that was bio-engineered to have the hallmark mutations of Omicron, known as a pseudovirus, and blood was collected from subjects three weeks after a second vaccine dose or one month after a third.

Keenan described receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on December 8 2020 as the “best thing that has ever happened”.
“It was wonderful. I cannot believe it now, what happened at the time… I’m so happy I got the jab,” Keenan, known tofriends as Maggie, said in a broadcast clip to mark the anniversary.
“I encourage everyone to have it.”
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has highlighted Britain’s early success in rolling out COVID-19 vaccines and said it is why he was able to reopen England’s economy in July.
He is now urging officials to scale up the country’s ongoing booster program to a similar level as the initial rollout inlight of concern over the new Omicron variant, which has also seen him reintroduce some mask mandates and travel restrictions.
“Vaccines remain our first and best line of defense against the virus,” Johnson said.
Britain has now given nearly 120 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to its population of 67 million, either as first doses, second doses or as boosters.
Scientists are concerned that Omicron might be more transmissible than the currently dominant Delta variant and have mutations associated with lower vaccine effectiveness.
Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said that boosters should continue to offer good protection against severe disease even if shots are less effective against Omicron than previous variants.
May Parsons, the nurse who vaccinated Keenan, said a lot of people now seriously ill in her COVID-19 wards are unvaccinated.
“If you’re unvaccinated, there is still a chance (to get a shot),” Parsons said. “It’s not too late.”",Reuters,"Dec 8, 2021 11:02 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/study-suggests-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-only-partially-protect-against-omicron/,"Early BioNTech, Pfizer data suggests boosters may protect against Omicron infection","BioNTech and Pfizer said on Wednesday, December 8, a three-shot course of their COVID-19 vaccine was able to neutralize the new Omicron variant in a laboratory test, an early signal that booster shots could be key to protection against infection from the newly identified variant.
The German and US companies said two doses of their vaccine resulted in significantly lower neutralizing antibodies but could still be protective against severe disease.
“The first line of defense, with two doses of vaccination, might be compromised and three doses of vaccination are required to restore protection,” BioNTech Chief Medical Officer Ozlem Tuereci said at a press conference.
The companies also said they could deliver an upgraded vaccine targeted specifically at the Omicron variant in March 2022 if one is needed.
BioNTech and Pfizer are the first manufacturers of a COVID vaccine to issue an official update on the efficacy of their shot against Omicron.
In samples of blood taken around a month after the third shot the Omicron variant was neutralized about as effectively as two doses neutralized the original virus identified in China.
The Omicron variant, first detected in southern Africa and Hong Kong last month, has triggered global alarm about another surge in infections. Cases have already been reported from Japan to the United States and across Europe.
“The new data from Pfizer on vaccine effectiveness against Omicron is encouraging,” US President Joe Biden tweeted on Wednesday. “Anyone who is eligible and has not been boosted should go get a booster today.”
BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin suggested that countries might consider shortening the time period between second and third doses of the vaccine to combat the new variant.
He cited recent moves by countries including Britain to bring the third shot forward to three months after the second shot, from six months previously.
“We believe this is the right way to go particularly if the Omicron is now spreading further, to enable a better level of protection in the winter season,” Sahin said.
Dr. Walter Orenstein, a professor at Vanderbilt and former director of the US CDC’s immunization programs, said he found the data encouraging because it suggests that the current vaccines are still usable against the Omicron.
“We may not have to change the vaccine,” he said. “We may be able to get by with the current vaccine, at least for repression of severe disease.”
The World Health Organization classified Omicron on November 26 as a “variant of concern” but said there was no evidence to support the need for new vaccines specifically designed to tackle the variant and its mutations.
Nevertheless, the companies said they would continue efforts to bring an Omicron-specific COVID-19 vaccine to market. Work started on November 25.
They said their planned production of 4 billion doses of the Comirnaty vaccine in 2022 was not expected to change if an adapted vaccine was required. BioNTech said that even if an adapted vaccine was available in March, it would not be broadly available for some time, noting that perhaps 25 to 75 million doses of the new vaccine would be ready at first.
Pfizer scientist Kena Swanson said the company is considering also testing two doses of an Omicron-specific vaccine in currently unvaccinated people.
Pfizer and BioNTech’s findings are broadly in line with a preliminary study published by researchers at the Africa Health Research Institute in South Africa on Tuesday, which said Omicron could partially evade protection from two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and suggested a third shot might help fend off infection.

The data, yet to be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, shows that the companies’ treatment, sotrovimab, is effective against all 37 identified mutations to date in the spike protein, GSK said in a statement.
Last week, another pre-clinical data showed that the drug had worked against key mutations of the Omicron variant. Sotrovimab is designed to latch on to the spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus, but Omicron has been found to have an unusually high number of mutations on that protein.

The novel coronavirus has killed 5.26 million people across the world, according to Johns Hopkins University, wiped out trillions of dollars in economic output and turned life upside down for billions of people.
“The truth is, the next one could be worse. It could be more contagious, or more lethal, or both,” Sarah Gilbert said in the Richard Dimbleby Lecture, the BBC reported. “This will not be the last time a virus threatens our lives and our livelihoods.”
Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford, said the world should make sure it is better prepared for the next virus.
“The advances we have made, and the knowledge we have gained, must not be lost,” she said.
Efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic have been uneven and fragmented, marked by limited access to vaccines in low-income countries while the “healthy and wealthy” in rich countries get boosters, health experts say.
A panel of health experts set up by the World Health Organisation to review the handling of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has called for permanent funding and for greater ability to investigate pandemics through a new treaty.
One proposal was for new financing of at least $10 billion a year for pandemic preparedness.
The COVID-19 outbreak was first detected in China in late 2019. Vaccines were developed against the virus in record time.
Gilbert said the Omicron variant’s spike protein contained mutations known to increase the transmissibility of the virus.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/explainer-omicron-coronavirus-variant-bring-milder-illness/,EXPLAINER: Could the Omicron variant bring milder illness?,"The Omicron variant, spreading now in southern Africa and detected in over 30 other countries, has prompted fears it could significantly undermine the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19.
Yet as scientists race to understand the full consequences of Omicron, some are also asking whether this new version of coronavirus might cause milder illness than its predecessors. While they caution that it is far too early to draw conclusions, here is what is known so far:
Evidence from initial cases of the new variant is limited.
Among 70 cases reported in Europe that included information on disease severity, half of the patients had no symptoms and half had mild symptoms, according to a report on Thursday, December 2, by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
There were no cases of severe disease, hospitalization, or death. However, the European agency said it would require data on hundreds of cases to accurately assess disease complications, estimating that could take several weeks. In addition, most cases detected in Europe so far have been in younger people who were fully vaccinated, making them less likely to suffer severe illness.
In South Africa, where the daily number of reported COVID-19 cases doubled on Wednesday, December 1, to 8,561, symptoms for reinfected patients and those infected after vaccination appear to be mild.
“Some evidence from South Africa suggests that it may actually cause more mild illness but … I caution you that a lot of the patients South Africa initially were among young university students,” Dr. Carlos Del Rio, an infectious diseases expert at Emory University in Atlanta, said on Thursday during an online briefing from the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
While data on real world infections continues to emerge, scientists are conducting laboratory studies to decipher Omicron. The variant has about 50 mutations not seen in combination before, including more than 30 mutations on the spike protein the coronavirus uses to attach to human cells. Vaccines in current use target that spike protein.
“Typically when viruses accumulate a lot of mutations they lose some fitness,” said Dr. John Wherry, director of the Penn Institute for Immunology in Philadelphia. Certain Omicron mutations may impair the ability of the virus to cleave, changing the behavior of the spike protein, he said.
Some scientists have theorized Omicron may have developed over a period of months in an immunocompromised individual, such as an HIV patient in southern Africa. If so, “the virus adapted not to kill that host,” Wherry said.
There are competing theories that the latest variant evolved from an animal host.
The other central question surrounding Omicron is whether it will overtake the Delta variant, which still accounts for the overwhelming majority of known infections worldwide. If Omicron does become dominant, but causes milder illness, it could mark a turning point toward the virus eventually becoming a seasonal threat, like influenza, said Sumit Chanda, an infectious disease researcher at the Scripps Research Department of Immunology and Microbiology in San Diego.
The European Union’s public health agency said on Thursday the Omicron variant could be responsible for more than half of all COVID-19 infections in Europe within a few months.
While the research into Omicron is underway, disease experts say people must remain vigilant against the coronavirus by getting either initial vaccinations or booster shots, as well as wearing masks in indoor or crowded settings, ventilating rooms and washing hands.",Reuters,"Dec 5, 2021 6:10 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/how-can-scientists-update-coronavirus-vaccines-for-omicron/,How can scientists update coronavirus vaccines for Omicron? A microbiologist answers 5 questions about how Moderna and Pfizer could rapidly adjust mRNA vaccines,"If the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is different enough from the original variant, it’s possible that existing vaccines won’t be as effective as they have been. If so, it’s likely that companies will need to update their vaccines to better fight Omicron. Deborah Fuller is a microbiologist who has been studying mRNA and DNA vaccines for over two decades. Here she explains why vaccines might need to be updated and what that process would look like.
Basically, it’s a question of whether a virus has changed enough so that antibodies created by the original vaccine are no longer able to recognize and fend off the new mutated variant.
Coronaviruses use spike proteins to attach to ACE-2 receptors on the surface of human cells and infect them. All mRNA COVID-19 vaccines work by giving instructions in the form of mRNA that direct cells to make a harmless version of the spike protein. This spike protein then induces the human body to produce antibodies. If a person is then ever exposed to the coronavirus, these antibodies bind to the coronavirus’s spike protein and thus interfere with its ability to infect that person’s cells.
The Omicron variant contains a new pattern of mutations to its spike protein. These changes could disrupt the ability of some – but probably not all – of the antibodies induced by the current vaccines to bind to the spike protein. If that happens, the vaccines could be less effective at preventing people from getting infected by and transmitting the Omicron variant.
Existing mRNA vaccines, like those made by Moderna or Pfizer, code for a spike protein from the original strain of coronavirus. In a new or updated vaccine, the mRNA instructions would encode for the Omicron spike protein.
By swapping out the genetic code of original spike protein for the one from this new variant, a new vaccine would induce antibodies that more effectively bind the Omicron virus and prevent it from infecting cells.
People already vaccinated or previously exposed to COVID-19 would likely need only a single booster dose of a new vaccine to be protected not only from the new strain but also other strains that may be still in circulation. If Omicron emerges as the dominant strain over Delta, then those who are unvaccinated would only need to receive two to three doses of the updated vaccine. If Delta and Omicron are both in circulation, people would likely get a combination of the current and updated vaccines.
To make an updated mRNA vaccine, you need two ingredients: the genetic sequence of the spike protein from a new variant of concern, and a DNA template that would be used to build the mRNA.
In most organisms, DNA provides the instructions for making mRNA. Since researchers have already published the genetic code for the Omicron spike protein, all that’s left to do is make a DNA template for the spike protein that would be used to produce the mRNA part of new vaccines.
To do this, researchers mix DNA templates with synthetic enzymes and four molecular building blocks that make mRNA – G, A, U and C for short. The enzymes then build an mRNA copy of the DNA template, a process called transcription. Using this process, it takes only minutes to produce a batch of the mRNA for vaccines. Researchers then place the mRNA transcripts within fatty nanoparticles that protect the instructions until they are safely delivered into cells in your arm.
It takes only three days to generate the DNA template needed to make a new mRNA vaccine. Then it would take about a week to produce sufficient doses of the mRNA vaccine for testing in the lab and another six weeks to perform the pre-clinical tests on human cells in test tubes to make sure a new vaccine works as it should.
So within 52 days, scientists could have an updated mRNA vaccine ready to plug into the manufacturing process and begin producing doses for a human clinical trial. That trial would likely require at least another few weeks for a total of around 100 days to update and test a new vaccine.
While that trial is going on, manufacturers could start switching their current process to making a new vaccine. Ideally, once the clinical trial is complete – and if the vaccine gets authorized or approved – a company could immediately start rolling out doses of a new vaccine.
It’s currently not clear how much clinical data would be required to get FDA approval or authorization for an updated COVID-19 vaccine. However, all the ingredients would be the same in a new vaccine. The only difference would be a few lines of genetic code that would ever so slightly change the shape of the spike protein. From a safety perspective, an updated vaccine is essentially identical to the already tested vaccines. Because of these similarities, clinical testing may not need to be as extensive as what was needed for the first-generation COVID-19 vaccines.
At a minimum, clinical trials for updated vaccines would likely require safety testing and confirmation that an updated vaccine induces antibody levels on par with the response of the original vaccine against the original, Beta, and Delta strains. If these are the only requirements, then researchers would enroll only hundreds – not tens of thousands – of people to obtain the clinical data needed.

One important thing to note is that if vaccine manufacturers decide to update their vaccines for the Omicron variant, it wouldn’t be their first time making this kind of change.
A previous variant, B.1.351, emerged in October 2020 and was sufficiently resistant to then-current vaccines to warrant updating them. Manufacturers quickly responded to the potential threat by developing an updated mRNA vaccine to match this variant and performed clinical trials to test the new vaccine. Fortunately, this variant did not become the dominant variant. But if it had, vaccine manufacturers would have been ready to roll out an updated vaccine.
If it turns out that Omicron – or any future variant, for that matter – warrants a new vaccine, companies have already completed the dress rehearsals and are ready to meet the challenge. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/world-health-organization-top-scientist-says-omicron-could-displace-delta/,WHO’s top scientist says Omicron could displace Delta,"The World Health Organization’s chief scientist told the Reuters Next conference on Friday, December 3, the Omicron variant could become dominant because it is highly transmissible, but that a different vaccine may not be needed.
Soumya Swaminathan also said it was too early to say whether Omicron is milder than other variants of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and cast doubt over its origin, saying it was far from certain it emerged in southern Africa.
“It is possible that it could become (the) dominant variant,” Swaminathan said, adding that it was however impossible to predict. The Delta variant now accounts for 99% of infections globally, she said.
Scientists in the European Union and Australia are forecasting that Omicron may account for more infections than Delta within a few months.
She said Omicron “was highly transmissible” and cited data from South Africa showing the number of cases doubling daily.
“How worried should we be? We need to be prepared and cautious, not panic, because we’re in a different situation to a year ago,” Swaminathan said in an interview.
She said the WHO could not at this stage say that Omicron was a mild variant, even if many infections so far have been associated with less severe symptoms or no symptoms at all.
There is not yet conclusive evidence about Omicron’s impact on the effectiveness of antibodies.
“It does seem to be able to overcome some of the natural immunity from previous infection,” the world health body’s top scientist said, but added that vaccines did seem to be having an effect.
“The fact that they’re not getting sick … that means the vaccines are still providing protection and we would hope that they would continue to provide protection,” Swaminathan said.
Swaminathan was cautious about the need to upgrade existing vaccines, noting that a booster of existing shots might be enough against Omicron.
“It’s possible that the vaccines will work. It’s possible that you may need initially an extra dose to boost immuneresponse,” she said.
A WHO technical advisory group is trying to work out if a new type of vaccine be needed against Omicron, she added.
Speaking to Reuters Next earlier in the day, BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said his company would be able to adapt its vaccine relatively quickly in response to Omicron and the next few weeks would show how urgently an upgrade was needed.
“I believe in principle at a certain timepoint we will need a new vaccine against this new variant,” Sahin said.
Asked about the need for annual vaccine boosters, Swaminathan said “the WHO is preparing for all scenarios”, which could include an additional dose, particularly among some age groups or vulnerable sections of the population.
But she added: “Natural infection acts as a booster.”
Swaminathan, a qualified pediatrician from India, raised doubts about the origin of the new variant, which was first detected in southern Africa, where the highest number of cases is also being recorded.
“Where did it originate? We don’t know,” she said noting it could have originated in countries which do not have enough genomic sequencing.
“We may never know.”
Flight bans by some countries targeting southern Africa were unfair, Swaminathan said, adding that the variant had been identified in South Africa “because of the excellent genomic sequencing and surveillance” there.
“We feel terrible that they have been punished for it.”
The WHO has said travel curbs can buy time but are not the way to fight the Omicron variant, urging countries to boost healthcare capacity and vaccinate their populations.
Swaminathan also urged more equity in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and tests.
Asked whether the Omicron variant may not have emerged if Africa had received and administered more vaccines, she said: “Absolutely.”
“There is a clear relationship between inequity in access to vaccines and the development of variants,” Swaminathan said.",Reuters,"Dec 4, 2021 12:01 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/germany-united-states-agree-new-covid-curbs-omicron-spreads-across-globe/,"Germany, US agree to new COVID curbs as Omicron spreads across globe","Germany decided on Thursday to bar the unvaccinated from all but the most essential businesses and the United States was due to announce further travel curbs as countries around the globe scramble to keep out the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the variant showed the pandemic could be around for “some time,” as countries including the United States, India, and France reported their first cases.
In an interview with Reuters, Yellen said she hoped the pandemic would not completely stifle economic activity, adding that the US stimulus at the start of the pandemic had helped fuel a very strong recovery.
The new measures agreed in Germany focus on the unvaccinated, who will only be allowed in essential businesses such as grocery stores and pharmacies, while legislation to make vaccination mandatory will be drafted for early next year.
“We have understood that the situation is very serious and that we want to take further measures in addition to those already taken,” Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference.
A nationwide vaccination mandate could take effect from February 2022 after it is debated in the Bundestag and after guidance from Germany’s Ethics Council, she said.
Eager to avoid derailing a fragile recovery of Europe’s biggest economy, Germany kept businesses open to the almost 69% of the population that is fully vaccinated as well as those with proof of having recovered from the virus.
Much remains unknown about Omicron, which was first detected in southern Africa last month and has been spotted in at least two dozen countries, just as parts of Europe were already grappling with a wave of infections of the Delta variant.
But the European Union’s public health agency said Omicron could be responsible for more than half of all COVID-19 infections in Europe within a few months, lending weight to preliminary information about its high transmissibility.
In the United States, the Biden administration was expected to announce steps included extending requirements  for travelers to wear masks through mid-March.
By early next week the United States will require inbound international travelers to be tested for COVID-19 within a day of departure, regardless of vaccination status.
It will also require private health insurance companies to reimburse customers for at-home COVID-19 tests, a senior administration official said.
South Africa said it was seeing an increase in COVID-19 reinfections in patients contracting Omicron – with people who have already had the illness getting infected again – in a way that it did not see with other variants.
The first known US case, announced late on Wednesday, was a fully vaccinated person in California who had travelled to South Africa. The two French cases, in the greater Paris region and in eastern France, were passengers arriving respectively from Nigeria and South Africa.
Global shares fell on Thursday, reversing gains from the previous session as a lack of information about Omicron left markets volatile, while crude oil futures extended losses.
Russia has imposed a two-week quarantine for travellers from some African countries including South Africa, the Interfax news agency said, quoting a senior official. Hong Kong extended a travel ban to more countries.
Amid all the new restrictions, Europe’s largest budget airline, Ryanair, said it expected a challenging time at Christmas, although it was still optimistic about summer demand.
In the Netherlands, health authorities called for pre-flight COVID-19 tests for all travel from outside the European Union, after it turned out that most of the passengers who tested positive after arriving on two flights from South Africa on November 26 had been vaccinated.
In France, the country’s top scientific adviser, Jean-Francois Delfraissy, said the “true enemy” for now wasstill the more familiar Delta variant of the virus, spreading in a fifth wave.

Such an agreement to beef up measures to prevent and fight pandemics is expected to be ready in May 2024, covering issues from data sharing and genome sequencing of emerging viruses to potential vaccines and drugs derived from research.
Wednesday’s decision was adopted by consensus at a special ministerial assembly of the 194 nations that are members of the UN health body, drawing applause from delegations at the end of a three-day meeting.
“The text before us is the product of extensive discussions, of frank exchanges and of compromises,” said Australia’s ambassador Sally Mansfield, who cochaired the working group.
“Let us move forward together in solidarity to do the hard work that we have ahead of us.”
The European Union (EU) had pushed for agreement on an international legally binding treaty, along with about 70 countries, but Brazil, India and the United States were among those reluctant to commit to such a pact, diplomats said.
More than 262.22 million people have been reported infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, and 5.46 million killed since it emerged in China in December 2019.
The WHO says China has still not shared some of its early data that might help pinpoint the origin of the virus.
The United States welcomed the decision on the talks for the agreement which it cosponsored.
“This momentous step represents our collective responsibility to work together to advance health security and to make the global health system stronger and more responsive,” its UN mission in Geneva said in a statement on Wednesday.
In parallel to the negotiations on a pandemic instrument, the United States committed to working with other members on “targeted amendments” to the 2005 International Health Regulations, it said.

Cases suggested that the cause of the immune deficiency was sexual. In 1983, a new retrovirus, initially named HLTV-III, was identified as a possible cause. An antibody test was developed; major modes of transmission were identified, and blood supplies screening started. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) first used the term “AIDS,” describing it as “a disease with a defect in cell mediated immunity, occurring in a person with no known cause for diminished resistance.” In 2014, scientists at Oxford University concluded that HIV likely originated in or around Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo decades before it became a pandemic. It is believed that a hybrid form of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) “jumped” from the Pan troglodytes chimpanzee to humans as a result of either blood exposure or ingesting bush meat.
I first heard about this strange illness in 1981, just after medical school. Little did I know that most of my work since then would be related to something so incurable and stigmatizing, that brought with it connotations of immorality, deviant behavior, divine punishment, and death.
In the early years, when this disease was without a name and of unknown cause, it was an “interesting topic” for medical conferences. A few years later, while doing medicals on refugees and migrants in Vietnam, the HIV antibody test became part of the screening procedures, but there were practically none who tested positive. I recall the first few cases detected in Vietnam – around 1990 – in several Thai fishermen who had been caught fishing illegally in Vietnamese waters, subsequently detained and then tested for HIV. Though they were well and had no symptoms, the discovery came as a shock to Vietnamese health authorities.
In 1992, while in the US for graduate studies, more was known about AIDS, its consequences so devastating; people were thrown out of their homes, and many ended up in hospices especially set up for them. I volunteered at one such place near the School of Public Health, run by the Missionaries of Charity, to help care and feed for people, who were merely wasting away waiting for the end. These years were rife with protests by groups like the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), against the government, religious authorities, and big pharma companies, with their famed slogan, “Silence=Death.” The LGBTQ+ rights movement was then gathering momentum. One of the most affecting events I have ever attended was the 1993 March on Washington, and the display of thousands of panels of AIDS quilts on the grounds of the National Mall, the only time in history that all the panels were shown together.
In 1994, I attended one of the weekend HIV workshops of the Library Foundation and did consultancy work with HAIN (Health Action Information Network), visiting projects funded by the American Foundation for AIDS Research in four countries. There followed three pivotal AIDS-focused jobs between 1994 and 2007 – the Philippine HIV & AIDS NGO Support Program, UNDP, and the International AIDS Alliance. I also served on the Board of NGOs working on AIDS. From 2007 until the pandemic onset I was based in Cambodia as a freelance consultant; by 2020 I had worked in 25 countries – writing national strategic and operations plans for HIV, evaluating numerous UN, INGO, and local NGO programs, doing research, training and advising organizations on NGO governance, sexual health, TB, leprosy, LGBTQ+ rights and SOGIE (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression), among other topics.
Meanwhile between 1995 and 2015 major steps towards AIDS prevention and control were achieved: AZT monotherapy gave way to HAART (Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy) in 1996, but this reached the Philippines only years later. No country remained untouched; Africa became a hotbed and AIDS the main cause of death, setting back development gains by decades and decreasing life expectancies. By 1999, AIDS was the number four cause of death worldwide. New drugs and modalities of testing were developed and scaled up, condoms and needle exchange programs proven effective. The Joint UN Program on AIDS, UNAIDS, came into being in 1996, and the Global Fund for AIDS, TB, and Malaria started in 2002. AIDS became the first disease to have its own special session with the UN General Assembly. The UN included HIV in the MDGs in 2015 and in the SDGs for 2030. The French discoverers of the virus won a Nobel prize. Today, millions of people are on ART. Great progress has been made in many countries, new combination drugs have been developed, and the participation of PLHIV and affected communities is acknowledged. Vaccine development has not been successful. Of approximately 75 million cases worldwide, over 30 million have died.
HIV is a topic that no longer has the aura of death. People can safely have children, and and can think more about the future and getting older. Treatment and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is available. I was a godparent to an HIV-positive couple in the mid-1990s, and “Liza,” as she was then known, went on to have a daughter. Yet, tragically, many in the Philippines still live in fear and stigma, not just because of their HIV status but because of the stigma surrounding being gay or transgender. 90-95% of all cases in the Philippines since 2008 have been in gay or bisexual males, and people are getting infected at a younger age. In 2015, HIV surveillance studies showed that in some cities 8.9% (or up to 1 in 11 men who have sex with men) above the age of 25 is HIV-positive.
It is 2021 but in the Philippines, one in six persons is in the late stage by the time they are diagnosed, indicating they have had HIV for several years prior to getting a test. There are low rates of HIV testing and condom use in the most vulnerable and high risk populations, there is still opposition to comprehensive sexuality education, sexual debut is getting younger, and children are having children. Many deaths still go unreported or are labeled as pneumonia, generalized infections, or TB. The Philippine epidemic is still expanding, while in other countries rates are declining.  Since 2017 the country has the dubious title of having the greatest rate of rise of HIV worldwide. If things don’t improve radically, in the next few years, the country will fail to meet the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030, an echo of its failure to reach the 2015 MDGs.

2006 ART is supported through the Global Fund, with 170 people started on treatment at RITM and San Lazaro Hospitals.
2007 The PH epidemic, said to be “low and slow” from the past 20 years, now seems to be “hidden and growing,” as one case a day is reported, double that of 2005.
2008 DOH announces that there are now more reported cases of sexual transmission from homosexual and bisexual males.  Wanggo Gallaga, son of film director Peque Gallaga, goes public. This signals a shift in the face of HIV in the country. Reported cases of HIV increase by 65% over the previous year. Six treatment hubs are funded.
2009 The Philippine epidemic is said to be transitioning from “hidden and growing” to “fast and furious.” Number of cases reported in 2009 has more than doubled compared to 2007.
2010 147 PWID are found to be HIV-positive in Cebu City, a gigantic leap from the eight cases from 1985-2009.  This is 9% of all new HIV cases recorded for the year. For the first time over 1,000 cases a year are reported.

2016 Hairdresser Ricky Reyes is found guilty of AIDS-related discrimination against an employee and pays damages. 9,238 new cases for the year, the highest ever, equivalent to 25.3 new cases a day, or roughly one new case every 57 minutes.
2017 The President signs an executive order calling for universal access to modern family planning methods and the accelerated implementation of the country’s RH law. Research shows that the molecular epidemiology of HIV in the country has shifted since the 1990s-2009, with the “more aggressive” subtype ORF O1-AE more predominant. 11,101 cases for the year (30/day), a record. The country gains the dubious distinction of having the highest rates of rise of HIV worldwide. Philippine domestic funding for HIV now makes up 80% of overall funding for the response.
2018 AIDS Registry starts to differentiate transgender women in its reporting. They comprise 2-3% of all cases recorded since. Homosexual and bisexual males now make up 90-95% of all cases. Republic Act 11166 becomes law. It defines HIV and AIDS education as a right, provides for HIV testing without the need for parental consent for those between 15 to 17; ensures free treatment is provided. 88 ART sites operating, with 33,479 on treatment.
2019 12,728 new cases of HIV in a year (35 new cases each day, one every 41 minutes, another record). A pilot program providing PrEP to 250 gay and other MSM is started. 126 treatment sites in the country with 47,977 on treatment. Despite the big increase, this is merely 42% of all PLHIV in the country.
2020 COVID-19 hits, resulting in lockdowns and large scale disruptions of health services. Fewer testing, diagnoses, and treatment, a reversal of the trends for the past decade. The % of people in later stages of HIV at the time of diagnosis climbs up to 20%, compared to 12% from 2009-2019. Health authorities and NGOs devise innovative ways to counsel, test, and get ART to clients. It is estimated that 68% of PLHIV know status, 42% are on treatment. Only 26% of pregnant women with HIV are on PMTCT.
2021 40 years since the first reports of the disease. By end-September, registered cases hit 90,960, with 54,022 on treatment. There are 33 new infections a day, a 50% increase from 2020, only slightly lower than 35 cases/day in 2019. UNAIDS estimates that the number of HIV cases is 133,000.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/world-health-organization-chief-warns-against-overreaction-to-omicron/,World Health Organization head warns against overreaction to Omicron,"GENEVA, Switzerland –  The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) voiced concern on Tuesday, November 30, that some countries were introducing blanket measures against the Omicron coronavirus variant that may not be necessary and penalized African nations unfairly.
“I well understand the concern of all countries to protect their citizens against a variant that we don’t yet fullyunderstand,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“But I am equally concerned that several Member States are introducing blunt, blanket measures that are not evidence-based or effective on their own, and which will only worsen inequities.”
First reported in southern Africa a week ago, the variant has brought global alarm, led to travel bans, and highlighted the disparity between massive vaccination pushes in rich nations and sparse inoculation in the developing world.
In remarks to a closed-door meeting posted on its website, the WHO’s Ethiopian head urged the 194 member states to stick to “rational, proportional” measures.
There were still more questions than answers, Tedros said, about Omicron’s severity and the effectiveness of vaccines.
No Omicron-linked deaths have yet been reported though the WHO has said it poses a high risk of infection surges.
“Once again, I thank Botswana and South Africa for detecting, sequencing and reporting this variant so rapidly,”added Tedros. “It is deeply concerning to me that those countries are now being penalized by others for doing the right thing.”
Mid-way through a three-day WHO meeting of health ministers, Namibia’s delegation on Tuesday expressed disappointment towards those states imposing travel bans on southern Africa.
“This travel ban is a knee-jerk reaction grounded in politics, not in science or guidance from the WHO Constitution,”it said. “We therefore ask why is it that other states that (detected) the variant in persons who have no travel history to southern Africa are exempted from this travel ban?”
Tanzania called for an immediate lifting of the travel curbs, which are hurting tourism in the region, while Canadavoiced gratitude for regional transparency.
“Transparent international collaboration, as demonstrated by the leadership of South Africa and the South African scientists who swiftly and openly shared information on this new variant, is what is needed now more than ever,” said Leslie Norton, Canada’s U.N. ambassador in Geneva.

The drugmaker said further analyses are ongoing to confirm and quantify this potential impact using the actual Omicron variant sequence.
Regeneron’s shares were down 2.8% at $636 before the bell.
Global markets fell on Tuesday following comments from Moderna Inc’s chief executive officer, who said COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to be as effective against Omicron as they have been previously.
Regeneron said analysis shows the individual mutations present in Omicron indicate “there may be reduced neutralization activity of both vaccine-induced and monoclonal antibody conveyed immunity.”
The analysis included Regeneron’s COVID-19 antibody cocktail REGEN-COV, according to the company.
Rivals Eli Lilly and Co and Vir Biotechnology Inc , who have also developed COVID-19 antibody drugs, did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The World Health Organization and scientists have said it could take weeks to understand whether Omicron is likely to cause severe illness or escape protection against immunity induced by vaccines.

“There is no world, I think, where (the effectiveness) is the same level . . . we had with Delta,” Moderna Chief Executive Stéphane Bancel told the Financial Times in an interview.
“I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like ‘this is not going to be good.'”
Vaccine resistance could lead to more sickness and hospitalizations and prolong the pandemic, and his comments triggered selling in growth-exposed assets like oil, stocks and the Australian dollar.
Bancel added the high number of mutations on the protein spike the virus uses to infect human cells meant it was likely the current crop of vaccines would need to be modified.
He had earlier said on CNBC that it could take months to begin shipping a vaccine that does work against Omicron.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/what-science-says-new-covid-variants-omicron-link-low-vaccine-coverage/,Are new COVID variants like Omicron linked to low vaccine coverage? Here’s what the science says,"The emergence of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, Omicron, has reignited global discussions of vaccine distribution, virus mutation, and immunity against new virus strains.
Some experts have suggested the emergence of a new strain could be a result of low levels of vaccine coverage in developing nations.

A virus is life at its most simple, and essentially contains two main elements: (1) a blueprint for reproduction (made of DNA or RNA), and (2) proteins that let the virus enter cells, take over, and start replicating.
While only a few SARS-CoV-2 viruses are needed to cause an infection, replication of the virus in the lungs is explosive. Millions of virus particles are eventually produced, and some of these viruses are then exhaled to infect another host.
Importantly, the process of duplicating the virus’ RNA is imperfect. Eventually, errors will accumulate in the growing pool of viruses, causing what we refer to as virus variants.

While only a few SARS-CoV-2 viruses are needed to cause an infection, replication of the virus in the lungs is explosive. Millions of virus particles are eventually produced, and some of these viruses are then exhaled to infect another host.
Importantly, the process of duplicating the virus’ RNA is imperfect. Eventually, errors will accumulate in the growing pool of viruses, causing what we refer to as virus variants.
When viruses are transmitted from one person to another, some of the new variants will be better at entering cells or duplicating themselves than others.
In these cases, the “fitter” variants are more likely to take over and become the main virus that replicates within a population.
Over the course of the pandemic, this has occurred several times. The original SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged from Wuhan in 2019 was later replaced by a variant called D614G, followed by the Alpha variant and now, the Delta variant.
Every time someone gets infected with SARS-CoV-2, there is a chance the virus could generate a more fit variant, which could then spread to others.
Our current vaccines are still highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the Delta strain. This is because the vaccines target the whole “spike” protein of the virus, which is a large protein with a relatively small number of changes across variants.
Concerningly, some SARS-CoV-2 variants (Beta, Gamma, Lambda and Mu) have been reported to “evade” immunity from vaccination. This means the immune system is unable to recognise the variant virus as well as the original strain, which reduces the effectiveness of vaccination.
Read more: The Lambda variant: is it more infectious, and can it escape vaccines? A virologist explains
However to date, the global impact of such “immune escape” strains has been limited. For instance, the Beta variant, which showed the highest amount of immune escape, was unable to out-compete Delta in the real world.
For now, any relationship between vaccine coverage and new SARS-CoV-2 variants is unclear.
There are two main factors that could lead to the development of new variants.
First, low vaccine coverage might increase the risk of new variants by allowing transmission within a community.
In this case, high viral replication and person-to-person transmission provides plenty of opportunity for the virus to mutate.
Alternatively, as vaccination rates rise, the only viruses that will be able to successfully infect people will be variants that at least partially escape the protection of vaccines.
This scenario might require continual global surveillance efforts and new vaccines to maintain long-term control of the virus, similar to the flu.
Either way, with COVID-19 almost certain to stick around, we should expect new strains will continue to be a challenge. We will need careful and active management to address this risk.
The recent reports of a new variant of concern, Omicron, has raised global alarm bells.
Discovered by the impressive virus sequencing efforts of South African scientists, Omicron contains an incredible 32 changes in the spike protein alone. This includes mutations that can increase transmission and evade immunity.
So there is a risk that Omicron may spread rapidly and reduce (but not eliminate) the effectiveness of current vaccines.

With low overall vaccination coverage in southern Africa (albeit with higher population level immunity from infection), some have suggested global inequities in the supply of COVID vaccines may be responsible for the emergence of Omicron.
However, the extensive mutations in Omicron are also consistent with the virus changing over an extended time, as it replicated in a person with a compromised immune system.
Such highly mutated variants have been documented in the past but have generally not spread widely.
Expanding global vaccine coverage by increasing supplies, ensuring equitable distribution, and combating hesitancy and misinformation remains critical.
High global vaccine coverage will limit overall viral evolution, protect immunocompromised people and lessen chances highly mutated viruses can spread, all of which can directly or indirectly lower the risks of new variants emerging.
With the global community now highly interconnected, countries will struggle to keep their citizens safe in the face of pandemic threats without embracing a framework for greater international cooperation and coordination. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

The variant’s emergence has triggered a strong global response as countries worried that it could spread fast even in vaccinated populations impose travel curbs and other restrictions.
BioNTech SE said it had started work on a vaccine tailored to Omicron, along with partner Pfizer.
Meanwhile, Moderna Inc said it could take months to begin shipping such a vaccine, Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel told CNBC.
Bancel said the effectiveness of existing COVID-19 vaccines against the variant was currently not known, adding there should be more clarity in about two weeks.
Johnson & Johnson is also evaluating the effectiveness of its COVID-19 vaccine against Omicron, while also pursuing a vaccine specific to the variant.
“We have begun work to design and develop a new vaccine against Omicron and will rapidly progress it into clinical studies if needed,” said Mathai Mammen, global head of research for J&J’s pharmaceuticals unit.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/who-flags-global-risk-from-omicron-countries-tighten-curbs/,WHO flags global risk from Omicron; countries tighten curbs,"The Omicron variant of coronavirus carries a very high global risk of surges, the WHO warned on Monday, November 29, as more countries reported cases, prompting border closures and reviving worries about the economic recovery from a two-year pandemic.
Scientists have said it could take weeks to understand the severity of Omicron, which was first identified in southern Africa. Its emergence has caused a strong global reaction, with countries imposing travel curbs and other restrictions, worried that it could spread fast even in vaccinated populations.
Spooked investors wiped roughly $2 trillion off global stocks on Friday. Financial markets were calmer on Monday, even after Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, said it would close its borders  to foreigners.
The World Health Organization advised its 194 member nations that any surge in infections could have “severe consequences” but said no deaths linked to the Omicron variant had been reported so far.
WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Omicron’s emergence showed how “perilous and precarious” the situation was and called on health ministers meeting in Geneva to pursue a new accord on pandemics.
A top South African infectious disease expert said Omicron appears to be more transmissible than previous variants, including to people with immunity from vaccination or prior infection. South African cases are likely to top 10,000 a day this week, rocketing up from 2,858 on Sunday and barely 300 a day two weeks ago, Professor Salim Abdool Karim said.
But he added that it was too early to say whether symptoms were more severe, and said existing COVID-19 vaccines are probably effective at stopping Omicron from causing severe illness.
On Sunday, a South African doctor who was one of the first to suspect a new strain said Omicron appeared so far to be producing mild symptoms.
Portugal found 13 cases of the variant at a Lisbon football club. Scotland and Austria also reported their first Omicron cases on Monday.
A number of countries have imposed travel restrictions, including Japan, which described its ban on arrivals by foreigners as precautionary.
“These are temporary, exceptional measures that we are taking for safety’s sake, until there is clearer information about the Omicron variant,” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said.
Health Minister Shigeyuki Goto said tests would determine if a traveller from Namibia was Japan’s first Omicron case.
In Israel, a ban on arrivals by foreigners took effect overnight.
US President Joe Biden will provide fresh details of the variant and the US response on Monday, the White House said.
Travel agents in Asia said some travelers were starting to consider cancelling or delaying trips, threatening the global tourism industry’s already fragile recovery.
South Africa has denounced restrictions  on travel from the region, saying it is being punished for its scientific ability to identify variants early.
Scientist Richard Hatchett said Omicron’s emergence had fulfilled predictions that transmission of the virus in low-vaccination areas would speed its evolution. Botswana and South Africa have fully vaccinated less than 25% of their populations.
“The inequity that has characterized the global response has now come home to roost,” Hatchett, who is CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a foundation that funds vaccine development, told the Geneva meeting.
With the WHO urging members to speed up vaccinations of  high-priority groups, the Philippines launched an ambitious drive to inoculate nine million people against COVID-19 in three days, deploying security forces and thousands of volunteers.
“Omicron has an unprecedented number of spike mutations, some of which are concerning for their potential impact on the trajectory of the pandemic,” the WHO said.
Britain, which said it would call an urgent meeting of G7 health ministers on Monday, will unveil new guidance later on giving booster shots to under-40s.
With France also aiming to accelerate its vaccination campaign, President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that he had received a booster shot.
More than 261.17 million people in over 210 countries have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019 and 5,456,515​ have died, according to a Reuters tally.
Markets had been expecting governments and central banks around the world to start withdrawing some of the trillions of dollars meant to keep businesses and households afloat during the pandemic. Another coronavirus wave could mean more support.
Battered stocks and oil prices recovered partly from Friday’s sell-off as markets latched onto hopes that Omicron would prove milder than initially feared.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde sought to reassure investors that the euro zone could cope with a resurgence of the pandemic.
“There is an obvious concern about the economic recovery in 2022, but I believe we have learnt a lot,” she told Italian broadcaster RAI late on Sunday.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/omicron-new-covid-variant-steps-avoid-take-immediately/,"Omicron is the new COVID-19 kid on the block: 5 steps to avoid, 10 to take immediately","South Africa reacted with outrage to travel bans, first triggered by the UK, imposed on it in the wake of the news that its genomics surveillance team had detected a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa has been monitoring changes in SARS-CoV-2 since the pandemic first broke out.
The new variant – identified as B.1.1.529 has been declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organization and assigned the name Omicron.
The mutations identified in Omicron provide theoretical concerns that the variant could be slightly more transmissible than the Delta variant and have reduced sensitivity to antibody activity induced by past infection or vaccines compared to how well the antibody neutralizes ancestry virus.
As vaccines differ in the magnitude of neutralizing antibody induced, the extent to which vaccines are compromised in preventing infections due to Omicron will likely differ, as was the case for the Beta variant.
However, as vaccines also induce a T-cell response against a diverse set of epitopes, which appears to be important for prevention of severe COVID-19, it is likely that they would still provide comparable protection against severe COVID-19 due to Omicron compared with other variants.
The same was observed for the AstraZeneca vaccine. Despite not protecting against the mild-moderate Beta COVID-19 in South Africa, it still showed high levels of protection (80% effective) against hospitalization due to the Beta and Gamma variants in Canada.
In view of the new variant, there are a few steps that governments shouldn’t be taking. And some they should be taking.
Firstly, don’t indiscriminately impose further restrictions, except on indoor gatherings. It was unsuccessful in reducing infections over the past 3 waves in South Africa, considering 60%-80% people were infected by the virus based on sero-surveys and modelling data. At best, the economically damaging restrictions only spread out the period of time over which the infections took place by about 2-3 weeks.
This is unsurprising in the South African context, where ability to adhere to the high levels of restrictions are impractical for the majority of the population and adherence is generally poor.
Secondly, don’t have domestic (or international) travel bans. The virus will disseminate irrespective of this – as has been the case in the past. It’s naive to believe that imposing travel bans on a handful of countries will stop the import of a variant. This virus will disperse across the globe unless you are an island nation that shuts off the rest of the world.
The absence of reporting of the variants from countries that have limited sequencing capacity does not infer absence of the variant. Furthermore, unless travel bans are imposed on all other nations that still allow travel with the “red-listed” countries, the variant will directly or indirectly still end up in countries imposing selective travel bans, albeit perhaps delaying it slightly.
In addition, by the time the ban has been imposed, the variant will likely have already been spread. This is already evident from cases of Omicron being reported from Belgium in a person with no links to contact with someone from Southern Africa, as well as cases in Israel, UK and Germany.
All travel bans accomplish in countries with selective red-listed countries is delay the inevitable. More could possibly be accomplished by rigorous exit and entry screening programs to identify potential cases and mandating vaccination.
Third, don’t announce regulations that are not implementable or enforceable in the local context. And don’t pretend that people adhere to them. This includes banning alcohol sales, whilst being unable to effectively police the black market.
Fourth, don’t delay and create hurdles to boosting high risk individuals. The government should be targeting adults older than 65 with an additional dose of the Pfizer vaccine after they’ve had two shots. The same thing goes for other risk groups such as people with kidney transplants, or people with cancer and on chemotherapy, people with any other sort of underlying immuno-suppressive condition.
South Africa shouldn’t be ignoring World Health Organization’s guidance which recommends booster doses of high risk groups. It should de-prioritize, for the time being, vaccinating young children with a single dose.
Fifth, stop selling the herd immunity concept. It’s not going to materialize and paradoxically undermines vaccine confidence. The first generation vaccines are highly effective in protecting against severe COVID-19, but less predictable in protecting against infection and mild COVID-1`9 due to waning of antibody and ongoing mutations of the virus. Vaccination still reduces transmission modestly, which remains of great value, but is unlikely to lead to “herd-immunity” in our lifetimes.
Instead we should be talking about how to adapt and learn to live with the virus.
There is also a list of things that should be considered in the wake of the Omicron variant, irrespective of whether it displaces the Delta variant (which remains unknown).
Firstly, ensure health care facilities are prepared, not only on paper – but actually resourced with staff, personal protective equipment and oxygen, etc.
There are 2000 interns and community service doctors in South Africa waiting for their 2022 placement confirmation. We cannot once again be found wanting with under-prepared health facilities.
Provide booster doses of J&J or Pfizer to all adults who received a single dose J&J. It’s needed to increase protection against severe COVID-19. A single dose of the J&J vaccine reduced hospitalization due to Delta variant in South Africa by 62% in South African healthcare workers, whereas two doses of AZ and mRNA vaccines in general had greater than 80%-90% protection against severe disease from the [Delta variant](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04120-y (2021).
Studies confirm a two dose schedule of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is superior in protecting against hospitalisation than a single dose. And if you want durability of protection, you need to boost, which can be done with another dose of Johnson & Johnson or a dose of mRNA vaccine.
The evidence is clear that the type of immune responses from a heterologous approach of AZ or JJ followed by a mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer/Biontech induces superior neutralizing and cell mediated immune responses than two doses of the non-replicating vector vaccines.
Thirdly, implement vaccine passports for entry into any indoor space where others gather, including places of worship and public transport. Vaccination might be a choice currently, however, choices come with consequences. Even if vaccines only reduce transmission modestly, over and above the infections they prevent, a breakthrough case in a vaccinated individual poses less risk of transmission to others than infection in an unvaccinated and previously uninfected individual.
Fourth, continue efforts at reaching out to the unvaccinated and under-immunized. This should include the use of pop up facilities where people are likely to gather and other targeted community outreach programs.
Fifth, immediately boost high risk groups older than 65 and others who have immunosuppressive conditions. The primary goal of vaccination therefore needs to be on reducing severe disease and death. This requires targeted strategies on who to prioritize.
Sixth, encourage responsible behavior to avoid re-imposing alcohol and other restrictions to punish all due to irresponsibility on part of a minority.
Seventh, monitor bed availability at regional level to help decide on regional action to avoid overwhelming of facilities. Higher levels of restrictions need to be tailored for when we expect overwhelming of health facilities. As hospitalization usually lag behind community infection rates by 2-3 weeks, keeping an eye on case rates and hospitalization rates could predict which facilities in which regions may come under threat.
This would allow for a more focused approach to imposing restrictions to relieve anticipated pressure on health facilities 2-3 weeks before expected. This will not change the total number of hospitalizations. But it will spread it out over a longer period of time and make it more manageable.
Eighth, learn to live with the virus, and take a holistic view on the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on livelihoods. The detrimental indirect economic, societal, educational, mental health and other health effects of a sledge-hammer approach to dealing with the ongoing pandemic threatens to outstrip the direct effect of COVID-19 in South Africa.
Ninth, follow the science and don’t distort it for political expediency.
Tenth, learn from mistakes of the past, and be bold in the next steps.",,"Nov 28, 2021 2:17 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/explainer-how-worried-should-we-be-about-the-omicron-variant/,EXPLAINER: How worried should we be about the Omicron variant?,"The new Omicron coronavirus variant – identified first in South Africa, but also detected in Europe and Asia – is raising concern worldwide given the number of mutations, which might help it spread or even evade antibodies from prior infection or vaccination.
News of the variant prompted countries to announce new travel restrictions on Friday, November 26, and sent drugmakers scrambling to see if their COVID-19 vaccines remain protective.
The World Health Organization on Friday classified the B.1.1.529 variant, or Omicron, as a SARS-CoV-2 “variant of concern,” saying it may spread more quickly than other forms of coronavirus.
The Delta variant remains dominant worldwide, accounting for 99.9% of US cases, and it is not yet clear whether Omicron will be able to displace Delta, said Dr. Graham Snyder, medical director, infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
But the new variant has over 30 mutations in the part of the virus that current vaccines target. It is also suspected of driving a spike in new infections in South Africa.
Omicron’s mutations are likely to render certain COVID-19 treatments – including some manufactured antibodies – ineffective, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University.
We have all those tools that will work against any variant.
Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California
Experimental antiviral pills – such as Pfizer Inc’s Paxlovid and Merck & Co Inc’s molnupiravir – target parts of the virus that are not changed in Omicron, and these drugs could become even more important if vaccine-induced and natural immunity are threatened.
Scientists say it could be several more weeks before they can define the type of disease caused by the variant, determine how contagious it is and identify how far it has already spread.
Some note that other variants of concern, including Beta, which was also first detected in South Africa, were ultimately replaced by Delta.
But the biggest question remains whether protection from COVID-19 vaccines – nearly 8 billion doses have been administered globally – will hold up. And, will people previously infected with the coronavirus be immune from infection with Omicron?
Experts also don’t yet know whether Omicron will cause more or less severe COVID-19 compared to other coronavirus strains.
Omicron has not yet been identified in the United States, but it is likely already here, scientists said.
Even without the new variant, US COVID-19 rates have increased in recent weeks, mainly in northern states, as people move indoors to avoid winter weather.
Some countries have moved to limit travel from southern Africa. Beyond government restrictions, individuals should still assess their own vulnerability to COVID and tolerance for risk as they make travel decisions for the winter holidays, Snyder from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said.
He and others said vaccination should remain a priority despite questions about effectiveness against Omicron, because it is likely that they still remain protective to a certain extent. Everyone should also continue to wear masks, avoid crowds, ventilate rooms, and wash hands.
“We have all those tools that will work against any variant,” said Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.",Reuters,"Nov 27, 2021 8:53 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/hunt-coronavirus-variants-how-omicron-found-what-we-know-so-far/,The hunt for coronavirus variants: How the new one was found and what we know so far,"Since early in the COVID pandemic, the Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa has been monitoring changes in SARS-CoV-2. This was a valuable tool to understand better how the virus spread. In late 2020, the network detected a new virus lineage, 501Y.V2, which later became known as the Beta variant. Now a new SARS-CoV-2 variant has been identified, known as B.1.1.529. To help us understand more, The Conversation Africa’s Ozayr Patel asked scientists to share what they know.
Hunting for variants requires a concerted effort. South Africa and the UK were the first big countries to implement nationwide genomic surveillance efforts for SARS-CoV-2 as early as April 2020.
Variant hunting, as exciting as that sounds, is performed through whole-genome sequencing of samples that have tested positive for the virus. This process involves checking every sequence obtained for differences compared to what we know is circulating in South Africa and the world. When we see multiple differences, this immediately raises a red flag and we investigate further to confirm what we’ve noticed.
Fortunately, South Africa is well set up for this. This is thanks to a central repository of public sector laboratory results at the National Health Laboratory Service, (NGS-SA), good linkages to private laboratories, the Provincial Health Data Centre of the Western Cape Province, and state-of-the-art modeling expertise.
In addition, South Africa has several laboratories that can grow and study the actual virus and discover how far antibodies, formed in response to vaccination or previous infection, are able to neutralize the new virus. This data will allow us to characterize the new virus.
The Beta variant spread much more efficiently between people compared to the “wild type” or “ancestral” SARS-CoV-2 and caused South Africa’s second pandemic wave. It was therefore classified as a variant of concern. During 2021, yet another variant of concern called Delta spread over much of the world, including South Africa, where it caused a third pandemic wave.
Very recently, routine sequencing by Network for Genomics Surveillance member laboratories detected a new virus lineage, called B.1.1.529, in South Africa. Seventy-seven samples collected in mid-November 2021 in Gauteng province had this virus. It has also been reported in small numbers from neighbouring Botswana and Hong Kong. The Hong Kong case is reportedly a traveller from South Africa.
We do not know for sure. It certainly seems to be more than just the result of concerted efforts to monitor the circulating virus. One theory is that people with highly compromised immune systems, and who experience prolonged active infection because they cannot clear the virus, may be the source of new viral variants.
The assumption is that some degree of “immune pressure” (which means an immune response that is not strong enough to eliminate the virus yet exerts some degree of selective pressure which “forces” the virus to evolve) creates the conditions for new variants to emerge.
Despite an advanced antiretroviral treatment programme for people living with HIV, numerous individuals in South Africa have advanced HIV disease and are not on effective treatment. Several clinical cases have been investigated that support this hypothesis, but much remains to be learnt.
The short answer is, we don’t know. The long answer is, B.1.1.529 carries certain mutations that are concerning. They have not been observed in this combination before, and the spike protein alone has over 30 mutations. This is important, because the spike protein is what makes up most of the vaccines.
We can also say that B.1.1.529 has a genetic profile very different from other circulating variants of interest and concern. It does not seem to be a “daughter of Delta” or “grandson of Beta” but rather represents a new lineage of SARS-CoV-2.
Some of its genetic changes are known from other variants and we know they can affect transmissibility or allow immune evasion, but many are new and have not been studied as yet. While we can make some predictions, we are still studying how far the mutations will influence its behaviour.
We want to know about transmissibility, disease severity, and ability of the virus to “escape” the immune response in vaccinated or recovered people. We are studying this in two ways.
Firstly, careful epidemiological studies seek to find out whether the new lineage shows changes in transmissibility, ability to infect vaccinated or previously infected individuals, and so on.
At the same time, laboratory studies examine the properties of the virus. Its viral growth characteristics are compared with those of other virus variants and it is determined how well the virus can be neutralised by antibodies found in the blood of vaccinated or recovered individuals.
In the end, the full significance of the genetic changes observed in B.1.1.529 will become apparent when the results from all these different types of studies are considered. It is a complex, demanding and expensive undertaking, which will carry on for months, but indispensable to understand the virus better and devise the best strategies to combat it.
There is no evidence for any clinical differences yet. What is known is that cases of B.1.1.529 infection have increased rapidly in Gauteng, where the country’s fourth pandemic wave seems to be commencing. This suggests easy transmissibility, albeit on a background of much relaxed non-pharmaceutical interventions and low number of cases. So we cannot really tell yet whether B.1.1.529 is transmitted more efficiently than the previously prevailing variant of concern, Delta.
COVID-19 is more likely to manifest as severe, often life-threatening disease in the elderly and chronically ill individuals. But the population groups often most exposed first to a new virus are younger, mobile and usually healthy people. If B.1.1.529 spreads further, it will take a while before its effects, in terms of disease severity, can be assessed.
Fortunately, it seems that all diagnostic tests that have been checked so far are able to identify the new virus.
Even better, it appears that some widely used commercial assays show a specific pattern: two of the three target genome sequences are positive but the third one is not. It’s like the new variant consistently ticks two out of three boxes in the existing test. This may serve as a marker for B.1.1.529, meaning we can quickly estimate the proportion of positive cases due to B.1.1.529 infection per day and per area. This is very useful for monitoring the virus’s spread almost in real-time.
Again, we do not know. The known cases include individuals who had been vaccinated. However, we have learned that the immune protection provided by vaccination wanes over time and does not protect as much against infection but rather against severe disease and death. One of the epidemiological analyses that have commenced is looking at how many vaccinated people become infected with B.1.1.529.
The possibility that B.1.1.529 may evade the immune response is disconcerting. The hopeful expectation is that the high seroprevalence rates, people who’ve been infected already, found by several studies would provide a degree of “natural immunity” for at least a period of time.
Ultimately, everything known about B.1.1.529 so far highlights that universal vaccination is still our best bet against severe COVID-19 and, together with non-pharmaceutical interventions, will go a long way towards helping the healthcare system cope during the coming wave. – The Conversation/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/who-names-new-covid-variant-omicron-cautions-against-travel-measures/,"WHO names new COVID variant Omicron, cautions against travel measures","The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday, November 26, classified the B.1.1.529 variant detected in South Africa as a SARS-CoV-2 “variant of concern,” saying it may spread more quickly than other forms.
Preliminary evidence suggested there is an increased risk of reinfection and there had been a “detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology,” it said in a statement after a closed meeting of independent experts who reviewed the data.
Infections in South Africa had risen steeply in recent weeks, coinciding with detection of the variant now designated as Omicron, WHO said.
“This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other (variants of concern),” it said.
Omicron is the fifth variant to carry such a designation.
“This variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage,” the WHO said.
Current PCR tests continue to successfully detect the variant, it said.
Earlier, the WHO cautioned countries against hastily imposing travel restrictions linked to the variant of COVID-19, saying they should take a “risk-based and scientific approach.” Global authorities reacted with alarm to the new variant detected in South Africa, with the EU and Britain among those tightening border controls as scientists sought to find out if the mutation was vaccine-resistant.
“At this point, implementing travel measures is being cautioned against,” WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a UN briefing in Geneva. “The WHO recommends that countries continue to apply a risk-based and scientific approach when implementing travel measures.”
It would take several weeks to determine the variant’s transmissibility and the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutics against it, he said, noting that 100 sequences of the variant have been reported so far.
People should continue to wear masks whenever possible, avoid large gatherings, ventilate rooms and maintain hand hygiene, Lindmeier added.
Mike Ryan, WHO’s emergency director, praised South African public health institutions for picking up the signal of the new variant.
But he warned that while some countries had systems in place to do this, the situation elsewhere was often unclear. “So it’s really important that there are no knee-jerk responses here. Especially with relation to South Africa,” he said. “Because we’ve seen in the past, the minute that there is any mention of any kind of variation, then everyone is closing borders and restricting travel.”",Reuters,"Nov 27, 2021 9:30 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/new-covid-19-variant-triggers-global-alarm-who-urges-caution/,New COVID-19 variant triggers global alarm as WHO urges caution,"Global authorities reacted with alarm on Friday, November 26,  to a new coronavirus variant detected in South Africa, with the EU and Britain among those tightening border controls as researchers sought to find out if the mutation was vaccine-resistant.
Hours after Britain banned flights from South Africa and neighboring countries and asked travelers returning from there to quarantine, the World Health Organization (WHO) cautioned against hasty travel bans.
The head of the UN World Tourism Organization called for a quick decision.
“It depends on WHO recommendations, but my recommendation will be to take decisions today, not after one week, because if it continues to spread as we are expecting then it will be late and will make no sense to apply restrictions,” organization chief Zurab Pololikashvili told Reuters.
One South African scientist expert labelled London’s ban a symptom of “vaccine apartheid”, though European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the EU also aimed to halt air travel from the region and several other countries including India, Japan and Israel toughened curbs.
“It is now important that all of us in Europe act very swiftly, decisively and united,” von der Leyen said. “All air travel to these countries should be suspended until we have a clearer understanding about the danger posed by this new variant.”
In Washington, top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci said no decision had been made on a possible US travel ban. There was no indication that the variant was in the United States, and it was unclear whether it was resistant to current vaccines, he told CNN.
The WHO said it would take weeks to determine how effective vaccines were against the variant, which was first identified this week.
The news pummelled global stocks and oil amid fears about what new bans would do to the global travel industry and already shaky economies across southern Africa.
The variant has a spike protein that is dramatically different to the one in the original coronavirus that vaccines are based on, the UK Health Security Agency said, raising fears about how current vaccines will fare.
“As scientists have described, (this is) the most significant variant they’ve encountered to date,” British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told Sky News.
In Geneva the WHO – whose experts on Friday discussed the risks that the variant, called B.1.1.529, presents – warned against travel curbs for now.
“At this point, implementing travel measures is being cautioned against,” WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told a UN briefing.
It would take several weeks to determine the variant’s transmissibility and the effectiveness of vaccines, Lindmeier said, noting that 100 sequences of it had been reported so far.
British health minister Sajid Javid said the sequence of the variant was first uploaded by Hong Kong from someone traveling from South Africa.
“It is highly likely that it has now spread to other countries,” Javid told lawmakers.
The head of the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium said it was likely the new variant will arrive in Britain.
South African scientists suspect the sudden spike in infections in the country is linked to the new variant, but it is not clear how far it has spread beyond its borders.
Belgium identified Europe’s first case, adding to those in Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong. Denmark has sequenced all COVID-19 cases and found no sign of the new mutation, Danish health authorities said on Thursday.
Israel imposed a travel ban covering most of Africa.
“We are currently on the verge of a state of emergency,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement. “Our main principle is to act fast, strong and now.”
Brazilian health regulator Anvisa recommended that travel be restricted from some African countries, but President Jair Bolsonaro appeared to dismiss such measures.
Bolsonaro has been widely criticized by public health experts for his management of the pandemic, railing against lockdowns and choosing not to get vaccinated. Brazil has the world’s second-highest death toll from the virus, behind only the United States.
One epidemiologist in Hong Kong said it may be too late to tighten travel curbs.
“Most likely this virus is already in other places. And so if we shut the door now, it’s going to be probably too late,” said Ben Cowling of the University of Hong Kong.
European states had already been expanding booster vaccinations and tightening curbs as the continent battles a fourth COVID-19 wave, with many reporting record daily rises in cases.
Discovery of the new variant comes as Europe and the United States enter winter, with more people gathering indoors in the run-up to Christmas, providing a breeding ground for infection.
Italy imposed an entry ban on people who have visited southern African states in the last 14 days, while France suspended flights from southern Africa and Bahrain and Croatia will ban arrivals from some countries.
India issued an advisory to all states to test and screen international travelers from South Africa and other “at risk” countries, while Japan tightened border controls.

The drugmaker released interim data in October showing a roughly 50% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths in 775 patients. The updated rate on Friday is based on data from over 1,400 patients.
Merck’s shares fell 3% to $79.41 in premarket trading, amid a fall in the broader markets.

South African scientists detected a small number of the variant – called B.1.1.529 – on Tuesday, November 23, in samples from November 14-16.
On Wednesday, November 24, South African scientists sequenced more genomes, informed the government that they were concerned and asked the World Health Organization to convene its technical working group on virus evolution for Friday, November 26.
The country has identified around 100 cases of the variant, mostly from its most populated province, Gauteng.
South African scientists say early signs from diagnostic laboratories suggest it has spread rapidly in Gauteng and may already be present in the country’s other eight provinces.
The country’s daily infection rate nearly doubled on Thursday, November 25, to 2,465. The South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) did not attribute the resurgence to the new variant, though local scientists suspect it is the cause.
Botswana detected four cases, all foreigners who arrived on a diplomatic mission and have since left the country.
Hong Kong has one case, in a traveler from South Africa and Israel one in a traveler returning from Malawi.
The variant is relatively easy to distinguish in PCR tests from Delta, the dominant COVID-19 variant and the most infectious so far. Unlike Delta, it has a mutation known as the S-gene drop-out.
All viruses – including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 – change over time. Most changes have little or no impact on their properties.
However, some changes may affect how easily they spread, the their severity or the performance of vaccines against them.
This one has drawn scrutiny because it has more than 30 mutations of the spike protein that viruses use to get into human cells, UK health officials say.
That is about double the number of Delta, and makes this variant substantially different from the original coronavirus that current COVID vaccines were designed to counteract.
South African scientists say some of the mutations are associated with resistance to neutralizing antibodies and enhanced transmissibility, but others are not well understood, so its full significance is not yet clear.
UK Health Security Agency Chief Medical Advisor Dr Susan Hopkins told BBC radio some mutations had not been seen before, so it was not known how they would interact with the other ones, making it the most complex variant seen so far.
So more tests will be needed to confirm if it’s more transmissible, infectious or can evade vaccines.
The work will take a few weeks, the World Health Organization’s technical lead on COVID-19, Maria van Kerkhove, said on Thursday. In the meantime, vaccines remain a critical tool to contain the virus.
No unusual symptoms have been reported following infection with the B.1.1.529 variant and, as with other variants some individuals are asymptomatic, South Africa’s NICD said.
The UN agency will decide if it should be designated a variant of interest or variant of concern. The latter label would be applied if there is evidence that it is more contagious and vaccines work less well against it, and it would be given a Greek name.
The WHO has so far identified four variants “of concern” – Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta.

The UK Health Security Agency said that the variant – called B.1.1.529 – has a spike protein that was dramatically different to the one in the original coronavirus that COVID-19 vaccines are based on.
The variant has also been found in Botswana and Hong Kong, and Britain has banned flights from South Africa and five neighboring countries.
“There are no detected cases of this variant in the UK at this time. But this new variant is of huge international concern,” Javid told lawmakers.
He said the first sequence of the variant was uploaded by Hong Kong from the case of a traveler from South Africa.
“The UK was the first country to identify the potential threat of this new variant and to alert international partners. Further cases have been identified in South Africa and in Botswana, and it is highly likely that it has now spread to other countries.”
Javid paid tribute to South African scientists for their openness and transparency. South Africa has said that Britain’s decision to halt flights from the country seemed rushed.
Javid emphasized that there was much that was not yet known about the variant, but early indications suggested it might render vaccines less effective and be more transmissible, and he was concerned about a surge in cases in South Africa.
“While we don’t know yet definitively whether the exponential growth in South Africa is directly associated with this new variant… one of the lessons of this pandemic has been the we must move quickly and at the earliest possible moment,” Javid said.
Earlier, British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps defended a ban on flights from South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended that Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine, approved for European Union use in teenagers between 12 and 17 years old since May, be given as an injection in the upper arm in two 10 microgram doses, three weeks apart. Adult doses contain 30 micrograms.
The approval comes as Europe is again the epicenter of the pandemic, accounting for about half of cases and deaths.
Inoculating children and young people, who can unwittingly transmit COVID-19 to others, is considered a critical step towards taming the pandemic. In Germany and the Netherlands, kids now account for the majority of cases.
Pfizer and BioNTech have said their vaccine, which is called Comirnaty, showed 90.7% efficacy against the coronavirus in a clinical trial of children aged 5 to 11.
“The benefits of Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 outweigh the risks, particularly in those with conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19,” the EMA said.
While final approval is up to the European Commission, it typically follows EMA recommendations and an EU source told Reuters that a decision would likely come on Friday.
“Today’s recommendation (…) is clear the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine is safe and effective for young children, and can offer them additional protection,” EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides said on Twitter.
Countries will not be able to start rolling out the shots among younger children until next month. The first of the low-dose pediatric version will be delivered on December 20, a spokeswoman for BioNTech said.
Polish Health Ministry spokesman Wojciech Andrusiewicz told state-run news agency PAP that Poland would start vaccinating children aged 5-11 in December when it receives the first batch of 1.1 million doses for the younger kids.
The EU joins a growing number of countries, including the United States, Canada, Israel, China and Saudi Arabia, which have cleared vaccines for children in the 5-11 year age group and younger.
Tens of millions of children in this age group will be eligible for the shot in the EU. Germany will get 2.4 million doses with the first shipment, enough to inoculate about half the country’s children aged 5-11, the BioNTech spokeswoman said.
The Czech Republic’s government said it expects to get 300,000 doses, which would inoculate about a fifth of its younger population.
For pediatric shots, the US regulator authorized a new version of the vaccine, which uses a new buffer and allows them to be stored in refrigerators for up to 10 weeks.
The World Health Organization said on Wednesday that as children and adolescents are at lower risk of severe COVID-19, countries should prioritize adults and sharing doses with the COVAX program aimed at supplying the world’s poorest countries which have struggled to get vaccines.
Surging cases in Europe have prompted new unpopular curbs on movement as winter grips the region and people gather indoors for celebrations in the run-up to Christmas, providing perfect conditions for COVID-19 to spread.
Slovakia started a two-week lockdown on Thursday, following the lead of Austria, while the Portuguese and French governments are considering more restrictions.
While health experts have pushed the wider use of booster shots to try and avoid hospitals being overwhelmed as immunity from earlier shots wanes, vaccinating younger people is another tool in fighting the virus.
Some countries, however, have limited the use of COVID-19 shots based on the so-called mRNA technology used by Pfizer-BioNTech to younger people after reports of possible rare cardiovascular side-effects.
Top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci told Reuters this week there had been no sign of any new safety issues since the rollout of vaccines for younger kids started earlier this month.

Merck’s COVID-19 treatment is not the only one in the game. US peer Pfizer Inc halted early a trial of its antiviral drug Paxlovid after it proved to cut the risk of severe COVID-19 by 89%, outdoing the results seen with Merck’s product.
Pfizer said last week it struck a $5.29 billion deal with the US government to deliver 10 million courses of its experimental COVID-19 pill.
Earlier, the company said it would allow generic manufacturers to supply its pill to 95 low- and middle-income countries through licensing agreements with international public health group Medicines Patent Pool (MPP).
Merck has licensing pacts for its COVID-19 pill in more than 100 countries.
US approval for both experimental pills is still pending.
While Pfizer expects to submit interim trial results for its pill to US Food and Drug Administration before the Thanksgiving holiday on November 25, review of the company’s Paxlovid by European Medicines Agency (EMA) started last Friday.
Merck’s molnupiravir received its first regulatory approval globally in Britain, where it is planned to be marketed under the LAGEVRIO trademark. Although it is still under review in the European Union, faced with rising COVID-19 cases, EMA issued on Friday advice on using Merck’s COVID-19 pill for adults ahead of providing any wider recommendation.

A two-dose series of the vaccine was 100% effective against COVID-19, measured seven days through over four months after the second dose, the company said.
The long-term data will support planned submissions for full-regulatory approval of the vaccine in the age group in the United States and worldwide.
Pfizer and BioNTech will seek clearance for a 30-microgram dose of the vaccine for those aged 12 and above.

The origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 remains a mystery and a major source of tension between China and the United States.
A joint study by China and the World Health Organization (WHO) this year all but ruled out the theory that COVID-19 originated in a laboratory, saying that the most likely hypothesis was that it infected humans naturally, probably via the wildlife trade.
A WHO-led team of experts spent four weeks in and around the central city of Wuhan with Chinese scientists and said in a joint report in March that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had probably been transmitted from bats to humans through another animal but that further research was needed.
The accountant, who was widely thought to be the first person with COVID-19, reported that his first symptoms appeared on December 16, several days later than initially known, Michael Worobey, head of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, said in the study published in the journal Science on Thursday, November 18.
The confusion was caused by a dental problem he had on December 8.
“His symptom onset came after multiple cases in workers at Huanan Market, making a female seafood vendor there the earliest known case, with illness onset 11 December,” the study said.
It said most early symptomatic cases were linked to the market, specifically to the western section where raccoon dogs were caged, and it provided strong evidence of a live-animal market origin of the pandemic.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/astrazeneca-antibody-drug-works-prevent-covid-19-longer-term-studies/,AstraZeneca COVID-19 antibody drug offers 83% protection over 6 months,"AstraZeneca on Thursday, November 18, cemented its lead in bringing a preventative COVID-19 shot for the non-infected to market for people who do not respond well to vaccines, saying its antibody drug cocktail offered 83% protection over six months.
The injected therapy, called AZD7442 or Evusheld, had previously been shown to confer 77% protection against symptomatic illness after three months, in an earlier readout of the late-stage PROVENT trial in August.
The Anglo-Swedish company also said a separate study in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 showed a higher dose of AZD7442 cut the risk of symptoms worsening by 88% when given within three days of first symptoms.
The latest results from longer-term follow-ups potentially position AstraZeneca, like rival Pfizer as a future supplier of both COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, with AstraZeneca having said the therapy’s “real advantage” was as a preventative shot.
“These new data add to the growing body of evidence supporting AZD7442’s potential to make a significant difference in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19,” Executive Vice President Mene Pangalos said in a statement.  Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/countries-weigh-need-for-booster-covid-19-shots-november-17-2021/,Countries weigh need for booster COVID-19 shots,"Many countries are rolling out COVID-19 vaccine booster shots, but there is no consensus among scientists that they are necessary and the World Health Organization wants the most vulnerable people worldwide to be fully vaccinated first.
Here are some of the options countries and regions are considering:
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on September 24 backed a booster shot of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine for Americans aged 65 and older, some adults with underlying medical conditions and some adults in high-risk working and institutional settings.
Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization is recommending  booster shots of an authorized mRNA vaccine to those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised.
The European Union’s drug regulator recommended on October  4 a third dose of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines for those with a severely weakened immune system, but left it to member states to decide whether the wider population should get a booster.
Recent contracts with Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have included the potential for the bloc to buy booster shots.
These European countries are offering boosters to adults after they receive a full dose of a vaccine:
● Austria; Czech Republic; Germany; Hungary; Italy (Pfizer or Moderna booster shots for all inoculated, and for all those who have received a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine; Malta (all over-12s); Norway; Poland; Russia; Romania (only boosters from Pfizer or Moderna were approved); Serbia; Slovakia; Spain (Pfizer or Moderna booster shots for all inoculated with J&J)
These countries are offering boosters to people with weak immune systems, the elderly or vulnerable:
●  Belgium (mRNA); Bulgaria; Britain (plans to extend rollout to over-40s from over-50s); Denmark; Finland (may expand to other Finns later in the autumn); France (so far available only to over-65s, will be offered to over-50s from December); Ireland; Italy; Lithuania; Netherlands (over-60s); Portugal; Slovenia; Spain; Sweden (larger population to get a jab in 2022); Switzerland (new recommendation for people under 65 expected in the next few weeks)
● Morocco, which has administered the most doses in Africa, started giving a third dose beginning in October.
●  Tunisia (5 months after second dose)
● Nigeria is trying to secure booster shots, the head of the presidential steering committee on COVID-19 said on Nov 15.
These countries are offering boosters to adults after they receive a full dose:
● Bahrain (Sputnik V, all over-18s at least six months after second dose); Cambodia (AstraZeneca); Indonesia (health workers only, wider population planned in 2022); Israel (all over-12s); South Korea (initial doses to high-risk groups or people with weakened immune systems); Turkey; Thailand (AstraZeneca or mRNA-type booster shots to people who were administered Sinovac brand); UAE (mandatory for people inoculated with Sinopharm vaccine).
These countries are offering boosters to people with weak immune systems, the elderly or vulnerable:
● China; Hong Kong; Singapore
AUSTRALIA began administering Pfizer COVID booster shots in
November to fully vaccinated adults.
These countries are offering boosters to adults after they receive a full dose:
●  Brazil; Uruguay (offers a Pfizer dose for those fully vaccinated with Sinovac)
These countries are offering boosters only to the immunosuppressed:
● Ecuador, Panama
These are offering boosters to elderly, vulnerable and at-risk people:
●  Chile; Brazil; Dominican Republic, El Salvador (elderly, health workers, people with underlying health conditions)
The US Food and Drug Administration authorized on September 22 a booster dose of the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for those 65 and older, all people at high risk of severe disease, and others who are regularly exposed to the virus.
The FDA authorized a third dose by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Inc on August 13 for people with compromised immune systems.
Pfizer and BioNTech have also requested FDA approval for the use of their booster shots for all adults.
The FDA cleared in October booster shots of vaccines from Moderna and J&J.
The European Union’s drug regulator (EMA) authorized the use of Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 booster shots for over-18s, at least six months after the second dose.
EMA is also considering an authorization for AstraZeneca’s booster dose.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/pfizer-allow-generic-versions-covid-pill-95-countries/,Pfizer to allow generic versions of its COVID-19 pill in 95 countries,"Pfizer Inc said on Tuesday, November 16, it will allow generic manufacturers to supply its experimental antiviral COVID-19 pill to 95 low- and middle-income countries through a licensing agreement with international public health group Medicines Patent Pool (MPP).
The voluntary licensing agreement between Pfizer and the MPP will allow the UN-backed group to grant sub-licenses to qualified generic drug manufacturers to make their own versions of PF-07321332. Pfizer will sell the pills it manufactures under the brand name Paxlovid.
Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said it was “disheartened” by the deal which it said was restrictive and excluded countries such as Argentina and China with established capacity for producing generic drugs.
“The world knows by now that access to COVID-19 medical tools needs to be guaranteed for everyone, everywhere, if we really want to control this pandemic,” said Yuanqiong Hu, MSF Senior Legal Policy Adviser.
Pfizer, which also makes one of the mostly widely used COVID-19 vaccines, has said the pill cut the chance of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of severe disease by 89% in its clinical trial. The drug will be used in combination with ritonavir, an HIV drug that is already available generically.
Pfizer’s licensing deal follows a similar arrangement by rival Merck & Co for generic manufacturing of its COVID-19 treatment. The deals are unusual arrangements that acknowledge the dire need for effective treatments as well as the pressure drugmakers are under to make their life-saving drugs accessible at very low costs.
“We are extremely pleased to have another weapon in our armory to protect people from the ravages of COVID-19,” Charles Gore, Executive Director of the Medicines Patent Pool, said in an interview.
Gore said he hoped the generic version of Pfizer’s drug would be available within months.
The 95 countries in the agreement cover around 53% of the world’s population and include all low- and lower-middle-income countries and some upper-middle-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. They also include countries that have transitioned from lower-middle to upper-middle-income status in the past five years, Pfizer and the MPP said.
“We must work to ensure that all people – regardless of where they live or their circumstances – have access to these breakthroughs,” Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in a statement.
Pfizer will waive royalties on sales in low-income countries. It will also waive them in the other countries covered by the agreement as long as COVID-19 remains classified as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization.
Pfizer’s version of the drug will be in high demand. The company has said it expects to manufacture 180,000 treatment courses by the end of next month and at least 50 million courses by the end of 2022.
Even so, the drugmaker could be stretched trying to supply 47% of the world’s population. A Pfizer executive said last week the market for the drug might be up to 150 million people and that many countries might also be interested in buying doses for their strategic reserves.
Pfizer has said it will sell the supply it produces using a tiered pricing approach based on the income level of each country. In the United States, it expects to price its treatment close to where Merck has priced its drug at around $700 a course.
Merck has license agreements for it COVID-19 pill, molnupiravir, in over 100 countries. Still, some international health officials said even that is not enough for the medicine to reach many in low- and middle-income countries in large enough numbers.",Reuters,"Nov 16, 2021 11:50 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/eu-lists-rare-spinal-condition-side-effect-johnson-johnson-covid-19-shot/,EU lists rare spinal condition as side effect of J&J COVID-19 shot,"Europe’s drug regulator on Thursday, November 11, recommended adding a rare type of spinal inflammation called transverse myelitis as a side effect of Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine.
Reports of this serious neurological illness was also at the heart of trial halts in the early stages of development for both AstraZeneca and J&J’s shots, which are based on similar technology.
Giving updates on the safety of all coronavirus shots, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it was assessing reports of a rare blood condition known as capillary leak syndrome (CLS) following inoculation with Moderna’s vaccine.
The EMA said it had recorded six cases of CLS and was assessing all data, but it was not yet clear if there was a causal association between the reports and the vaccine.
In CLS, fluids leak from the smallest blood vessels causing swelling and a drop in blood pressure. The condition has also been studied with vaccines from AstraZeneca and J&J.
The EMA said there was currently not enough evidence of a possible link between rare cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) and mRNA-based vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
The regulator is reviewing if approved coronavirus vaccines could cause MIS. The syndrome is a serious but rare condition in which different body parts become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs.

So said a slew of panelists Tuesday, November 9, at the UN climate talks in Glasgow, warning about escalating climate-linked health threats such as disease, heatstroke and air pollution.
But they also called out the health systems in rich nations as part of the problem, with the healthcare sector responsible for up to 5% of global carbon emissions.
“We need to recognize the role of health systems as emitters,” said Rachel Levine, the US assistant secretary of health. “We cannot stand back and only tell others what they should do to protect our patients.”
The main sources of emissions from the healthcare sector include the manufacture and transport of medical goods, as well as the construction and operation of hospitals and clinics.
On Tuesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced dozens of governments had committed to reduce emissions in their health systems or to transition entirely to net-zero.
Speakers also called on countries to get ready for more climate-linked illnesses and casualties.
Already, climate change is worsening food and water security, while deadly heatwaves and floods are testing communities around the world.
Medical systems are often being strained if not damaged by these same types of events.
Fiji’s UN Ambassador Satyendra Prasad described the challenge of keeping medical facilities open in the midst of superstorms and floods that are battering the Pacific island nation.
“It’s quite tragic when your doctors and nurses are themselves being evacuated, when they should be providing frontline services,” he said.
Fiji is also seeing more waterborne diseases in the flooding after storms, he said.
Vulnerable countries need money to move medical facilities to higher ground and to train health professionals to deal with climate-linked health issues, he said.
Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, now the WHO ambassador on global health finance, called on rich countries to keep their promise to provide $100 billion a year in climate financing for poorer nations. That money, he said, could be used to bolster healthcare worldwide.
Doctors have said the best way to prevent spiraling public health dangers is to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
An editorial run in 233 health journals urged the same, saying that passing the 1.5ºC threshold risks “catastrophic harm to health that will be impossible to reverse.”
“Although COVID has been a deadly disease, climate change will take more lives in the next 50 to 100 years than anything that that [the coronavirus] disease will do,” Brown said. “We need to keep 1.5 degrees alive to keep millions of people alive.”",Reuters,"Nov 9, 2021 11:41 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-warns-shortage-billions-covid-19-vaccine-syringes/,WHO warns of shortage of 1-2 billion COVID-19 vaccine syringes,"There could be a shortage of one to two billion syringes needed to administer COVID-19 vaccinations in 2022 which could also impact routine immunizations and undermine needle safety, the World Health Organization warned on Tuesday, November 9.
National health authorities should plan their needs well in advance to avoid the “hoarding, panic buying and type of situation” seen early in the pandemic with the lack of personal protective equipment, WHO expert Lisa Hedman said.
“We could have a global shortage of immunization syringes that could in turn lead to serious problems such as slowing down immunization efforts as well as safety concerns,” she told a UN briefing.
A shortage could lead to delays in routine vaccinations, particularly for children, and other health services, and it could also encourage the unsafe reusing of syringes and needles, particularly in poorer countries, Hedman added.
About 6.8 billion COVID-19 vaccinations have been administered globally, almost double the number of routine vaccines, Hedman said, compared to total manufacturing capacity of about 6 billion immunization syringes a year.
That means the world could face a shortage of up to two billion syringes next year, unless more factories are shifted to producing the right kind of device for shots, Hedman said.
“If we shift capacity from one type of syringe to another or attempt to expand capacity for specialized immunization syringes, it takes time and investment,” she said.",Reuters,"Nov 9, 2021 9:21 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/french-health-authority-advises-against-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-under-30s/,French health authority advises vs Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for under 30s,"France’s public health authority has recommended people under 30 be given Pfizer’s Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine when available instead of Moderna Inc’s Spikevax jab, which carried comparatively higher risks of heart-related problems.
The Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS), which does not have legal power to ban or license drugs but acts as an advisor to the French health sector, cited “very rare” risks linked to myocarditis, a heart disease, that had shown up in recent data on the Moderna vaccine and in a French study published on Monday, November 8.
“Within the population aged under 30, this risk appears to be around five times lesser with Pfizer’s Comirnaty jab compared to Moderna’s Spikevax jab,” HAS said in its opinion published on Monday.
HAS said that its recommendation, which would apply regardless of the vaccine’s use as a first, second or third “booster” dose, would be valid until more scientific findings on the matter are known.
For persons aged over 30, however, the authority explicitly recommended the use of the Moderna vaccine, saying its effectiveness was slightly superior.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-pills-no-substitute-vaccines-disease-experts-say/,"COVID-19 pills are coming, but no substitute for vaccines, disease experts say","Oral antiviral pills from Merck & Co and Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE have been shown to significantly blunt the worst outcomes of COVID-19 if taken early enough, but doctors warn vaccine hesitant people not to confuse the benefit of the treatments with prevention afforded by vaccines.
While 72% of American adults have gotten a first shot of the vaccine, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll, the pace of vaccination has slowed, as political partisanship in the United States divides views on the value and safety of vaccines against the coronavirus.
Vaccine mandates by employers, states and the administration of US President Joe Biden have helped increase vaccinations but also fueled that controversy.
Some disease experts fear the arrival of oral COVID-19 treatments may further impede vaccination campaigns. Preliminary results of a survey of 3,000 US citizens by the City University of New York (CUNY) School of Public Health suggest the drugs could “hamper the effort to get people vaccinated,” said Scott Ratzan, an expert in health communication at CUNY, who led the research.
Ratzan said one out of every eight of those surveyed said they would rather get treated with a pill than be vaccinated. “That is a high number,” Ratzan said.
The concern follows news on Friday from Pfizer, maker of a leading COVID-19 vaccine, that its experimental antiviral pill Paxlovid cut the risk of hospitalization and death from the disease by 89% in high-risk adults.
Pfizer’s results followed news from Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics on Oct. 1 that their oral antiviral drug cut hospitalization and death by half. That drug, known as molnupiravir, won conditional approval in the UK on Thursday. Both need clearance from US health regulators but could be on the market in December.
“By relying exclusively on an antiviral drug, it’s a bit of a roll of the dice in terms of how you will do. Clearly, it’s going to be better than nothing, but it’s a high-stakes game to play,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert and professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine.
Six infectious disease experts interviewed by Reuters were equally enthusiastic about the prospect of effective new treatments for COVID-19 and agreed they were no substitute for vaccines.
Even in the face of the highly transmissible Delta variant of the virus, the vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech remain effective, cutting the risk of hospitalization by a combined 86.8%, according to a government study of US veterans.
They said some unvaccinated people have already relied on monoclonal antibodies – drugs that need to be delivered through intravenous IV infusions or injections – as a backstop in case they become infected.
“I think the Pfizer news is terrific news. It goes hand in hand with vaccination. It doesn’t replace it,” said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University and Baltimore’s former health commissioner.
Choosing not to get vaccinated “would be a tragic mistake,” said Albert Bourla, chief executive officer of Pfizer Inc. “These are treatments. This is for the unfortunate who will get sick,” Bourla told Reuters in an interview on Friday. “This should not be a reason not to protect yourself and to put yourself, your household and society in danger.”
One main reason not to rely on the new pills, the experts said, is that antiviral medications, which stop the virus from replicating in the body, must be given in a narrow window early in the disease because COVID-19 has different phases.
In the first phase, the virus rapidly replicates in the body. A lot of the worst effects of COVID-19, however, occur in the second phase, arising from a defective immune response that gets triggered by the replicating virus, said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease expert and the CEO and founder of Just Human Productions, a non-profit multimedia organization.
“Once you develop shortness of breath or other symptoms that would lead you to be hospitalized, you are in that dysfunctional immune phase where the antivirals are really not going to provide much benefit,” she said.
Hotez agreed. He said getting treated early enough could be challenging because the window when the virus transitions from the replication phase to the inflammatory phase is fluid.
“For some people, that will happen earlier; for some, later,” Hotez said.
Hotez said many people in the early phase of the illness feel surprisingly well and may be unaware that their oxygen levels are dropping, one of the first signs that the inflammatory phase of the disease has started.
“Oftentimes, you’re not going to realize that you’re getting sick until it’s too late,” he said.",Reuters,"Nov 9, 2021 7:43 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/gene-linked-doubling-risk-covid-19-death-found-uk-scientists/,Gene linked to doubling risk of COVID-19 death found by UK scientists,"British scientists have identified a version of a gene that may be associated with double the risk of lung failure from COVID-19, a finding that provides new insights into why some people are more susceptible than others to severe illness and which opens possibilities for targeted medicine.
The high-risk genetic variant is in a chromosome region that is also tied to double the risk of death in COVID-19 patients under age 60.
Around 60% of people with South Asian ancestry carry the high-risk version of the gene, researchers at Oxford University said on Friday, November 5, adding the discovery may partly explain the high number of deaths seen in some British communities, and the devastation wrought by COVID-19 in the Indian subcontinent.
The scientists found the increased risk comes from a gene that regulates activity of other genes, including one called LZTFL1 involved in the response of lung cells to viruses.
As a result, the gene variant could inhibit proper response to the virus among cells lining airways and the lungs.
However, LZTFL1 does not affect the immune system that makes antibodies to fight off infections, researchers said, adding that people carrying the variant should respond normally to vaccines.
The study “shows that the way in which the lung responds to the infection is critical. This is important because most treatments have focused on changing the way in which the immune system reacts to the virus,” said Professor James Davies, co-lead of the study.
Dr. Raghib Ali of the University of Cambridge, an adviser on COVID-19 and ethnicity to the UK Cabinet Office, said in a statement that even after accounting for higher rates of COVID-19 risk factors such as work in public-facing jobs and housing in densely populated areas, “there has been an unexplained residual excess risk in South Asians.”
This new study, he added, shows “that this may be due to them being more likely to carry this gene which increases their risk of death once infected.”

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-antiviral-pill-covid-19-trial-results/,Pfizer says antiviral pill cuts risk of severe COVID-19 by 89%,"A trial of Pfizer Inc’s experimental antiviral pill for COVID-19 was stopped early after the drug was shown to cut by 89% the chances of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of developing severe disease, the company said on Friday, November 5.
The results appear to surpass those seen with Merck & Co Inc’s pill, molnupiravir, which was shown last month to halve the likelihood of dying or being hospitalized for COVID-19 patients also at high risk of serious illness.
Full trial data is not yet available from either company.
Pfizer shares surged 13% to $49.47, while those of Merck fell 6% to $84.69.
Pfizer said it plans to submit interim trial results for its pill, which is given in combination with an older antiviral called ritonavir, to the US Food and Drug Administration as part of the emergency use application it opened in October.
The combination treatment, which will have the brand name Paxlovid, consists of three pills given twice daily.
The planned analysis of 1,219 patients in Pfizer’s study looked at hospitalizations or deaths among people diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 with at least one risk factor for developing severe disease, such as obesity or older age.
It found that 0.8% of those given Pfizer’s drug within three days of symptom onset were hospitalized and none had died by 28 days after treatment. That compared with a hospitalization rate of 7% for placebo patients. There were also seven deaths in the placebo group.
Rates were similar for patients treated within five days of symptoms – 1% of the treatment group was hospitalized, compared with 6.7% for the placebo group, which included 10 deaths.
Antivirals need to be given as early as possible, before an infection takes hold, in order to be most effective. Merck tested its drug within five days of symptom onset.
“We saw that we did have high efficacy, even if it was five days after a patient has been treated … people might wait a couple of days before getting a test or something, and this means that we have time to treat people and really provide a benefit from a public health perspective,” Annaliesa Anderson, head of the Pfizer program, told Reuters.
The company did not detail side effects of the treatment, but said adverse events happened in about 20% of both treatment and placebo patients.
“These data suggest that our oral antiviral candidate, if approved by regulatory authorities, has the potential to save patients’ lives, reduce the severity of COVID-19 infections, and eliminate up to nine out of ten hospitalizations,” Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in a statement.
Pfizer said it was currently expecting to produce more than 180,000 packs by the end of 2021 and at least 50 million packs by the end of 2022, of which 21 million would be produced in the first half.
“We are currently bringing on additional capacity and ramping up further and we look forward to updating these numbers in the coming weeks,” the company said.
Infectious disease experts stress that preventing COVID-19 through wide use of vaccines remains the best way to control the pandemic, but only 58% of Americans are fully vaccinated and access in many parts of the world is limited.
Pfizer’s drug, part of a class known as protease inhibitors, is designed to block an enzyme the coronavirus needs in order to multiply.
Merck’s molnupiravir has a different mechanism of action designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus. Merck has already sold millions of courses of the treatment, which was approved this week by UK regulators, to the United States, the UK and others.
Britain said earlier this month it had secured 250,000 courses of Pfizer’s antiviral.

Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommended the drug, molnupiravir, be used as soon as possible following a positive COVID-19 test and within five days of the onset of symptoms, citing clinical data.
This is the first oral antiviral treatment for COVID-19 to get approved, with the green light coming ahead of potential US regulatory clearance. US advisers will meet this month to vote on whether molnupiravir should be authorized.
Treatments to tackle the pandemic, which has killed more than 5.2 million people worldwide, have so far focused mainly on vaccines. Other options, including Gilead’s infused antiviral remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone, are generally only given after a patient has been hospitalized.
Merck’s Molnupiravir has been closely watched since data last month showed it could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalized for those most at risk of developing severe COVID-19 when given early in the illness.
The drug, to be branded Lagevrio in Britain, is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus that causes COVID-19 and is taken twice a day for five days.
The British government and the country’s National Health Service (NHS) will confirm how the treatment will be deployed to patients in “due course.”
“We are working at pace across the government and with the NHS to set out plans to deploy molnupiravir to patients through a national study as soon as possible,” health secretary Sajid Javid said in a statement.
The speedy approval in Britain comes as the government struggles to tame soaring infections.
The country has about 40,000 daily cases of COVID-19, according to the latest seven-day average. That total is second only to the roughly 74,000 a day in the United States, which has five times more people.
Data released on Wednesday night, November 3, showed COVID-19 prevalence in England hit its highest level on record last month, led by a high numbers of cases in children and a surge in the south-west of the country.
Pressure is growing on the government to implement its “Plan B” aimed at protecting the NHS from unsustainable demands, involving mask mandates, vaccine passes and work-from-home orders.
Last month, Britain agreed a deal with Merck to secure 480,000 courses of molnupiravir.
In a separate statement, Merck said it was expecting to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of this year, with at least 20 million set to be manufactured in 2022.
The US based drugmaker’s shares were up 2.1% at $90.54 before the market open.
Pfizer and Roche are also racing to develop easy-to-administer antiviral pills for COVID-19. Pfizer last month began a large study of its oral antiviral drug for the prevention of COVID-19 in people exposed to the coronavirus.
Merck’s molnupiravir is also being studied in a late-stage trial for preventing infection.
Viral sequencing done so far has shown molnupiravir is effective against all variants of the coronavirus, Merck has said, including the more-infectious Delta, which is responsible for the worldwide surge in hospitalizations and deaths recently.
While it is not yet clear when Merck will deliver doses to Britain, the company has said it is committed to providing timely access to its drug globally with plans for tiered pricing aligned with a country’s ability to pay.
Merck is also in talks with generic drugmakers about expanding manufacturing licenses to build supply of the treatment.

The emergency use listing would allow Bharat Biotech to ship the shot known as Covaxin to countries that rely on WHO guidance for their regulatory decisions. It could also help millions of Indians who have received the shot to travel outside the country.
The WHO tweet its technical advisory group had ruled that Covaxin’s benefits significantly outweighed the risks and that it met WHO standards for protection against COVID-19.
The advisory group was expected to make a decision on Covaxin last week, but had asked for additional clarifications from Bharat Biotech before conducting a final risk-benefit assessment for the vaccine’s global use.
Covaxin was also reviewed by the WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, which recommended its use in two doses, with an interval of four weeks, in all age groups 18 and above.
Bharat Biotech’s vaccine is the seventh to win WHO backing following two mRNA shots from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, adenovirus vector vaccines developed by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, and China’s inactivated vaccines from Sinovac Biotech and Sinopharm.
The WHO’s approval may also clear the way for India to commit supplies to the COVAX global vaccine sharing effort, which is co-led by the WHO and aims to provide equitable access to shots for low- and middle-income countries.
Last month, Reuters reported the country was delaying a deal on that while the WHO considered the Covaxin shot for approval.

Speaking to the Group of 20 Leaders’ Summit in Rome via video link, Xi said China had provided more than 1.6 billion COVID shots to the world, and was working with 16 nations to cooperate on manufacturing doses.
“China is willing to work with all parties to improve the accessibility and affordability of COVID-19 vaccines in developing countries,” Xi said.
Xi reiterated China’s support of the World Trade Organization (WTO) making an early decision on waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines, and he called for vaccine companies to be encouraged to transfer technology to developing countries.
Two Chinese vaccines, one from Sinovac Biotech and one from Sinopharm, have been included in the WHO’s emergency use list.
Xi also called for policies to maintain global economic and financial stability, saying China will strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and maintain policy continuity, stability and sustainability.
“Major economies should adopt responsible macroeconomic policies to avoid negative spillover effects to developing countries and maintain the steady operation of the international economic and financial system,” he said.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/tedros-sole-nominee-who-chief-october-2021/,"Tedros sole nominee as WHO chief, UN agency says","Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has steered the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is on course to serve a second five-year term as head of the World Health Organization (WHO) after being the only candidate nominated by 28 countries.
Tedros, a former health and foreign minister of Ethiopia, was the first African elected WHO director-general in May 2017.
The clean slate for the May election comes even as the European Commission suspending funding to WHO programs in the Democratic Republic of Congo over a major sexual abuse scandal, as reported exclusively by Reuters on Thursday, October 28.
Some 83 aid workers, a quarter of them employed by the WHO, were involved in sexual exploitation and abuse during Congo’s 2018-2020 Ebola epidemic, an independent probe said last month.
Health ministers from the WHO’s 194 member states are also due to hold an exceptional assembly in November amid mounting pressure for reform pursuant to the organization’s handling of the pandemic.
Tedros drew support from France and Germany, among other European Union members, and three African countries – Botswana, Kenya and Rwanda – the official nomination list showed. Britain, China, Russia and the United States were not among them.
“WHO can announce that a single candidate was proposed by member states by the 23 September 2021 deadline: Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is the incumbent director-general,” the agency said in a statement. The nominations were kept secret to limit lengthy campaigning.
Earlier, the agency sent a letter to member states informing them of the confidential nominations contained in the sealed envelopes submitted by the deadline
Ethiopia declined to nominate Tedros for a second term due to friction over the conflict in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, making it necessary for other countries to step in and do so.
The issue is so sensitive that the African Union has not even discussed the appointment, including at its latest summit this month, African diplomats said.
Tedros has led the global response to COVID-19, the worst public health crisis in a century, which broke out in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and has killed 5.2 million people.
The United States, under former President Donald Trump, accused him of being “China-centric,” a charge he denies. Relations have warmed since Joe Biden’s administration took office in January.
But he annoyed China with public calls in July for it to share Wuhan lab audits and provide more data on early COVID-19 cases. WHO investigators have yet to regain access to the country to probe the origins of coronavirus.
The United States and Germany have led major donors in demanding fundamental reforms to the WHO’s structure, financing and capacity to deal with outbreaks.
The European Commission informed the WHO on October 7 that it was immediately suspending funding to its Congo programs due to concerns over its handling of the sexual abuse scandal. Tedros went to Congo 14 times during the epidemic but says that he was unaware of the allegations.
“We have received the (EU) letter and we are now considering a response,” WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris told a briefing on Friday, October 29.
A European source, asked whether the Congo scandal could have an impact on Tedros’ reelection, said: “Nope. He personally is taking the right steps and measures. As long as there is not a direct link to him. Which I don’t see.”
An African ambassador in Geneva, declining to be identified, said: “Dr. Tedros has done a very good job dealing with a severe pandemic with severe repercussions. He has tried to contribute within the capacity and the resources of WHO and to realize a more equitable distribution of vaccines at the global level.”
“He is a friend of Africa, he has done a lot of work and deserves a lot of support,” the ambassador said.
Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere, speaking at a news briefing with Tedros on Thursday, where the WHO launched a $23.4 billion plan to bring COVID-19 vaccines and drugs to poorer countries, told him:

Its inventor hopes the Wondaleaf Unisex Condom will empower people to take better control of their sexual health regardless of their sex or sexual orientation.
“It’s basically a regular condom with an adhesive covering,” said John Tang Ing Chinh, a gynacologist at medical supplies firm Twin Catalyst.
“It’s a condom with an adhesive covering that attaches to the vagina or penis, as well as covering the adjacent area for extra protection,” Tang said.
The adhesive is only applied to one side of the condom, he added, meaning it can be reversed and used by either sex.
Each box of Wondaleaf contains two condoms, and will cost 14.99 ringgit ($3.61). The average price for a dozen condoms in Malaysia is 20-40 ringgit.
Tang makes the condoms using polyurethane, a material used in transparent wound dressings that is thin and flexible yet strong and waterproof.
“Once you put it on, you often don’t realise that it’s there,” he said, referring to dressings made from the material.
Tang said the Wondaleaf had gone through several rounds of clinical research and testing and would be available commercially via the firm’s website this December.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/rise-human-bird-flu-cases-china-risk-fast-changing-variants/,Rise in human bird flu cases in China shows risk of fast-changing variants – health experts,"A jump in the number of people in China infected with bird flu this year is raising concern among experts, who say a previously circulating strain appears to have changed and may be more infectious to people.
China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza in 2021 to the World Health Organization (WHO), compared with only five last year, it said.
Though the numbers are much lower than the hundreds infected with H7N9 in 2017, the infections are serious, leaving many critically ill, and at least six dead.
“The increase in human cases in China this year is of concern. It’s a virus that causes high mortality,” said Thijs Kuiken, professor of comparative pathology at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam.
Most of the cases had come into contact with poultry, and there are no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission, said the WHO, which highlighted the rise in cases in a statement on October 4.
It said further investigation was “urgently” required to understand the risk and the increase in spill over to people.
Since then, a 60-year-old woman in Hunan province was admitted to hospital in a critical condition with H5N6 influenza on Oct. 13, according to a Hong Kong government statement.
While human H5N6 cases have been reported, no outbreaks of H5N6 have been reported in poultry in China since February 2020.
China is the world’s biggest poultry producer and top producer of ducks, which act as a reservoir for flu viruses.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could not be reached for comment on the rise in H5N6 human cases. However, a study published on its website last month said the “increasing genetic diversity and geographical distribution of H5N6 pose a serious threat to the poultry industry and human health.”
Avian influenza viruses constantly circulate in domestic and wild birds, but rarely infect people. However, the evolution of the viruses, which have increased as poultry populations grow, is a major concern because they could change into a virus that spreads easily between people and cause a pandemic.
The largest number of H5N6 infections have been in southwestern Sichuan province, though cases have also been reported in neighboring Chongqing and Guangxi, as well as Guangdong, Anhui and Hunan provinces.
At least 10 were caused by viruses genetically very similar to the H5N8 virus that ravaged poultry farms across Europe last winter and also killed wild birds in China. That suggests the latest H5N6 infections in China may be a new variant.
“It could be that this variant is a little more infectious (to people)…or there could be more of this virus in poultry at the moment and that’s why more people are getting infected,” said Kuiken.
Four of the Sichuan cases raised poultry at home and had been in contact with dead birds, said a September report by China’s CDC. Another had bought a duck from a live poultry market a week before developing symptoms.
China vaccinates poultry against avian influenza but the vaccine used last year may only partially protect against emerging viruses, preventing large outbreaks but allowing the virus to keep circulating, said Filip Claes, Regional Laboratory Coordinator at the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the Food and Agriculture Organization.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.
Backyard farms in China are common and many people still prefer to buy live chickens at markets.

At the Laging Handa briefing on Saturday, October 23, DOST Undersecretary Rowena Guevara said that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has labeling requirements – in this case, that these could be used as alternative treatments for COVID-19.
“Ang requirement ng DOH (Department of Health) kailangang mailagay ng FDA sa mga label na ito ay para sa COVID-19. Para magawa ‘yon, may kailangan pa tayong gawin na study na kung saan ‘yong live virus mismo ang paggagamitan natin nitong VCO, lagundi, at saka tawa-tawa,” said Guevara.
(The DOH’s requirement is that the FDA should be able to put in the label that this could be used against COVID-19. To do that, we still need to do another study where we test VCO, lagundi, and tawa-tawa against the live virus.)
But Guevara said that the Philippines does not have a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory where the coronavirus can be handled.
“Gagawin pa natin ito sa ibang bansa. (We have to do this in another country),” said Guevara.
In the region, Indonesia, India, and Singapore have BSL-3 laboratories.
“‘Yung ating mga clinic trials na ginawa, ngayong hindi pa niya ma-establish ‘yong anti-viral properties, na-establish na niya ‘yong nagagawa nitong tatlong ito sa sintomas ng COVID-19,” said Guevara.
(With the clinical trials we have done, while the anti-viral properties have yet to be established, we already established what it could do with the symptoms.)
Based on the results of the clinical trial done in the lab, VCO decreased the coronavirus count by 60% to 90% for asymptomatic and mild cases of COVID-19.
In community trials, VCO reduced the symptoms, which could have prevented the progression of the infection.
Lagundi helps in stopping the loss of smell symptom. Guevara said that the study team found that lagundi could be used for patients with mild symptoms who do not have comorbidities.
Trials using tawa-tawa, meanwhile, showed that symptoms disappear between the third and fifth day since it was given to them.
Asked if other countries have taken notice of the Philippine study, Guevara answered in the affirmative and said that they have been exchanging notes with some of their counterparts.
In April 2020, the DOST said it was conducting clinical studies on the possible benefits of VCO for COVID-19 patients.

https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/united-states-fda-says-benefits-outweigh-risks-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-children/,US FDA says benefits outweigh risks for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in children,"Scientists at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Friday, October 22, that the likely benefits of giving the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to 5 to 11-year-olds clearly outweigh the risks of rare cases of heart inflammation.
Earlier on Friday, the vaccine makers said their shot showed 90.7% efficacy against the coronavirus in a clinical trial of children 5 to 11 years old.
The details were in briefing documents published ahead of a meeting of a panel of outside experts scheduled to vote on Tuesday whether to recommend the FDA authorize the shots for the young age group.
If the FDA authorizes the Pfizer/BioNTech immunization for children 5 to 11 years old, it would be the first COVID-19 vaccine for the age group and shots could be available in the United States in early November.
Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Inc. vaccines have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation called myocarditis, especially in young men.
The FDA staff said that, assuming the number of myocarditis cases observed in the younger age group would be similar to that seen in 12 to 15 year-olds, the number of COVID-19 related hospitalizations prevented would outnumber myocarditis-related hospitalizations in most scenarios analyzed.
Pfizer suggested in its own briefing documents that the rate of myocarditis in the age group was likely to be lower than observed in vaccinated 12 to 15-year-olds, in part because the younger children were given a lower dose.
The 5 to 11-year-olds were given two shots of a 10-microgram dose, a third of what was given to people 12 years and older.
Sixteen children in the trial who had received a placebo got COVID-19, versus three who were vaccinated, Pfizer said in briefing documents submitted to the FDA.
Because more than twice as many children in the 2,268-participant trial were given the vaccine than placebo, that equates to better than 90% efficacy.
Pfizer’s clinical trial in those 5 to 11 years old was not primarily designed to measure efficacy against the virus.
Instead, it compared the amount of neutralizing antibodies induced by the vaccine in the children to the response of older recipients in their adult trial.
Based on those results, Pfizer and BioNTech said last month that their COVID-19 vaccine induced a robust immune response in the children. The FDA staff said the vaccine met the agency’s criteria for the immune response it generated in the children.
Pfizer also said on Friday that it had expanded its clinical trial to improve its safety data, more than doubling the number of children enrolled.
According to Pfizer, the adverse event profile in the expanded group did not suggest any new safety concerns from the vaccine. The company had said previously that the safety profile in the age group was generally comparable to 16 to 25-year-olds.
The second cohort of children has been observed for a shorter time. All of them had received their second dose and more than 70% were more than two weeks post dose two.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine already has US regulatory authorization for people who are at least 12 years old, including full FDA approval in August for those 16 and up.
Around 190 million people in the United States are fully vaccinated, including more than 11 million who are 12 to 17 years old that have received the Pfizer vaccine.
If the FDA authorizes the vaccine for 5 to 11-year-olds, a group of advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will meet on November 2 to 3 to make recommendations to the agency on how the shots should be administered.

“It’s generally recommended that you get the booster that is the original regimen that you got in the first place,” Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview with CNN.
“But for one reason or other – and there may be different circumstances with people, availability or just different personal choices – you can, as we say, mix and match,” Fauci said in an interview with CNN.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday recommended the COVID-19 vaccine boosters for recipients of the Moderna Inc and Johnson & Johnson shots, and said Americans can choose a different shot from their original inoculation as a booster.
Fauci’s comments contrasted with the recommendations from the CDC and Food and Drug Administration this week, which said that Americans should get boosters but did not specify which combinations would be best.
The recommendations also opened the door for recipients of the one-shot J&J vaccine to get a dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines that have been shown to afford greater protection in a variety of studies.
“You can now mix and match one with the other, but in general it just makes sense to go with what your original regimen was,” Fauci said.
Although these vaccines have been highly effective in preventing serious illness and death, some government scientists have suggested that boosters are needed to keep immunity high, especially as the extremely contagious Delta variant can cause breakthrough infections among some who are fully vaccinated.",Reuters,"Oct 22, 2021 11:52 PM PHT"

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/surgeons-successfully-test-pig-kidney-transplant-human-patient/,US surgeons successfully test pig kidney transplant in human patient,"For the first time, a pig kidney has been transplanted into a human without triggering immediate rejection by the recipient’s immune system, a potentially major advance that could eventually help alleviate a dire shortage of human organs for transplant.
The procedure done at NYU Langone Health in New York City involved use of a pig whose genes had been altered so that its tissues no longer contained a molecule known to trigger almost immediate rejection.
The recipient was a brain-dead patient with signs of kidney dysfunction whose family consented to the experiment before she was due to be taken off of life support, researchers told Reuters.
For three days, the new kidney was attached to her blood vessels and maintained outside her body, giving researchers access to it.
Test results of the transplanted kidney’s function “looked pretty normal,” said transplant surgeon Dr. Robert Montgomery, who led the study.
The kidney made “the amount of urine that you would expect” from a transplanted human kidney, he said, and there was no evidence of the vigorous, early rejection seen when unmodified pig kidneys are transplanted into non-human primates.
The recipient’s abnormal creatinine level – an indicator of poor kidney function – returned to normal after the transplant, Montgomery said.
In the United States, nearly 107,000 people are presently waiting for organ transplants, including more than 90,000 awaiting a kidney, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. Wait times for a kidney average three to five years.
Researchers have been working for decades on the possibility of using animal organs for transplants, but have been stymied over how to prevent immediate rejection by the human body.
Montgomery’s team theorized that knocking out the pig gene for a carbohydrate that triggers rejection – a sugar molecule, or glycan, called alpha-gal – would prevent the problem.
The genetically altered pig, dubbed GalSafe, was developed by United Therapeutics Corp’s Revivicor unit. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in December 2020, for use as food for people with a meat allergy and as a potential source of human therapeutics.
Medical products developed from the pigs would still require specific FDA approval before being used in humans, the agency said.
Other researchers are considering whether GalSafe pigs can be sources of everything from heart valves to skin grafts for human patients.
The NYU kidney transplant experiment should pave the way for trials in patients with end-stage kidney failure, possibly in the next year or two, said Montgomery, himself a heart transplant recipient. Those trials might test the approach as a short-term solution for critically ill patients until a human kidney becomes available, or as a permanent graft.
The current experiment involved a single transplant, and the kidney was left in place for only three days, so any future trials are likely to uncover new barriers that will need to be overcome, Montgomery said. Participants would probably be patients with low odds of receiving a human kidney and a poor prognosis on dialysis.
“For a lot of those people, the mortality rate is as high as it is for some cancers, and we don’t think twice about using new drugs and doing new trials (in cancer patients) when it might give them a couple of months more of life,” Montgomery said.
The researchers worked with medical ethicists, and legal and religious experts to vet the concept before asking a family for temporary access to a brain-dead patient, Montgomery said.",Reuters,"Oct 21, 2021 1:48 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/who-says-cannot-cut-corners-approving-india-covaxin-shot/,WHO says it ‘cannot cut corners’ in approving India’s Covaxin shot,"The World Health Organization on Monday, October 18, asked for further data from India’s Bharat Biotech to consider the company’s request for an emergency-use listing for its COVID-19 shot, saying the WHO could not “cut corners” in making a decision.
Bharat Biotech, which developed Covaxin with an Indian state research body, started sharing data with the WHO from early July. The vaccine was given emergency use authorization in India in January even before the completion of a late-stage trial, which later found the shot to be 78% efficacious.
Without a WHO nod, the two-dose Covaxin is unlikely to be accepted as a valid vaccine around the world and would complicate travel plans for tens of millions of Indians who have taken it. Covaxin accounts for 11% of the 985.5 million total doses administered in India, and has also been exported.
“We are aware that many people are waiting for WHO’s recommendation for Covaxin to be included in the #COVID19 Emergency Use Listing, but we cannot cut corners,” the WHO said on Twitter.
“Before recommending a product for emergency use, we must evaluate it thoroughly to make sure it is safe and effective.”
The WHO was expecting “one additional piece of information from the company today,” it added, without specifying.
Bharat Biotech, which has struggled to meet production timelines for Covaxin, did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Sunday, October 17, its technical advisory group would meet on October 26 to consider the listing for Covaxin. He said the WHO’s goal was to “have a broad portfolio of vaccines approved for emergency use & to expand access to populations everywhere.”

Valneva said its latest trial which was conducted on 4,012 participants aged 18 years and older across 26 trial sites in Britain and showed the vaccine prompted a stronger immune response and fewer side-effects than AstraZeneca’s shot.
Valneva is among a handful of vaccine developers testing their vaccines against one that’s already been approved by a regulator rather than giving volunteers a dummy placebo as shots become more available.
“These results confirm the advantages often associated with inactivated whole virus vaccines,” said Valneva Chief Executive Thomas Lingelbach, adding that the company believed it would make an important contribution to the fight against COVID-19.
Valneva said it was preparing for trials in children aged 5-12 years and for a Valneva-sponsored trial to evaluate VLA2001’s performance for people in need of a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot.
The company’s shares plunged last month after Britain cancelled a contract for about 100 million doses of the vaccine Valneva was developing, partly over concerns about when it would win approval for use.

https://www.rappler.com/technology/features/girls-health-misinformation-coda-story/,Social media health myths are destroying the lives of teenage girls,"Ronja Holopainen didn’t mean to fall down the rabbit hole. But, like so many things online, it just happened. One day last spring, the 21-year-old medical student was scrolling through Instagram when she stumbled into the strange world of period misinformation.
Her journey started simply enough. Searching Instagram using the hashtags “period” and “menstruation,” she quickly came across a deluge of posts promoting unsubstantiated ideas, such as girls being able to regulate or predict periods based on their astrological signs. Visiting the accounts responsible for them appeared to populate her feed with even more falsehoods.
“When you get to one page, you start scrolling to the next and the next, and end up somewhere on the deep web,” she said.
The volume of distortions and inaccuracies shook Holopainen. So, she decided to meet them head-on. She was well-positioned to do so. For the past seven years, she has campaigned with the global girls’ rights organization Plan International. Bringing her experience of medicine and advocacy together, she set up an Instagram page — theperiodmove — to help girls climb out of the morass of pseudoscience that many of them have unwittingly stumbled into.
On May 1, she published her first post: a soft pink grid detailing how misinformation seeps into discussions about menstruation. “Due to the taboo nature of periods, a lot of mis- and disinformation is being spread,” she wrote. “This may cause false and even dangerous beliefs.”
It’s no secret that our digital spaces are rife with conspiracy theories and fake news. But new research from Plan International suggests that disinformation is taking a severe toll on young women and girls, exposing them to ideas that are dangerous to their physical wellbeing, eroding their trust in democratic processes and negatively affecting their mental health. The report comes amid increased scrutiny of social media’s influence on adolescents, following a series of damning allegations from a Facebook whistleblower about Instagram’s “toxic” impact on teenage girls, including exacerbating disordered eating and suicidal ideation.
Plan International’s study surveyed more than 26,000 girls across 26 countries about their exposure to disinformation and found significant numbers are harmed by online myths. In the United States, 80% of young women said misinformation has had a negative impact on their lives, while Brazil and the Philippines reported 91% and 95%, respectively. One-third reported that it has damaged their mental health, making them more stressed and anxious, and 20% said their faith in election results has been compromised.
The report also clearly showed that digital disinformation can affect the decisions that girls make about their physical health. For instance, a quarter of young women questioned whether to get vaccinated against the coronavirus. Like Holopainen, they also have also been confronted by a significant amount of erroneous health misinformation — one, in Brazil, recalled coming across a post suggesting that tampons cause cancer.
The flood of reproductive health-related misinformation has introduced Generation Z to a new variety of influencer: physicians debunking online misinformation about sexually transmitted diseases, fertility, the human papillomavirus vaccine, birth control and other reproductive health issues in snappy, bite-sized videos on TikTok and Instagram. But, for most doctors, myth-busting often takes place when they meet patients.
U.S.-based medical practitioners Trish Hutchison and Melisa Holmes routinely field an array of social media-driven questions on topics ranging from coronavirus vaccines to infertility. Hutchison, a physician who works at the College of Charleston in South Carolina,, and Holmes, an obstetrician-gynecologist in the state, also run an online sexual education hub for parents and teens called Girlology. This work has allowed them to see that what young women see on screen often migrates directly into their real-life choices and beliefs.
Falsehoods about menstrual products — such as the myth that non-organic tampons leak chemicals into girls’ bodies — are widespread. However, the most common lies that they find themselves patiently refuting are that the birth control pill causes infertility or that women need to periodically take a break from using contraception to “cleanse” their bodies. “The only thing that happens when you take a break from birth control is that you have an unintended pregnancy,” Holmes says.
They also routinely confront misconceptions about feminine hygiene, largely propagated by online vendors of pseudoscientific products claiming to promote vaginal cleanliness. “Self-treating vaginas is huge on Instagram,” Hutchison told me. “I pulled a sprig of lavender out of a vagina a couple of weeks ago, because TikTok talks about how to clean yourself. Don’t do that.”
Some social media channels lay heavy emphasis on self-treatment and diagnosis, leading them to delay visiting a doctor until their conditions are more advanced than they need to be. Holmes pointed to a patient who developed a kidney infection after attempting to self-treat a urinary tract infection with cranberry juice, or young women who gave themselves skin conditions after using DIY remedies to treat what they wrongly believed were yeast infections.
“There’s so much self-treatment that’s happening based on Dr. Google that people are later getting health care from a trusted and licensed provider,” Holmes said. “Someone may think they think they have a yeast infection and it’s not getting better and they’ve looked online. They come in finally and they’ve got raging herpes infection, and they didn’t recognize what it was. We are definitely seeing more misinformation and it’s impacting people in bigger ways than it used to.”",Erica Hellerstein,"Oct 17, 2021 4:00 PM PHT"

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/who-advises-additional-covid-19-shot-immunocompromised-people/,WHO advises additional COVID-19 shot for immunocompromised people,"The World Health Organization on Monday, October 11, recommended that immunocompromised people be given an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine, due to their higher risk of breakthrough infections after standard immunization.
The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization said the additional dose should be offered “as part of an extended primary series since these individuals are less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary vaccine series and are at high risk of severe COVID-19 disease”.
WHO vaccine director Kate O’Brien, referring to people with lower immunity due to other conditions, told a news briefing: “The recommendation is for a third vaccination, an additional vaccination in the primary series and again that is based on the evidence showing that the immunogenicity and evidence on breakthrough infections is highly disproportionately represented by those people.”
The panel also recommended that people over 60 receive an additional dose of the shots made by Chinese vaccine makers Sinopharm and Sinovac some one to three months after completing their schedule, citing evidence in studies in Latin America that they perform less well over time.
Observational data on Sinopharm and Sinovac shots “clearly showed that in older age groups … the vaccine performs less well after two doses”, said Joachim Hombach, secretary of the independent panel of experts who held a five-day closed-door meeting last week.
“We also know that the addition of a third dose or moving into a two-plus-one schedule provides a strong (immune) response. So we expect from there a much better protection,” he said.
Health authorities using the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines should aim first to maximize two-dose coverage in the older populations and then administer the third dose, the panel said.
The SAGE group, composed of independent experts who make policy but not regulatory recommendations, will review all global data on booster shots in a November 11 meeting, amid questions over variants and potential waning of immunity, O’Brien said.
Currently some 3.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered, O’Brien said.
An estimated 1.5 billion doses are available globally each month, enough to meet the target of vaccinating 40% of each country’s population by year-end, but distribution is unequal, she added.
“Giving those booster doses to individuals who have already had the benefit of a primary response is like putting two life jackets on somebody and leaving others without any lifejacket,” O’Brien said.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-vaccines-do-not-stay-body-years/,"No, COVID-19 vaccines don’t stay in your body for years","As Australia strives to reach its national COVID-19 vaccination targets, there’s unprecedented focus on the biological effects of vaccines.
While there’s an enormous amount of information available online, it’s increasingly difficult to discern truth from falsehood or even conspiracy.
A common myth of vaccines that has appeared in recent months is the accusation they remain active in the body for extended periods of time – a claim which has increased vaccine hesitancy in some people.
However, vaccines are cleared from your body in mere days or weeks. It’s the immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that appears to last for a long time.
This isn’t due to the vaccines themselves remaining in the body. Instead, the vaccines stimulate our immune system and teach it how to respond if we’re ever exposed to the coronavirus.
Let’s explain.
Covid vaccines show your body's natural defenses how to recognize and kill the virus, then they disappear. They don't stay with you, they don't change your DNA, and serious adverse effects from vaccination are extraordinarily rare.
All vaccines, no matter the technology, have the same fundamental goal – to introduce the immune system to an infectious agent, without the risk that comes from disease.
The vaccine needs to follow a similar pathway a virus would have taken to produce an adequate immune response. Viruses enter our cells and use them to replicate themselves. So, the vaccines also need to be delivered in cells where proteins are produced, which mimics a component of the virus itself.
The COVID-19 vaccines all do this by delivering information into our muscle cells, usually in our upper arm. They do this in different ways, such as using mRNA, like Pfizer’s and Moderna’s, or viral vectors, like AstraZeneca’s.
Regardless of the technology, the effect is similar. Our cells use the genetic template in the vaccine to produce the coronavirus’ spike protein, which is a part of the virus that helps it enter our cells. The spike protein is transported to the surface of the cell where it’s detected by the immune cells nearby.
There are also other specialized immune cells nearby, which take up the spike proteins and use them to inform more immune cells – targeting them specifically against COVID-19.
These immune cells include B cells, which produce antibodies, and T cells, which kill virus-infected cells. They then become long-lasting memory cells, which wait and monitor for the next time it sees a spike protein.
If you’re exposed to the virus, these memory B and T cells allow a faster and larger immune response, destroying the virus before it can cause disease.
Once they’ve initiated the immune response, the vaccines themselves are rapidly broken down and cleared from the body.
The mRNA vaccines consist of a fatty shell, which encapsulates a group of mRNA particles – the genetic recipe for the spike protein. Once this enters a cell, the shell is degraded to harmless fats, and the mRNA is used by the cells to produce spike proteins.
Once the mRNA has been used to produce proteins, it’s broken down and cleared from the cell along with the rest of the mRNAs produced by the normal function of the cell.
In fact, mRNA is very fragile, with the most long-lasting only able to survive for a few days. This is why the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have to be so carefully preserved at ultra-low temperatures.
The vector vaccines (AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson) use an adenovirus, which is harmless in humans, as a vector to deliver a genetic template for the spike protein to the cells.
The vector virus has all of its infectious components removed, so it’s unable to multiply or cause disease. Then a genetic template for the spike protein is inserted into the vector.
Once the vaccine is injected, the vector virus binds to your cells and inserts its genetic components, before the shell breaks down and is removed.
The viral machinery gets the genetic template into the control room of the cell, the nucleus, where it takes advantage of our normal protein-building activity. The vaccine doesn’t cause any alteration to our DNA.
Normally, this would cause the cell to start producing more copies of the virus, but since this was all removed, all that’s produced is the spike protein.
Again, after making a large amount of the spike, the genetic templates are broken down in a matter of days or weeks.
I’m having so many conversations about the concern that vaccines interfere with cells’ genetic material but no one seems freaked out that viruses jump right in there and make our cells little virus factories
While the vaccines themselves are rapidly removed, what then happens to all the spike proteins that are produced as a result?
They’re identified as foreign by the immune system and destroyed – teaching the cells to recognize the coronavirus in the process.
The spike proteins are fully cleared from the body after a few weeks. At this time, they don’t appear to leave the vaccination site (most often your upper arm).
But antibodies specifically targeting the spike protein produced by your immune system remain in the body for many months after vaccination.
The vaccines also stimulate your immune system to produce memory immune cells. This means even once antibody levels diminish, your immune system is ready to produce more antibodies and other immune cells to tackle the virus if you’re ever exposed to it. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/study-shows-anxiety-surged-during-pandemic-particularly-women/,"Anxiety surged during pandemic, particularly among women – study","The COVID-19 pandemic led to a surge in anxiety and major depressive disorders across the world, particularly among women and young people, a study published in The Lancet on Friday, October 9, found.
Young people suffered as school closures kept them away from friends, and many women found themselves bearing the brunt of household work and facing an increased risk of domestic violence, the researchers said.
The study, led by academics at the University of Queensland, Australia, recorded 76 million additional cases of anxiety disorders and 53 million of major depressive disorder as COVID-19 spread in 2020.
“Sadly, for numerous reasons, women were always more likely to be worse affected by the social and economic consequences of the pandemic,” study co-author Alize Ferrari said.
“Additional caring and household responsibilities tend to fall on women, and because women are more likely to be victims of domestic violence, which increased at various stages of the pandemic.”
School closures and other curbs limited “young people’s ability to learn and interact with their peers,” she added.
The research included 48 previously conducted studies from around the world, and pulled together their findings in a meta-analysis to quantify the prevalence of mental health disorders in 204 countries and territories in 2020.
That made it “the first global insight into the burden of depressive and anxiety disorders during the pandemic,” the authors of a linked comment piece who were not involved in the study said.
It found there was an estimated 28% increase in cases of major depressive disorder, to 246 million cases, up from an estimated 193 million cases had the pandemic not happened.
There was a similar 26% increase in estimated cases of anxiety, with an estimated 374 million cases compared to 298 million without the pandemic.
The authors of the study warned that there was a lack of high-quality data on the impact of the pandemic on mental health in many poorer countries, adding extrapolated estimates for those countries should be interpreted with caution.",Reuters,"Oct 9, 2021 4:08 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-vaccines-how-speed-up-rollout-poorer-countries/,COVID-19 vaccines: How to speed up rollout in poorer countries,"COVID-19 vaccine production has scaled up significantly. Global output is now estimated to be over 1.5 billion doses a month, rapidly propelling the world towards the 11.3 billion doses needed to vaccinate 80% of teenagers and adults and potentially bring the pandemic to an end. Total output may reach that target by the end of 2021.
Protecting the global population will soon no longer be hampered by limited supply. Yet despite production scaling up, for many low- and middle-income countries, access to vaccines continues to be a struggle. Poorer countries lag far behind richer ones in terms of COVID-19 vaccine coverage. Fewer than 3% of people in low-income countries are fully vaccinated.
As the world closes in on having the capacity to theoretically vaccinate everyone, more needs to be done to make sure doses end up being given to those that need them. Here’s what’s standing in the way.
Part of the problem is that production is concentrated in relatively few countries. Pretty much everyone imports COVID-19 vaccines, but 80% of exports come from just ten countries, and low- and middle-income countries are barely present in COVID-19 vaccine supply chains. As a result, they don’t have ready access to supplies that they themselves are creating, while when trying to secure imports, they tend to be outcompeted by wealthier countries, who typically over-order.
One way vaccine producers are trying to resolve this problem is by diversifying who makes vaccines. AstraZeneca, for example, is working with Siam Bioscience in Thailand to produce vaccines in South-east Asia that are specifically for the region. Johnson & Johnson is working with Aspen PharmaCare in South Africa to increase supply to Africa.
Other countries are becoming producers too. Vietnamese manufacturers are going to make Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. And Egypt has signed a deal that could see it produce a billion doses of the Sinovac vaccine each year, many of which would be used to supply Africa.
An added benefit of these agreements is that they produce vaccines closer to where they are needed. Stretched supply chains are causing issues around the globe, and medical supply chains have been under pressure throughout the pandemic. Shortening supply chains should hopefully leave low- and middle-income countries less exposed to shortages and pressures elsewhere in the world.
There have also been calls for a patent waiver for COVID-19 vaccines, to legally allow countries to produce doses of the existing vaccines without the involvement of the pharmaceutical companies that developed them. But calls for this so far haven’t been successful.
A vaccine patent waiver also wouldn’t solve access issues on its own. For low-income countries to produce their own doses, technology and knowledge would need to be passed over along with the legal production rights. Financial support would be needed too. At the time of writing, vaccine producers are yet to share freely the knowledge behind their products.
Transport also needs to be addressed. The logistics of rolling out COVID-19 vaccines in low- and middle-income settings can be very challenging.
Roads to remote communities can be non-existent, dangerous or in a bad state of repair. In Indonesia, for example, authorities have found it hard to get doses to certain island communities. But these challenges can be overcome. In Bhutan, vaccines have got to hard-to-reach mountainous locations by air or on foot. Countries like Malawi and Vanuatu have tested delivering vaccines using drones. Good planning and ingenuity can boost delivery rates.
Meanwhile keeping COVID-19 vaccines at their required temperatures in transit and in warehouses is a particular concern. But this isn’t new. The Ebola vaccine also needs to be stored at ultra-low temperatures and has been successfully distributed to areas like the DRC’s conflict-affected north-eastern region. This experience of combating disease outbreaks should be beneficial in setting up the necessary logistics this time round.
Ultimately, people need to be willing to be vaccinated. They also need people and facilities to administer vaccines to them. There are, however, significant shortages of healthcare workers around the world, with low- and middle-income countries particularly badly affected.
Staff need to be specially trained to give COVID-19 vaccinations, which is why the World Health Organization offers online training for frontline staff in a wide range of languages. Local knowledge is also essential for setting up vaccination points that correspond to the needs of the population – there’s no point offering vaccines where people can’t or don’t want to have them.
Hesitancy is also a barrier in some places – for instance in the east African countries of Uganda and Tanzania. Consistent messaging is needed to overcome it, and authorities need to engage with the public on their specific concerns, which may be linked to religious or cultural factors or fears around safety. Lessons learned in one country are unlikely to be directly transferable to others, but can inform the development effective strategies.
There is extreme inequity in access to COVID-19 vaccines – and the pandemic won’t end until it’s addressed. Only 2.3% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose. In the UK, that figure is close to 90%. There is a moral imperative to change this, and an economic one too. Global trade cannot properly recover until the virus is suppressed.
Ending the pandemic will mean making more doses available to lower-income countries. It will require getting better at delivering vaccines in difficult-to-reach parts of the world. And it will mean ensuring that people in lower-income countries want to get vaccinated. As vaccine production continues to ratchet up, it’s important to remember that all three of these points need to be addressed. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-drops-after-months/,Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness drops after 6 months – study,"The effectiveness of the Pfizer Inc /BioNTech SE vaccine in preventing infection by the coronavirus dropped to 47% from 88% six months after the second dose, according to data published on Monday that US health agencies considered when deciding on the need for booster shots.
The data, which was published in The Lancet medical journal, had been previously released in August ahead of peer review.
The analysis showed that the vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing hospitalization and death remained high at 90% for at least six months, even against the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus.
The data suggests that the drop is due to waning efficacy, rather than more contagious variants, researchers said.
Researchers from Pfizer and Kaiser Permanente studied electronic health records of roughly 3.4 million people who were members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California between December 2020 – when the vaccine first became available – and August of 2021.
“Our variant-specific analysis clearly shows that the (Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccine is effective against all current variants of concern, including Delta,” said Luis Jodar, senior vice president and chief medical officer at Pfizer vaccines.
A potential limitation of the study was a lack of data on adherence to masking guidelines and occupations in the study population, which could have affected frequency of testing and likelihood of exposure to the virus.
Vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant was 93% after the first month, declining to 53% after four months. Against other coronavirus variants, efficacy declined to 67% from 97%.
“To us, that suggests Delta is not an escape variant that is completely evading vaccine protection,” said study leader Sara Tartof with Kaiser Permanente Southern California’s Department of Research & Evaluation.
“If it was, we would probably not have seen high protection after vaccination, because vaccination would not be working in that case. It would start low, and stay low.”
Testing for variants is more likely to fail in vaccinated individuals, which could lead to overestimation of variant-specific effectiveness in the study, the authors cautioned.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/thailand-talks-merck-covid-19-treatment-molnupiravir-pills/,"Thailand in talks with Merck for 200,000 courses of pill for COVID-19 treatment","Thailand’s government is in talks with US drugmaker Merck & Co to purchase 200,000 courses of the company’s experimental antiviral pill for COVID-19 treatment, a Thai official said on Monday, October 4.
Many Asian countries are scrambling to lock in supplies of the potential treatment early after they lagged behind Western nations in COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, hit by tight supplies.
South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia said they are all in talks to buy Merck’s potential treatment, while the Philippines, which is running a trial on the pill, said it hopes its domestic study would allow access to the treatment.
They all declined to provide details on purchase negotiations.
Somsak Akksilp, director-general of the Department of Medical Services, told Reuters that Thailand is currently working on a purchasing agreement for the antiviral drug, known as molnupiravir.
The molnupiravir pills, designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus, would be the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19.
Interim clinical trials indicated it could reduce by around 50% the chance of hospitalization or death for patients at risk of severe disease from COVID-19.
“We are now working on a purchasing agreement with Merck that is expected to be completed by this week… we have pre-booked 200,000 courses,” Somsak said. He said the pills could arrive as soon as December, though the deal would be subject to the pills’ approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Thai regulator.
Representatives at Merck’s Thailand office were not immediately reachable.
Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Thailand fell below 10,000 on Monday for the first time since mid-July. The country has administered 55.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines so far, fully inoculating about 31% of the population.
Merck has said it expects to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of 2021. It has a US government contract to supply 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir at a price of $700 per course.
The company has said it plans a tiered pricing approach based on country income criteria.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/winners-nobel-prize-medicine-2021/,2 Americans win Medicine Nobel Prize for sensory findings,"American scientists David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian won the 2021 Nobel Prize for Medicine on Monday, October 4, for discoveries of receptors for temperature and touch which the award-giving body said could pave the way for new painkillers.
Their findings “have allowed us to understand how heat, cold and mechanical force can initiate the nerve impulses that allow us to perceive and adapt to the world around us,” the Nobel Assembly at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute said.
“This knowledge is being used to develop treatments for a wide range of disease conditions, including chronic pain.”
The breakthrough discoveries, achieved independently of one another, had launched intense research activities that had led to “a rapid increase in our understanding of how our nervous system senses heat, cold and mechanical stimuli,” it said.
The more than century-old prize is worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.15 million).
The prestigious Nobel prizes, for achievements in science, literature and peace, were created and funded in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel. They have been awarded since 1901, with the economics prize first handed out in 1969.
The Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, shared in equal parts this year by the two laureates, often lives in the shadow of the Nobels for literature and peace, and their sometimes more widely known recipients.
But medicine has been thrust into the spotlight by the COVID-19 pandemic, and some scientists had suggested those who developed coronavirus vaccines could be rewarded this year or in coming years.
The 2021 laureates were caught off guard, according to the committee.
“They were incredibly happy and as far as I could tell very surprised and a little bit shocked,” said Professor Thomas Perlmann, Secretary-General for the Nobel Assembly and the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine.
The pandemic continues to haunt the Nobel ceremonies, which are usually full of old-world pomp and glamor. The banquet in Stockholm has been postponed for a second successive year amid lingering worries about the virus and international travel.
Patapoutian, who was born in 1967 to Armenian parents in Lebanon and moved to Los Angeles in his youth, is a Professor at Scripps Research, La Jolla, California, having previously done research at the University of California, San Francisco, and California Institute of Technology, Pasadena.
He is credited for finding the cellular mechanism and the underlying gene that translates a mechanical force on our skin into an electric nerve signal.

The data also indicated heart inflammation occurs more often in adolescents and adults under 30 years of age, and more often in males.
The statement from the Public Health Agency of Canada said majority of the affected individuals experienced relatively mild illness and recovered quickly.
The risk of cardiac complications, including heart inflammation, has been shown to be substantially increased following COVID-19 infections, with the risks higher after the infection than after vaccination, according to the statement.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/merck-pill-breakthrough-raises-hopes-preventing-covid-19-deaths/,Merck pill breakthrough raises hopes of preventing COVID-19 deaths,"An experimental antiviral pill developed by Merck & Co could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalized for those most at risk of contracting severe COVID-19, according to data that experts hailed as a potential breakthrough in how the virus is treated.
If it gets authorization, molnupiravir, which is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus, would be the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19.
Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said they plan to seek US emergency use authorization for the pill as soon as possible and to make regulatory applications worldwide.
“An oral antiviral that can impact hospitalization risk to such a degree would be game-changing,” Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said.
Current treatment options include Gilead Sciences Inc’s antiviral remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone, although both are generally only given once a patient has already been hospitalized.
“This is going to change the dialogue around how to manage COVID-19,” Merck Chief Executive Robert Davis told Reuters.
Existing treatments are “cumbersome and logistically challenging to administer. A simple oral pill would be the opposite of that,” Adalja added.
The results from the Phase 3 trial, which sent Merck shares up more than 9%, were so strong that the study is being stopped early at the recommendation of outside monitors.
Shares of Atea Pharmaceuticals Inc, which is developing a similar COVID-19 treatment, were up more than 21% on the news.
Shares of COVID-19 vaccine makers Moderna Inc were off more than 10%, while Pfizer was down less than 1%.
Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said investors believe “people will be less afraid of COVID and less inclined to get vaccines if there is a simple pill that can treat COVID.”
Pfizer and Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG are also racing to develop an easy-to-administer antiviral pill for COVID-19. For now, only antibody cocktails that have to be given intravenously are approved for non-hospitalized patients.
White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said on Friday that molnupiravir is “a potential additional tool… to protect people from the worst outcomes of COVID,” but added that vaccination “remains far and away, our best tool against COVID-19.”
A planned interim analysis of 775 patients in Merck’s study looked at hospitalizations or deaths among people at risk for severe disease. It found that 7.3% of those given molnupiravir twice a day for five days were hospitalized and none had died by 29 days after treatment. That compared with a hospitalization rate of 14.1% for placebo patients. There were also eight deaths in the placebo group.
“Antiviral treatments that can be taken at home to keep people with COVID-19 out of the hospital are critically needed,” Wendy Holman, Ridgeback’s CEO, said in a statement.
Scientists welcomed the potential new treatment to help prevent serious illness from the virus, which has killed almost 5 million people around the world.
“A safe, affordable, and effective oral antiviral would be a huge advance in the fight against COVID,” said Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the University of Oxford.
The study enrolled patients with laboratory-confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19, who had symptoms for no more than five days. All patients had at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcome, such as obesity or older age.
Merck said viral sequencing done so far shows molnupiravir is effective against all variants of the coronavirus, including highly transmissible Delta, which has driven the recent worldwide surge in hospitalizations and deaths.
It said rates of adverse events were similar for both molnupiravir and placebo patients, but did not give details.
Merck has said data shows molnupiravir is not capable of inducing genetic changes in human cells, but men enrolled in its trials have to abstain from heterosexual intercourse or agree to use contraception. Women of child-bearing age cannot be pregnant and also have to use birth control.
The US drugmaker said it expects to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of 2021, with more coming next year.
The company has a US government contract to supply 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir at a price of $700 per course.
Davis said Merck has similar agreements with other governments, and is in talks with more. Merck said it plans a tiered pricing approach based on country income criteria.
The US government has the option to purchase up to an additional 3.5 million treatment courses if needed, a US health official told Reuters. The official asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to comment publicly on the contract.
Merck has also agreed to license the drug to several India-based generic drugmakers, which would be able to supply the treatment to low- and middle-income countries.
Molnupiravir is also being studied in a Phase 3 trial for preventing coronavirus infection in people exposed to the virus.
Merck officials said it is unclear how long the FDA review will take, although Dean Li, head of Merck’s research labs, said “They are going to try to work with alacrity on this.”",Reuters,"Oct 1, 2021 11:33 PM PHT"

The European Medicines Agency also recommended that immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a bleeding disorder caused by the body mistakenly attacking platelets, be added as an adverse reaction with an unknown frequency to the J&J vaccine product information and to AstraZeneca’s vaccine.
J&J said while the chances of experiencing these conditions were very low, the product information would be updated accordingly as it continues to work closely with authorities including EMA.
“We strongly support raising awareness of the signs and symptoms of rare events to ensure they can be quickly identified and effectively treated,” the company said.
Both the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines have previously been associated with a very rare combination of blood clotting and low platelet counts known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).
The two products are based on harmless vector viruses that instruct human cells to make a protein that primes the immune system against future coronavirus infections.
EMA said the new, possibly life-threatening clotting condition known as venous thromboembolism (VTE) to be included on the J&J product label was separate from TTS.
VTE typically begins by a clot forming in a vein of a leg, arm or groin, which then travels to the lungs and blocks the blood supply there.
Regardless of any vaccine use, VTE is most commonly caused by injury or lack of movement in bedridden patients. Birth control pills and a number of chronic conditions are also seen as risk factors.",Reuters,"Oct 1, 2021 10:51 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-takeda-human-error-caused-contamination-moderna-vaccines/,Japan’s Takeda says ‘human error’ caused contamination of Moderna vaccines,"Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd said on Friday, October 1, that “human error” caused metal contaminants to get into Moderna COVID-19 vaccine doses, leading to a recall.
Takeda, which imports and distributes the vaccine in Japan, and Moderna said in a new report that a Spanish manufacturer discovered contaminants in some vials in July, but supplies from the same production were allowed to be shipped to Japan.
Japanese authorities in August suspended the use of three batches of Moderna shots containing 1.63 million doses after being notified of the contamination. Moderna conducted an investigation in partnership with Takeda and Spanish manufacturer Rovi, which operates the plant where the contamination occurred.
The new report said that the problem stemmed from “incorrect assembly and was due to human error specific to visually misjudging the required 1mm gap between the star-wheel and the stopper” of machinery that put the tops on vaccine vials.
A total of five, sequential lots of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine manufactured at Rovi between June 27 and July 3 were investigated. The first three were shipped to Japan and later recalled after the discovery of particles, later determined to be stainless steel, inside 39 vials.
But a fourth lot failed inspection after the discovery of particles on July 2, and a fifth lot was also held back by Rovi. The problems with Lots 4 and 5 were reported to Moderna, Takeda and Japan’s health ministry, but the first three lots were released for use because they “had passed inspection and were not considered to be impacted.”
In fact the incorrect set-up “led to the issue persisting throughout the series of five batches,” the investigation showed.
Improved operating procedures and the use of a new precision tool will help prevent the issue from recurring, the report said.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/merck-says-research-shows-covid-19-pill-works-against-variants/,Merck says research shows its COVID-19 pill works against variants,"Laboratory studies show that Merck & Co’s experimental oral COVID-19 antiviral drug, molnupiravir, is likely to be effective against known variants of the coronavirus, including the dominant, highly transmissible Delta, the company said on Wednesday, September 29.
Since molnupiravir does not target the spike protein of the virus – the target of all current COVID-19 vaccines – which defines the differences between the variants, the drug should be equally effective as the virus continues to evolve, said Jay Grobler, head of infectious disease and vaccines at Merck.
Molnupiravir instead targets the viral polymerase, an enzyme needed for the virus to make copies of itself. It is designed to work by introducing errors into the genetic code of the virus.
Data shows that the drug is most effective when given early in the course of infection, Merck said.
The US drugmaker tested its antiviral against nasal swab samples taken from participants in early trials of the drug. Delta was not in wide circulation at the time of those trials, but molnupiravir was tested against lab samples of the variant behind the latest surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.
Merck said earlier this year that a small, mid-stage trial found that after five days of molnupiravir treatment, none of the patients taking various doses of the drug tested positive for infectious virus, while 24% of placebo patients did have detectable levels.
Merck is currently conducting two Phase III trials of the antiviral it is developing with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics – one for treatment of COVID-19 and another as a preventive.
Merck anticipates that the Phase III treatment study will finish in early November, Grobler said.
The trial enrolled nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients who have had symptoms for no more than five days and are at risk for severe disease.
The latest analysis was presented during IDWeek, the annual meeting of infectious disease organizations, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/sanofi-reports-positive-results-potential-mrna-covid-19-vaccine/,Sanofi ditches mRNA COVID-19 vaccine amid rivals’ success,"Sanofi is dropping plans for its own mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine because of the dominant role of the BioNTech-Pfizer alliance as well as Moderna in the fight against the pandemic, the company said on Tuesday, September 28.
The move highlights the challenges of competing in particular with pioneer BioNTech, which rose from obscurity through its alliance with pharma major Pfizer last year. The pair have delivered close to 1.5 billion doses so far, making them the western world’s largest COVID-19 vaccine maker.
French healthcare group Sanofi will instead focus on efforts with British partner GlaxoSmithKline to bring another COVID-19 vaccine candidate to market based on the more conventional protein-based approach, where mass trials are ongoing.
The decision to drop clinical development of the mRNA shot, acquired as part of its takeover of Translate Bio, came despite positive Phase I/II study interim results announced on Tuesday where participants’ blood readings showed a strong immune reaction.
But Sanofi said the read-out encouraged it only to pursue the technology as a potential vaccine against influenza and other diseases, giving up on the area of COVID-19 because of the strong market presence of the two approved mRNA shots.
“These results will clearly help inform the path forward for our mRNA development programs,” said Jean-Francois Toussaint, global head of research and development at Sanofi Pasteur.
The company said it started testing an mRNA shot against seasonal influenza in humans in June and will launch follow-on clinical studies next year.
German biotech firm CureVac earlier this month also acknowledged rivals’ dominance when it cancelled some of the contract manufacturing deals for its experimental mRNA COVID-19 vaccine with two prospective partners.
CureVac’s product is under review by the European Union’s drugs regulator with an uncertain outcome after disappointing trial results.
The mRNA vaccines trick the human body into producing proteins known as antigens that are found on the surface of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That primes the immune system to quell future infections.
Under the more traditional protein-based vaccine approach that Sanofi will now focus on, the antigen is bioengineered in labs and combined with an efficacy booster known as adjuvant, provided by GSK.

Life expectancy fell by more than six months compared with 2019 in 22 of the 29 countries analyzed in the study, which spanned Europe, the United States, and Chile. There were reductions in life expectancy in 27 of the 29 countries overall.
The university said most life expectancy reductions across different countries could be linked to official COVID-19 deaths. There have been nearly five million reported deaths caused by the new coronavirus so far, a Reuters tally shows.
“The fact that our results highlight such a large impact that is directly attributable to COVID-19 shows how devastating a shock it has been for many countries,” said Dr Ridhi Kashyap, co-lead author of the paper, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology.
There were greater drops in life expectancy for men than women in most countries, with the largest decline in American men, who saw life expectancy drop by 2.2 years relative to 2019.
Overall, men had more than a year shaved off in 15 countries, compared to women in 11 countries. That wiped out the progress on mortality that had been made in the previous 5.6 years.
In the United States, the rise in mortality was mainly among those of working age and those under 60, while in Europe, deaths among people aged over 60 contributed more significantly to the increase in mortality.
Kashyap appealed to more countries, including low- and middle-income nations, to make mortality data available for further studies.

The latest data is a boost to the Chinese firm, whose COVID-19 vaccine has been under growing scrutiny over its effectiveness following reports of infections among healthcare workers fully immunized with the Sinovac shot in Indonesia and Thailand.
The study, conducted by the Malaysian government, found that 0.011% of about 7.2 million recipients of the Sinovac shot required treatment in intensive care units (ICU) for COVID-19 infections, health officials told reporters on Thursday, September 23.
By contrast, 0.002% of about 6.5 million recipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine needed ICU treatment for COVID-19 infections, while 0.001% of 744,958 recipients of the AstraZeneca shot required similar treatment.
Kalaiarasu Peariasamy, a director at the Institute for Clinical Research that conducted the study along with a national COVID-19 taskforce, said vaccinations – regardless of the brand – have reduced the risk of admission to intensive care by 83% and lowered the risk of death by 88% based on a smaller study involving about 1.26 million people.
“The breakthrough rate for intensive care unit admission is extremely low,” he said, adding overall ICU admissions among fully vaccinated individuals stood at 0.0066%.
The Mortality rate of fully vaccinated people was also low at 0.01% and the majority of them were either above 60 years of age or with comorbidities.
There were differences in the demographics of the recipients of the three vaccines and it could have resulted in the different results, Kalaiarasu said.
Many of AstraZeneca recipients were in the “mid-adulthood age”, while the Pfizer and Sinovac shots were “very much for the vulnerable population,” he said.
AstraZeneca recipients also accounted for a much smaller proportion of the study, which involved about 14.5 million fully vaccinated individuals and conducted for more than five months since April 1.
In July, Malaysia said it will stop administering the Sinovac vaccine once its supplies end, as it has a sufficient number of other vaccines for its program.
The Sinovac vaccine has been widely used in several countries including China, Indonesia, Thailand and Brazil, and the company said earlier this month it had supplied 1.8 billion doses at home and abroad.

The treatment has been granted US emergency use authorization, having gained attention when used to treat former President Donald Trump’s COVID-19 illness last year. Europe is reviewing the therapy, while Britain approved it last month.
While acknowledging costs associated with the treatment, the WHO panel said that given the recorded benefits of the therapy, “the recommendations should provide a stimulus to engage all possible mechanisms to improve global access to the intervention and associated testing.”
In a separate statement, the WHO called on Regeneron to lower prices and distribute the treatment equitably worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The agency also urged the firms to transfer tech to help make biosimilars.
The treatment, called Ronapreve, or REGEN-COV in the United States, has been a big earner for Regeneron, logging in US sales of $2.59 billion in the second quarter.
Regeneron is going to supply 1.4 million additional doses of REGEN-COV to the US government by January 31 at a cost of $2,100 per dose.
French medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) echoed the UN agency’s comments, demanding that affordable and sustainable access to life-saving drugs during the pandemic must be ensured.
The WHO guidelines, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), were based on data from a large British study and three other trials that have not yet been peer reviewed.
In June, Britain’s RECOVERY trial found the therapy reduced deaths in hospitalized patients whose own immune systems had failed to produce a response.

Novavax has been prioritizing regulatory submissions to low- and middle-income countries after falling behind in the race for authorization in the United States and Europe, which have already vaccinated most of their residents.
A WHO listing would allow Novavax to ship to multiple developing nations that rely on WHO guidance for their regulatory decisions.
It would also allow Novavax to begin distributing shots through the COVAX facility, which aims to provide equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for low- and middle-income countries.
Novavax has already submitted regulatory documents to countries including India, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
Novavax shares were up more than 10% in morning trading following the announcement.
Novavax and India’s Serum Institute, the world’s largest vaccine producer, have together committed to providing more than 1.1 billion doses to the COVAX facility.
COVAX has distributed fewer than 300 million shots to poorer nations, a fraction of the roughly 6 billion shots experts say are needed.
The United States earlier this week said it was committing an additional 500 million vaccines made by Pfizer Inc to COVAX, bringing its total contribution to more than 1 billion shots.
Novavax had previously said it would apply for WHO authorization in August, marking a slight delay in the filing. It expects to file for regulatory authorization in the United States and European Union in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine production ramp-up has been fraught with delays and it is unclear how many Novavax shots will be available for the COVAX facility this year. Novavax said in August it was aiming to produce 100 million shots monthly by the end of the third quarter.
The Novavax shot is a protein-based vaccine, and was shown to be more than 90% effective, including against a variety of concerning variants of the coronavirus in a large, late-stage US-based clinical trial.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/new-who-air-quality-guidelines-aim-cut-deaths-linked-fossil-fuels/,New WHO air-quality guidelines aim to cut deaths linked to fossil fuels,"The World Health Organization (WHO) tightened its air quality guidelines on Wednesday, September 22, for the first time since 2005, hoping to spur countries toward clean energy and prevent deaths and illness caused by air pollution.
The new recommendations targeting pollutants including particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, both of which are found in fossil fuel emissions, could save “millions of lives,” it said.
Air pollution kills at least seven million people prematurely each year. Even at very low levels, research has shown “air pollution affects all parts of the body, from the brain to a growing baby in a mother’s womb,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference.
The United Nations body hopes the revisions encourage their 194 member countries toward actions that slash fossil fuel emissions, which are also driving climate change. Globally, countries are under pressure to pledge bold emissions-cutting plans ahead of the UN climate conference in November in Glasgow, Scotland.
Scientists applauded the new guidelines, but worried that some countries would have trouble implementing them, given that much of the world was failing to meet the older, less stringent standards.
In 2019, a full 90% of the global population was breathing air considered unhealthy by the 2005 guidelines, according to WHO data. And some countries, such as India, still have national standards that are looser than those 2005 recommendations.
In the European Union, which has standards that are significantly higher than the WHO’s older recommendations, some countries failed to keep average annual pollution levels within legal limits in 2020, even with the industry and transportation shutdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Experts said that efforts to curb pollution by reducing fossil fuel use would provide a double benefit, in both improving public health conditions and bringing down climate-warming emissions.
“The two go hand in hand,” said Kurt Straif, a former scientist with the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer, who is a visiting professor and co-director of the Global Observatory on Pollution at Boston College. “While implementation is extremely challenging, it is also a once-in-a-generation opportunity in the post-COVID recovery.”
The new recommendations slash in half the WHO limits for a measure called PM2.5, which stands for particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers – or less than one-thirtieth the width of a human hair. That is small enough to travel deep into the lungs and even enter the blood stream.
According to the new limits, average annual PM2.5 concentrations should be no higher than 5 micrograms per cubic meter.
The old recommendations set the average annual limit at 10. But scientists have determined that long-term exposure to concentrations even that low still contributed to heart and lung diseases, stroke, and other negative health impacts.
Hardest hit are those living in low- and middle-income countries reliant on burning fossil fuels for electricity.
“The evidence is pretty clear that poorer populations and more socially disadvantaged populations are going to be more exposed, just because of where they are living,” said Jonathan Grigg, a paediatrician and researcher at Queen Mary University of London. Generally, he said, these groups emit less pollution, yet face more of its consequences.
Meeting the new guidelines would not only improve overall health, but could work to reduce health inequality, he said.
In announcing the new guidelines, the WHO said that “almost 80% of deaths related to PM2.5 could be avoided in the world if the current air pollution levels were reduced.”
The average PM2.5 level in China in the first half of this year was 34 micrograms per cubic meter. For Beijing, the level was 41, the same as last year.
“What matters most is whether governments implement impactful policies to reduce pollutant emissions, such as ending investments in coal, oil and gas and prioritizing the transition to clean energy,” said Aidan Farrow, a Greenpeace international air pollution scientist who is based at Britain’s University of Exeter.

India, the world’s biggest maker of vaccines, stopped exports of COVID shots in April to focus on inoculating its own population as infections exploded.
The country’s monthly vaccine output has since more than doubled and is set to quadruple to over 300 million doses next month, minister Mansukh Mandaviya said, adding that only excess supplies would be exported.
Total production could top 1 billion in the last three months of the year as new vaccines from companies such as Biological E are likely to be approved, he said.
“We will help other countries and also fulfil our responsibility towards COVAX,” he told reporters.
Reuters reported last week that India was considering restarting exports of COVID-19 vaccines soon. It donated or sold 66 million doses to nearly 100 countries before the export halt.
The announcement on resumption of exports in the October to December quarter comes ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington this week where vaccines are likely to be discussed at a summit of the leaders of the Quad countries – the United States, India, Japan and Australia.
India wants to vaccinate all its 944 million adults by December and has so far given at least one dose to 64% of them and two doses to 22%.
India’s inoculations have jumped since last month, especially as the world’s biggest vaccine maker, the Serum Institute of India, has more than trebled its output of the AstraZeneca shot to 200 million doses a month from April levels.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/are-covid-19-boosters-ethical-half-world-waiting-first-shot/,"Are COVID-19 boosters ethical, with half the world waiting for a first shot?","Should countries that can afford COVID-19 booster vaccines offer them to residents if scientists recommend them?
The director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has made his position clear, calling for countries to impose a moratorium on boosters until 10% of people in every country are vaccinated. His plea comes amid mounting concerns about the slow progress getting COVID-19 vaccines to people in low-income countries.
Like the WHO, some ethicists, including me, have argued that the world must stand together in solidarity to end the pandemic.
Yet as of September 14, of the 5.76 billion doses of vaccine that have been administered globally, only 1.9% went to people in low-income countries.
Meanwhile, many wealthy countries have begun offering COVID-19 boosters to fully vaccinated, healthy adults.
Early evidence on the benefit of COVID-19 boosters to protect against severe disease and death cuts both ways. Some experts tout their benefits, while others argue against them for now.
As a philosopher who studies justice and global bioethics, I believe everyone needs to wrestle with another question: the ethics of whether to offer boosters while people in poor countries go without.
The WHO’s call for a moratorium on boosters is an appeal to fairness: the idea that it’s unfair for richer countries to use up more of the global vaccine supply while 58% of people in the world have not received their first shots.
In some countries, such as Tanzania, Chad, and Haiti, fewer than 1% of people have received a vaccine. Meanwhile, in wealthy nations, most citizens are fully vaccinated – 79% of people in the United Arab Emirates, 76% in Spain, 65% in the UK, and 53% in the US.
In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended boosters for moderately to severely immunocompromised people. President Biden has publicly endorsed offering boosters to all Americans eight months after they complete their second shots, pending Food and Drug Administration approval. Yet on September 17, the FDA’s advisory panel recommended against a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine for most Americans, though they did endorse boosters for people over age 65 or at higher risk.
On August 11, before the CDC had authorized boosters for anyone – including immunocompromised people – it estimated  that 1 million Americans had decided not to wait and got a third vaccine. It is unclear whether some of them were advised by doctors to seek a booster shot based on, for example, age or compromised immunity. Some healthy Americans have reportedly lied to gain access to unauthorized shots, telling pharmacists – falsely – that this is their first shot.
In addition to raising concerns about fairness, gross disparities between vaccine haves and have-nots violate an ethical principle of health equity. This principle holds that the world ought to help those who are most in need – people in low-income countries who cannot access a single dose.
There’s also a purely utilitarian case to be made for delaying boosters. Even if boosters save lives and prevent severe disease, they benefit people far less than first shots, a notion known as diminishing marginal utility.
For example, the original laboratory studies of the Pfizer vaccine showed more than 90% protection for most people against severe disease and death after the primary, two-dose series. Booster shots, even if they boost immunity, give much less protection: perhaps less than 10% protection, according to a preliminary study.
As a recent article in a leading medical journal, The Lancet, points out, “Even if boosting were eventually shown to decrease the medium-term risk of serious disease, current vaccine supplies could save more lives if used in previously unvaccinated populations than if used as boosters in vaccinated populations.”
Moreover, when scarce vaccines are used as boosters, rather than as first shots for the unvaccinated, that allows the virus to replicate and mutate, potentially creating variants of concern that undercut vaccine protection.
While the ethical argument for delaying boosters is strong, critics think it is not strong enough to override every nation’s duty to protect its own people. According to one interpretation of this view, countries should adopt an “influenza standard.” In other words, governments are justified in prioritizing their own residents until the risks of COVID-19 are similar to the flu season’s. At that point, governments should send vaccine supplies to countries with greater needs.
One could argue that since rich countries have bought millions of doses, they are the rightful owners of those vaccines and are ethically free to do as they wish.
Yet critics argue that vaccines are not owned by anyone, even by the pharmaceutical companies that develop them. Instead, they represent the final part of product development that is years in the making and the result of many people’s labors. Moreover, most COVID-19 vaccines were publicly funded, principally by governments using taxpayer dollars.
Since 1995, the World Trade Organization has required its member states to enforce intellectual property rights, including patents for vaccines. Currently, however, the trade organization’s members are debating proposals to temporarily waive patents on COVID-19-related products during the pandemic.
Some commentators suggest that the whole debate over boosters is overblown and not really about ethics at all. They propose simply calling boosters something else: “final doses.”
But regardless of what we call boosters, the ethical question the WHO’s director-general raised remains: Is giving these shots a fair and equitable way to distribute a lifesaving vaccine? – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/scientists-singapore-transform-fruit-leftovers-antibacterial-bandages/,Scientists in Singapore transform fruit leftovers into antibacterial bandages,"Scientists at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore are tackling food waste by turning discarded durian husks into antibacterial gel bandages.
The process extracts cellulose powder from the fruit’s husks after they are sliced and freeze-dried, then mixes it with glycerol. This mixture becomes soft hydrogel, which is then cut into bandage strips.
“In Singapore, we consume about 12 million durians a year, so besides the flesh, we can’t do much about the husk and the seeds and this cause environmental pollution,” said Professor William Chen, director of the food science and technology program at NTU. The fruit’s husks, which make up more than half of the composition of durians, are usually discarded and incinerated, contributing to environmental waste.
Chen added that the technology can also turn other food waste, such as soy beans and spent grains, into hydrogel, helping limit the country’s food waste.
Compared to conventional bandages, the organo-hydrogel bandages are also able to keep wound areas cooler and moist, which can help accelerate healing.
The researchers say using waste materials and yeast for the antimicrobial bandages is more cost effective than the production of conventional bandages, whose antimicrobial properties come from more expensive metallic compounds like silver or copper ions.
A durian wholeseller, Tan Eng Chuan, said he goes through at least 30 crates of durians a day during durian season – as much as 1,800 kg. Being able to use the parts of the fruit that are ordinarily discarded, he said, was an innovation that would make enjoying it “more sustainable.”",Reuters,"Sep 20, 2021 9:19 AM PHT"

It also showed the booster enhanced cell-based responses to the coronavirus.
The findings, yet to undergo peer review, come as China starts to give a third COVID-19 shot to higher risk members of the population, as concerns grow that waning antibody levels over time could weaken protection against the virus.
The Sinopharm vaccine is among China’s major inoculation tools and is also used in countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Cambodia.
About five months after a second Sinopharm dose, the average concentration of neutralizing antibody against the virus dropped by 70% from the level seen four weeks after that shot, according to analysis of samples taken from vaccinated healthcare workers.
But one week after a third shot, the antibody concentration had increased 7.2-fold compared with the level seen five months after the second shot, researchers from a hospital affiliated with the Sun Yat-sen University said in the paper.
The study on the BBIBP-CorV shot did not discuss how the changes in antibody concentration might impact the vaccine’s efficacy, or how the boosted antibody works against variants of the virus.
Several other vaccines have also shown declines in antibody levels over time and their developers have used such data to make a case for boosters.
But some scientists say more data is needed to decide whether boosters are needed.
Cellular responses, another important part of the human immune system, also improved after the third Sinopharm shot, the paper said.
“Both humoral and cellular responses were induced by the third dose of robustly and rapidly,” researchers said, adding the cellular responses could be key for durable protection.
But two experts outside the study said the implication of the cellular readings could be limited, partly because it remains unclear how T cell-mediated responses correlate with COVID shots’ protection.",Reuters,"Sep 17, 2021 6:59 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kong-panel-advises-single-dose-biontech-covid-19-shot-teens/,Hong Kong panel advises single dose of BioNTech COVID-19 shot for teens,"A panel of health experts advising the Hong Kong government has recommended children aged 12-17 should get only one dose of BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine after reports of heart inflammation as a side effect.
Professor Lau Yu-lung, who chairs the health committee advising the government on its vaccination program, told public broadcaster RTHK the side effect was more prevalent than originally thought.
He said experts decided it was better for teenagers to get only one dose to “greatly reduce the chance of heart inflammation”. Hong Kong’s low COVID-19 risk also means that one dose should offer sufficient protection, he said.
The Asian financial hub has largely controlled the coronavirus, with no locally transmitted cases in many weeks.
Government data shows that 41 cases involving heart inflammation have been reported from people who took the BioNTech vaccine as of end-August, or just 0.0009%.
Among these cases, 16 involved adolescents aged 12-15 or 0.008% of those vaccinated in that age group. Their symptoms resolved after treatment.
Hong Kong has been using two COVID-19 vaccines, namely the Sinovac and BioNTech shots. But people aged 12-17 are eligible only for the BioNTech vaccine.
Hong Kong has administered 448,800 doses for this age group and around 65%, or 290,000 adolescents, have had at least one vaccine dose.
Regulators in the United States, the European Union and the World Health Organization have said that mRNA vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer and by Moderna are associated with rare cases of myocarditis or pericarditis, but that the benefits of the shots outweigh the risks.
Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle that can limit the organ’s ability to pump blood and can cause changes in heartbeat rhythms. Pericarditis is an inflammation of the lining around the heart.
Pfizer has said it  recognized there could be rare reports of myocarditis after vaccinations but that such side effects were extremely rare.
BioNTech and its Chinese sales agent, Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
The risk of myocarditis was 18.5 per million doses given among people aged 18 to 24 after their second Pfizer dose, and 20.2 per million for that age group for recipients of a Moderna second dose. The risk decreases with age, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The British government on Monday said England would begin vaccinating those aged 12-15 next week, using the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, but that second doses would not be offered to the age group until at least spring, as its top medical advisers wait for more data from around the world.
Norway said earlier this month it would also begin to offer a single dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to those aged 12-15 and a decision on second doses would come later.
Around 65% of Hong Kong’s residents have had their first vaccine dose, but the take-up by older people remains low due to concerns about side effects.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-protection-wanes-makes-case-booster/,"Moderna says COVID-19 vaccine protection wanes, makes case for booster","New data from Moderna Inc’s large COVID-19 vaccine trial shows that the protection it offers wanes over time, supporting the case for booster doses, the company said in a news release on Wednesday, September 15.
“This is only one estimate, but we do believe this means as you look toward the fall and winter, at minimum we expect the estimated impact of waning immunity would be 600,000 additional cases of COVID-19,” Moderna President Stephen Hoge said on a conference call with investors.
Hoge did not project how many of the cases would be severe, but said some would require hospitalization.
The data stands in stark contrast with data from several recent studies that suggested Moderna’s vaccine protection lasts longer than a similar shot from Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE.
Experts said the difference is likely due to Moderna’s higher dose of messenger RNA (mRNA) and the slightly longer interval between the first and second shots.
Both vaccines proved to be exceedingly effective at preventing illness in their large Phase III studies.
Wednesday’s analysis, however, showed higher rates of infection among people vaccinated roughly 13 months ago compared with those vaccinated roughly eight months ago. The study period was from July-August, when Delta was the predominant strain. It has yet to undergo peer review.
Moderna on September 1 submitted its application to the US Food and Drug Administration seeking authorization for a booster shot.
Hoge said data from its booster studies shows the vaccine could increase neutralizing antibodies to levels even higher than were seen after the second dose.
“We believe this will reduce COVID-19 cases,” he said. “We also believe that a third dose of mRNA-1273 has a chance of significantly extending immunity throughout much of next year as we attempt to end the pandemic.”
Briefing documents from the FDA’s analysis of Pfizer’s booster application, released earlier on Wednesday, suggest that a key issue the agency will consider is whether vaccine protection is waning.
In its analysis, Moderna compared the vaccine’s performance in more than 14,000 volunteers vaccinated between July and October of 2020 with some 11,000 volunteers originally in the placebo group who were offered the shot between December 2020 and March 2022 following its US emergency use authorization.
In the two-month period from July-August, researchers identified 88 COVID-19 cases among those who got the two shots more recently, compared with 162 cases among those vaccinated last year. Overall, only 19 cases were considered severe, a key benchmark in assessing waning protection.
Moderna said there was a trend toward a lower rate of severe cases among the more recently vaccinated, although the finding was not statistically significant.
Data from a separate study presented on Wednesday conducted with Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system, meanwhile, shows that Moderna’s vaccine continued to perform well against the Delta variant.
Researchers compared data on more than 352,000 people who got two doses of the Moderna vaccine with the same number of unvaccinated individuals and found the Moderna vaccine was 87% effective at preventing a COVID-19 diagnosis, and 96% effective at preventing hospitalization.
Hoge said the vaccine’s initial performance is strong, but argued that protection shouldn’t be allowed to wane.

The three-page outline is addressed to countries, international organizations, and private sector groups invited to a virtual COVID-19 summit planned by the United States on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly beginning this week.
The document also asks countries with “relevant capabilities” to donate a billion additional vaccine doses and expedite delivery of 2 billion doses already committed.
White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed the 70% vaccination target, but gave no further details about the summit or the document. The New York Times, which first reported the new targets, said summit invitations to world leaders were sent last week.
The US document calls for richer countries to ensure at least $3 billion is made available in 2021 and $7 billion in 2022 for vaccine readiness and to combat vaccine hesitancy.
Other key targets include ensuring at least one in 1,000 people are tested weekly before the end of 2021, and building surge capacity to ensure that all healthcare workers have access to personal protective equipment such as masks in 2021.
The draft also called on richer countries to provide $2 billion to bolster the supply of bulk liquid oxygen, donate at least 1 billion test kits by 2022 for low- and lower-middle income countries, and donate $3 billion in COVID-19 therapeutic medicines through 2022.
It called on the private sector to fund a $2 billion global strategy to boost the supply of oxygen systems by the end of next year, and to make testing kits available in poorer countries for no more than $1 a kit.
Last month, the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and other international groups urged world leaders to accelerate vaccinations, warning that fewer than 2% of adults in most low-income countries were vaccinated, compared with almost 50% in high-income countries.

The scientists said more evidence was needed to justify boosters. That view disagrees with US government plans to begin offering another round of shots to many fully vaccinated Americans as soon as next week, contingent on approval from health regulators.
As COVID-19 cases caused by the Delta variant of the virus rise, President Joe Biden’s administration is concerned that infections among those already vaccinated are a sign that their protection is waning and has pushed boosters as a way to rebuild immunity.
The WHO has argued that the vaccines are still needed for first doses around the globe.
“Any decisions about the need for boosting or timing of boosting should be based on careful analyses of adequately controlled clinical or epidemiological data, or both, indicating a persistent and meaningful reduction in severe disease,” the scientists wrote in the Lancet medical journal.
The risk-benefit evaluation should consider the number of severe COVID-19 cases that boosting would be expected to prevent, and whether it is safe and effective against the current variants, they said.
“Current evidence does not, therefore, appear to show a need for boosting in the general population, in which efficacy against severe disease remains high,” the scientists wrote.
Some countries have begun COVID-19 booster campaigns, including Israel, providing some of the data on which the Biden administration has made its case for additional shots.
The article’s authors included the FDA Office of Vaccines Research and Review Director Marion Gruber and Deputy Director Phil Krause, both of whom plan to leave the agency in the next several months.
They acknowledged that some individuals, such as those who are immunocompromised, could benefit from an additional dose.
Broader use of boosters may be needed in the future if there is waning immunity to the primary vaccination or if new variants evolve so that the vaccines no longer protect against the virus, they said.
Boosters could also prove risky if introduced too soon or too frequently, the scientists wrote.
A panel of experts that advises the FDA on vaccines plans to meet on Sept. 17 to discuss additional doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, the first step in a wider booster roll-out.

The advice from the Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) paves the way for the broad vaccination of children aged 12-15 in Britain, after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization (JCVI) earlier in the month decided against making the recommendation.
The United States, Israel and some European countries have rolled out vaccinations to children more broadly, putting pressure on the British government to follow suit.
The CMOs said that vaccinating children could reduce disruption to schools, and that “on balance provide sufficient extra advantage… to recommend in favour of vaccinating this group.”
“(The UK CMOs) therefore recommend on public health grounds that ministers extend the offer of universal vaccination with a first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to all children and young people aged 12-15 not already covered by existing JCVI advice,” the CMOS said in a letter.
The government must formally indicate whether it will follow the CMOs’ advice, though some ministers have previously expressed support for vaccinations for children. Vulnerable children in that age bracket were already eligible for shots.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/factors-increase-risk-vaccinated-people-getting-covid-19/,4 factors that increase the risk of vaccinated people getting COVID-19,"Two weeks after your second COVID-19 vaccine dose, the protective effects of vaccination will be at their highest. At this point, you’re fully vaccinated. If you still get COVID-19 after this point, you’ve suffered a “breakthrough” infection. Broadly speaking, breakthrough infections are similar to regular COVID-19 infections in unvaccinated people – but there are some differences. Here is what to look out for if you’ve had both jabs.
According to the COVID Symptom Study, the five most common symptoms of a breakthrough infection are a headache, a runny nose, sneezing, a sore throat, and loss of smell. Some of these are the same symptoms that people who haven’t had a vaccine experience. If you haven’t been vaccinated, three of the most common symptoms are also a headache, sore throat, and runny nose.
However, the two other most common symptoms in the unvaccinated are fever and a persistent cough. These two “classic” COVID-19 symptoms become much less common once you’ve had your jabs. One study has found that people with breakthrough infections are 58% less likely to have a fever compared with unvaccinated people. Rather, COVID-19 after vaccination has been described as feeling like a head cold for many.
Vaccinated people are also less likely than unvaccinated people to be hospitalized if they develop COVID-19. They’re also likely to have fewer symptoms during the initial stages of the illness and are less likely to develop long COVID.
The reasons for the disease being milder in vaccinated people could be because vaccines, if they don’t block infection, seem to lead to infected people having fewer virus particles in their body. However, this has yet to be confirmed.
In the UK, research has found that 0.2% of the population – or one person in every 500 – experiences a breakthrough infection once fully vaccinated. But not everyone is at the same risk. Four things appear to contribute to how well you are protected by vaccination.
1. Vaccine type
The first is the specific vaccine type you received and the relative risk reduction that each type offers. Relative risk reduction is a measure of how much a vaccine reduces the risk of someone developing COVID-19 compared to someone who didn’t get vaccinated.
Clinical trials found that the Moderna vaccine reduced a person’s risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 by 94%, while the Pfizer vaccine reduced this risk by 95%. The Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines performed less well, reducing this risk by about 66% and 70% respectively (though protection offered by the AstraZeneca vaccine appeared to rise to 81% if a longer gap was left between doses).
2. Time since vaccination
But these figures don’t paint the complete picture. It’s becoming increasingly evident that length of time since vaccination is also important and is one of the reasons why the debate over booster immunizations is growing in intensity.
Early research, still in preprint (and so yet to be reviewed by other scientists), suggests that the Pfizer vaccine’s protection wanes over the six months following vaccination. Another preprint from Israel also suggests that this is the case. It’s too soon to know what happens to vaccine efficacy beyond six months in the double vaccinated, but it’s likely to reduce further.
3. Variants
Another important factor is the variant of the virus that you’re facing. The reductions in risk above were calculated largely by testing vaccines against the original form of the coronavirus.
But when facing the Alpha variant, data from Public Health England suggests that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine is slightly less protective, reducing the risk of getting COVID-19 symptoms by 93%. Against Delta, the level of protection falls even further, to 88%. The AstraZeneca vaccine is also affected this way.
The COVID Symptom Study backs all of this up. Its data suggests in the two to four weeks after receiving your second Pfizer jab, you’re around 87% less likely to get COVID-19 symptoms when facing delta. After four to five months, that figure falls to 77%.
4. Your immune system
It’s important to remember that the above figures refer to average risk reduction across a population. Your own risk will depend on your own levels of immunity and other person-specific factors (such as how exposed you are to the virus, which might be determined by your job).
Immune fitness typically reduces with age. Long-term medical conditions may also impair our response to vaccination. Older people or people with compromised immune systems may therefore have lower levels of vaccine-induced protection against COVID-19, or may see their protection wane more quickly.
It’s also worth remembering that the most clinically vulnerable received their vaccines first, possibly over eight months ago, which may heighten their risk of experiencing a breakthrough infection due to protection waning.
Vaccines still vastly reduce your chances of getting COVID-19. They also to an even greater degree protect against hospitalization and death.
However, it’s concerning seeing breakthrough infections, and the worry is that they might increase if vaccine protection does, as suspected, fall over time. Hence the UK government is planning to give a booster dose to those most vulnerable, and is also considering whether boosters should be given more widely. Other countries, including France and Germany, are already planning on offering boosters to groups considered to be at higher risk from COVID-19.
But even boosters end up being used, this shouldn’t be interpreted as vaccines not working. And in the meantime, it’s essential to promote vaccination to all those eligible who have not yet been vaccinated. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

The Galleri test looks at the DNA in a patient’s blood to determine if any come from cancer cells. Earlier diagnosis of cancers leads to dramatically increased survival rates.
The NHS said it wanted to recruit 140,000 volunteers in England to see how well the test worked as part of a randomized control trial. Half of the participants will have their blood sample screened with the Galleri test right away.
“We need to study the Galleri test carefully to find out whether it can significantly reduce the number of cancers diagnosed at a late stage,” said Peter Sasieni, professor of cancer prevention at King’s College London.
“The test could be a game changer for early cancer detection and we are excited to be leading this important research.”
Lung cancer is by far the most common cause of cancer death in the United Kingdom, accounting for around a fifth of all cancer deaths. Lung, bowel, prostate, and breast cancers account for 45% of the United Kingdom’s cancer deaths, the NHS said.

BioNTech has said it expected to file its regulatory dossier on the five to 11 year olds in September. It has also laid out plans to seek approval in children aged 6 months to 2 years later this year.
Tuereci also told Spiegel that final production steps were being adjusted to bottle a lower-dose pediatric version of its established Comirnaty vaccine. It is currently approved for adults and youngsters at least 12 years of age.
The raw trial data was now being prepared for a regulatory filing and “things are looking good, everything is going according to plan”, Chief Executive Ugur Sahin told Der Spiegel.
Runner-up Moderna said on Thursday a trial testing its shot in children between six and 11 years was now fully enrolled and that it was working on the best dosage in another study involving infants as young as six months.
China has been ahead in lowering the age limit of its immunization campaign. The country’s health authorities in June approved emergency use of Sinovac’s vaccine in children as young as three years.
Chile, which has relied heavily on Sinovac’s shot, this month approved use of the vaccine in children over 6 years of age.
Israel’s health ministry said in July that children as young as five can get the Pfizer-BioNTech shot if they suffer from conditions that make them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.",Reuters,"Sep 10, 2021 11:44 PM PHT"

The company hopes to eventually add vaccines it is working on for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other respiratory diseases as an annual shot.
“We believe this is a very large opportunity that is ahead of us, if we could bring to market a high efficacy pan-respiratory annual booster,” Moderna Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel said during a presentation to update investors on its drugs in development.
“We believe Moderna could be first to market in this important new opportunity,” he said.
The company is conducting clinical trials for an RSV vaccine in older adults.
Moderna and Pfizer Inc and German vaccine partner BioNTech SE are already expected to reap billions of dollars from COVID-19 booster shots, analysts and healthcare investors said. Adding influenza and other diseases could further boost those profits.
Moderna shares were up 6.2% on Thursday.
The drugmaker already had several influenza vaccine candidates in development. The new vaccine combines the experimental flu shot that is furthest along with its COVID-19 vaccine.
Oppenheimer & Co analyst Hartaj Singh said the news that clinical testing of combination vaccines was likely to begin over the next 6-12 months was a positive surprise for investors.
“The question becomes that after the pandemic is over, how much do total vaccine sales become and how much can Moderna expand that market,” Singh said.
Novavax Incorporated, which does not yet have US authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine, said on Wednesday, September 8, it has initiated an early-stage study to test its combined flu and COVID-19 shots.
Moderna also provided updates on its ongoing mid-stage trial testing its authorized COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 6 months to 11 years old. It is testing a 50-microgram dose of the shot in the pediatric trial involving 4,000 children.
Moderna’s vaccine, which received an emergency use authorization for two 100-microgram doses for people aged 18 and older in the United States in December, is currently under an FDA review for use in adolescents.
Moderna said dose selection studies for different age groups such as 2 years to less than 6 years, and 6 months to below 2 years old, were still underway.

The study, among the first analyses in China combing different COVID-19 vaccines, comes as the country said it would use booster shots in specific groups amid concerns over vaccines’ waning protection over time.
Participants who received a CanSinoBIO booster dose three to six months after a second Sinovac shot showed a 78-fold jump on average in neutralizing antibody levels two weeks later, according to a paper published on Monday before a peer review.
By contrast, those who received a Sinovac booster shot showed a 15.2-fold increase in neutralizing antibody levels, researchers from local disease control authorities, CanSinoBIO and other Chinese institutions said in the paper.
One dose of Sinovac followed by a CanSinoBIO booster at intervals of one or two months led to a 25.7-fold increase in neutralising antibody levels, while two doses of Sinovac induced a 6.2-fold increase.
The study analyzed data from about 300 healthy adults aged 18-59.
The study did not assess the boosters’ protection against COVID-19 and did not test the neutralizing antibody against the more transmissible Delta variant, the paper said.
More than 1.4 billion doses of the Sinovac vaccine have been administered globally, about three quarters of them in China.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/thailand-cites-positive-results-sinovac-astrazeneca-vaccine-formula/,Thailand cites positive results from Sinovac-AstraZeneca vaccine formula,"Thailand’s health ministry said on Thursday, September 2, that its COVID-19 vaccine regimen of China’s Sinovac followed by British-developed AstraZeneca was safe and successfully boosted immunity among its first 1.5 million recipients.
Thailand in July became the first country in the world to mix a Chinese vaccine and a Western-developed vaccine as cases and deaths in the country surged and the government struggled with vaccine supplies.
“The cross formula has been injected to over 1.5 million people and it is safe. Please don’t say things that would create concern,” senior health official Supakit Sirilak told a news conference.
He said Thailand, which has been manufacturing the AstraZeneca vaccine, would no longer be giving two doses of Sinovac’s CoronaVac.
Just 13% of Thailand’s population of over 66 million has been fully vaccinated.
The majority of its 1.2 million infections and 12,103 coronavirus deaths came after April this year, brought on by the highly transmissible Alpha and Delta variants.
The health ministry said the Sinovac-AstraZeneca combination boosted immunity to the same levels as two AstraZeneca shots and meant vaccinations could be completed faster due to the shorter dose gap.
The formula will be used for most of Thailand’s vaccinations, Public Health Permanent Secretary Kiatiphum Wongrajit said.
Booster doses will be given to 3 million people who received two Sinovac shots, using a different type of vaccine, likely from this month, health minister Anutin Charnvirakul has said.
Sinovac’s inactivated virus vaccine has caused concern in some countries about its resistance to the Delta variant.
Earlier this week during a censure debate on the coronavirus crisis, Anutin told lawmakers not to criticize Sinovac, to protect the Thai public and avoid harming ties with China.
“Tarnishing of the Sinovac vaccine by many (house) members may create panic, confusion and concern for the public,” he said.
A recent study in Guandong found that  Sinovac’s vaccine prevented against severe or critical illness during an outbreak involving the Delta variant.
Sinovac spokesman Liu Peicheng told Reuters preliminary results based on blood samples from those vaccinated with its shot showed a three-fold reduction in neutralizing effect against the Delta.
He said a booster shot following the two dose-based regimen could quickly elicit stronger and more durable antibody reaction against the Delta. However, he didn’t provide detailed data.",Reuters,"Sep 2, 2021 6:34 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/do-not-worry-covid-19-vaccines-unnatural-synthetic/,You don’t need to worry about COVID-19 vaccines being ‘unnatural’ or ‘synthetic’,"The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines are some of our best weapons in the fight against COVID-19. They’re highly effective and many millions of people around the world have received their doses.
These vaccines are the first to be made synthetically, that is, they are made outside of a living cell.
Some posts on social media grasp onto the fact they are not “natural” and have created anxiety in vaccine-hesitant people by playing on this point.
So what does it mean for the mRNA vaccines to be synthetic, and why is that OK?
Humans have been inoculating with germs to train our bodies to fight infectious diseases for a long time.
Even before the famous experiments of Edward Jenner (credited with developing smallpox vaccine) in the mid 18th century, Chinese and some European societies were using material from cow pustules to protect against smallpox.
In the 20th century vaccine production gathered pace, using weakened or inactivated viruses.
Many viruses for vaccines are grown in chicken eggs, making this a problem for those allergic to eggs. Some of the newest vaccines, like the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, are grown in cells in large fermentation tanks. Recombinant protein vaccines, such as the hepatitis B vaccine, are made inside bacteria, then purified for use.
So we now have a whole range of different types of vaccines, each made differently, providing protection against different conditions. The thing all these vaccines have in common is that they are grown inside a living cell, so might be considered “natural.”
The mRNA vaccines are the first synthetic vaccines.
mRNA is a temporary genetic instruction that tells our cells to make a particular protein. It consists of a central portion with the genetic code for the protein and shorter portions either side that are important for the “readability” of the code.
mRNA vaccines are made in reaction vessels (large containers), and involve first making mRNA, then wrapping that in oily coats.
To make the mRNA, we use methods figured out in the 1970s, in a process known as “transcription,” where a DNA template is copied, creating an mRNA version of the genetic sequence.
This mRNA production is very similar to what happens when our cells make our own mRNA. The oily coats are also made synthetically and are very similar to lipids in our cells.
The definition of synthetic is where a substance or compound is made by chemical synthesis, especially to imitate a natural product.
What is important to recognize is that, from a chemical perspective, a compound is the same, whether it was made by a living organism inside a cell, or whether it was made in a lab. If a chemist synthesizes a compound, and a biochemist extracts the same compound from a natural source, those two compounds are identical.
This understanding was developed in the 19th century, when the concept of “vitalism” was being challenged. Vitalism espouses that organic materials cannot be created from inorganic matter. But we know now this is not the case.
A classic experiment was reported by Friedrich Wöhler, who synthesized urea (a molecule also produced by our bodies and found in urine) by heating a chemical called ammonium cyanurate. The synthetic urea was identical to natural urea, even though his synthetic method was nothing like the biological production of urea.
We don’t even think about it, but many of us eat and drink a huge number of synthetic molecules each day.
Vitamin C in pills, for example, is usually synthetic, but it still works because it is identical to the vitamin C we get from fresh fruits and vegetables. In fact, many of the dietary supplements that we take are synthetic.
Some common medicines, like aspirin, are synthetic variants of naturally occurring biomolecules.
Other fully synthetic molecules, like aspartame (artificial sweetener), are consumed in large quantities, up to hundreds of milligrams per soft-drink can. These quantities are thousands of times greater than the doses of the mRNA vaccines (between 30 and 100 micro-grams).
While the components of mRNA vaccines are almost identical to the components in our cells, there are some differences.
mRNA is a chain of linked building blocks, or nucleosides. Most of the mRNA vaccine building blocks – the As, Gs, and Cs that make up the mRNA genetic code – are the same as the ones in our cells, and are originally extracted from yeast.
The fourth building block, U, is replaced with a component called N1-methylpseudouridine to make the mRNA more stable and stop our cells breaking it up immediately.
Although this component is not normally found in our mRNA, this modified building block is found in some archaea, microbes that can be found in extreme environments on earth, but also in our guts and in our belly buttons.
The vaccine mRNA gets degraded relatively quickly, just like our own mRNAs get degraded.
The individual mRNA building blocks are salvaged by our efficient cell recycling system, and can be used to make new mRNAs, while other parts are excreted in urine.
So after a few days there is unlikely to be any mRNA vaccine left in our bodies. But hopefully it will have done the job needed to teach our immune system to recognize SARS-CoV-2 and prevent the worst symptoms of COVID-19.
Actually, the ability to make mRNA vaccines outside of cells is one of the strengths of the technology. By eliminating the need for growing cells, or viruses, in some ways it simplifies vaccine production.
On the other hand, synthesis involves its own complex technical steps, but in the coming years we will likely see innovation in simplifying this too. In fact, the World Health Organization is calling for all countries in the developing world to learn to make mRNA vaccines.
Hopefully when the next pandemic hits the world will be ready. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-finds-stainless-steel-particles-suspended-doses-moderna-vaccine/,Japan finds stainless steel particles in suspended doses of Moderna vaccine,"Japan’s health ministry said on Wednesday, September 1, that contaminants found in suspended Moderna Inc COVID-19 vaccines were particles of stainless steel, and it did not expect they would pose an additional health risk.
Japan suspended the use of 1.63 million doses of the Moderna vaccine last week after being notified of contamination that local media reported was metallic. The findings on Wednesday were the result of an investigation by domestic distributor Takeda Pharmaceutical Co, the ministry said in a statement.
“Stainless steel is routinely used in heart valves, joint replacements and metal sutures and staples. As such, it is not expected that injection of the particles identified in these lots in Japan would result in increased medical risk,” Takeda and Moderna said in a joint statement.
The use of three lots of Moderna vaccines was suspended on Thursday after 39 vials were found to contain foreign material. All the vials came from a single lot, but two others were suspended as a precaution as they all came from the same manufacturing line of Spanish pharmaceutical company Rovi, which bottles Moderna vaccines.
The most probable cause of the contamination was related to friction between two pieces of metal in the machinery that puts stoppers on the vials, Takeda said, citing a joint investigation with Moderna and Rovi. The material was confirmed to be grade 316 stainless steel.
The three suspended lots were the only ones affected by the manufacturing issue and Rovi has taken corrective measures, the statement said.
Use of other doses of the Moderna vaccine from different batches also was temporarily halted in three regions in Japan this week. In some cases, foreign substances have been found in unused vials, whereas others appear to be caused when bits of the vials’ rubber stopper break off when needles are incorrectly inserted.
The contamination issue gained more attention after the health ministry said on Saturday that two men, aged 38 and 30, died in August within days of receiving their second Moderna doses. Each had received a dose from one of the suspended lots.
The cause of death in the two cases is still being investigated. Takeda said there was no evidence the fatalities were caused by the vaccine.

In a bulletin dated August 31 and released on Wednesday, September 1 (Manila time), the health body said the Mu variant was found to have a “constellation of mutations” that suggest it could potentially be more resistant to vaccines, but that further study was needed to confirm this.
“More studies are required to understand the phenotypic and clinical characteristics of this variant,” it added.
Mu was classified a variant of interest on August 30, 2021.
Variants are added to the WHO’s list of interest if they have genetic changes that are either predicted or known to affect the virus’ “transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, diagnostic or therapeutic escape.” It is also classified as such if deemed to cause “significant community transmission” or multiple clusters in countries where its prevalence also increases as cases climb over time.
Cases of Mu, or B.1.6.21, were first identified in Colombia in January this year and have also been reported in countries in South America and Europe.
“There have been a few sporadic reports of cases of the Mu variant and some larger outbreaks have been reported from other countries in South America and in Europe,” the WHO said.
Scientists in the Philippines have not yet reported cases of the Mu variant.
The WHO said that global prevalence of Mu among sequenced cases declined and was currently below 0.1%, although its prevalence in Colombia and Ecuador has “consistently increased.” Interpreting the prevalence of Mu should be done with caution, considering the varying capacities for sequencing and timeliness of reporting from different countries, it added.
“The epidemiology of the Mu variant in South America, particularly with the co-circulation of the Delta variant, will be monitored for changes,” the WHO said.
Aside from Mu, the WHO is monitoring four other variants of interests, including Eta, Iota, Kappa, and Lambda. Another four variants of concern are also being watched closely: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta.",Sofia Tomacruz,"Sep 1, 2021 6:33 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/philips-start-replacing-millions-respiratory-devices/,Philips to start replacing millions of respiratory devices,"Dutch health technology company Philips on Wednesday, September 1, said it would start repairing and replacing millions of respiratory devices in the United States and most of its other markets this month, to address potential health risks caused by the machines.
The company in June recalled up to four million of its respiratory devices and ventilators, as it said a foam part might degrade and become toxic, potentially causing cancer.
Philips said it had received authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the rework of the affected DreamStation device, allowing it to replace the sound abatement foam with a new material.
More than half of the affected machines have been sold in the US and the full replacement effort will take about a year, Philips said.
Philips shares have lost about 15% of their value since the recall, as investors fear the possible costs of a number of class action lawsuits that have been launched over the affair.

A study published in the scientific journal Molecules this month found that the molecule produced by the jararacussu pit viper inhibited the virus’s ability to multiply in monkey cells by 75%.
“We were able to show this component of snake venom was able to inhibit a very important protein from the virus,” said Rafael Guido, a University of Sao Paulo professor and an author of the study.
The molecule is a peptide, or chain of amino acids, that can connect to an enzyme of the coronavirus called PLPro, which is vital to reproduction of the virus, without hurting other cells.
Already known for its antibacterial qualities, the peptide can be synthesized in the laboratory, Guido said in an interview, making the capture or raising of the snakes unnecessary.
“We’re wary about people going out to hunt the jararacussu around Brazil, thinking they’re going to save the world…. That’s not it!” said Giuseppe Puorto, a herpetologist running the Butantan Institute’s biological collection in Sao Paulo. “It’s not the venom itself that will cure the coronavirus.”
Researchers will next evaluate the efficiency of different doses of the molecule and whether it is able to prevent the virus from entering cells in the first place, according to a statement from the State University of Sao Paulo (Unesp), which was also involved in the research.
They hope to test the substance in human cells but gave no timeline.

The AstraZeneca vaccine will take the place of a dummy shot in the trial, which will enroll about 4,000 candidates worldwide. It will test SK’s candidate, GBP510, in combination with GSK’s vaccine booster after positive early-stage data and a greenlight from South Korea earlier this month.
Shots from Pfizer, Moderna, J&J and AstraZeneca have been approved for use in South Korea. However, its inoculation campaign has been dogged by vaccine shortages and shipment delays amid a surging fourth wave of infections.
A potential success of the SK vaccine, the country’s first domestic candidate, would help cut reliance on Western shots.
“While many countries have made good progress with vaccination, there remains a need for accessible and affordable COVID-19 vaccines to ensure equitable access and to protect people across the world,” said GSK Chief Global Health Officer, Thomas Breuer.
The GSK-SK vaccine, if approved, would be supplied worldwide through the World Health Organization-led COVAX vaccine sharing program, the companies said, adding that results from the study were expected in the first half next year.
Researchers in some countries may not be able give a placebo shot to people where an effective vaccine is widely available for ethical reasons. France’s Valneva is also conducting a late-stage trial against AstraZeneca’s shot.
The vaccine by SK, also a contract manufacturer for AstraZeneca and Novavax, is a coronavirus protein-based vaccine, while AstraZeneca’s shot uses a modified version of a common-cold virus to deliver immunity-building instructions.
British drugmaker GSK, the world’s largest vaccine maker by sales, has focused on supplying its adjuvant, or booster, to developers rather than make its own shot in the first leg of the vaccine race.

https://www.rappler.com/environment/pollution/use-leaded-gasoline-eliminated-milestone-health-environment/,"Use of leaded gasoline eliminated in ‘milestone’ for health, environment – UN","Leaded gasoline has been eliminated after the world’s last remaining stocks were used up last month, the UN’s Environment Program (UNEP) said on Monday, August 30, after heading a 19-year campaign to end use of the poisonous substance that poses major health and environment risks.
Algeria, the only country still pumping leaded gasoline into vehicles, exhausted its final stocks in July, UNEP said.
The agency said the gasoline contaminates air, soil, and drinking water and can cause heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Some studies have shown it harms brain development, especially in children.
UNEP worked with governments, businesses, and civic groups to eradicate leaded gasoline and said ending its use after a century marked a “huge milestone.”
“Leaded fuel illustrates in a nutshell the kind of mistakes humanity has been making at every level of our societies,” Inger Anderson, UNEP executive director, told journalists.
Those mistakes had driven climate change, pollution, and a loss of biodiversity, she said, but the global response to lead in fuel shows that “humanity can learn from and fix mistakes that we’ve made.”
Lead’s toxicity has been recognized since Roman times. It nevertheless began being added to gasoline in the early 1920s to make cars more powerful, and from then on was used in all gasoline globally until the 1970s when wealthier countries began phasing it out.
But in the early 2000s, 86 nations were still using leaded gasoline. The UNEP-led campaign was formed to help them move away from the fuel including by driving investment and overcoming concerns around prices, Anderson said.
UNEP warned, however, that the transport industry remained a driver of climate-warming emissions, and 1.2 billion vehicles were set to hit the road in the coming decades.
Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary General, said the elimination of leaded gasoline showed what could be achieved via collaboration, and called for similar initiatives towards emissions-free transport and tackling climate change.

https://www.rappler.com/world/africa/south-africa-detects-new-coronavirus-variant/,"South Africa detects new coronavirus variant, still studying its mutations","South African scientists have detected a new coronavirus variant with multiple mutations but are yet to establish whether it is more contagious or able to overcome the immunity provided by vaccines or prior infection.
The new variant, known as C.1.2, was first detected in May and has now spread to most South African provinces and to seven other countries in Africa, Europe, Asia, and Oceania, according to research which is yet to be peer-reviewed.
It contains many mutations associated in other variants with increased transmissibility and reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies, but they occur in a different mix and scientists are not yet sure how they affect the behavior of the virus. Laboratory tests are underway to establish how well the variant is neutralized by antibodies.
South Africa was the first country to detect the Beta variant, one of only four labeled “of concern” by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Beta is believed to spread more easily than the original version of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and there is evidence vaccines work less well against it, leading some countries to restrict travel to and from South Africa.
Richard Lessells, an infectious disease specialist and one of the authors of the research on C.1.2, said its emergence tells us “this pandemic is far from over and that this virus is still exploring ways to potentially get better at infecting us.”
He said people should not be overly alarmed at this stage and that variants with more mutations were bound to emerge further into the pandemic.
Genomic sequencing data from South Africa show the C.1.2 variant was still nowhere near displacing the dominant Delta variant in July, the latest month for which a large number of samples was available.
In July C.1.2 accounted for 3% of samples versus 1% in June, whereas Delta accounted for 67% in June and 89% in July.
Delta is the fastest and fittest variant the world has encountered, and it is upending assumptions about COVID-19 even as nations loosen restrictions and reopen their economies.
Lessells said C.1.2 may have more immune evasion properties than Delta, based on its pattern of mutations, and that the findings had been flagged to the WHO.
A spokesman for South Africa’s health department declined to comment on the research.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/contaminant-moderna-vaccines-suspected-metallic-particles/,Contaminant in Moderna vaccines suspected to be metallic particles – NHK,"A contaminant found in a batch of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines delivered to Japan is believed to be a metallic particle, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, citing sources at the health ministry.
Japan on Thursday, August 26, suspended the use of 1.63 million doses shipped to 863 vaccination centers nationwide, more than a week after the domestic distributor, Takeda Pharmaceutical, received reports of contaminants in some vials.
NHK, in a report published late on Thursday, cited ministry sources as saying the particle reacted to magnets and was therefore suspected to be a metal. Moderna has described it as “particulate matter” that did not pose a safety or efficacy issue.
A health ministry official said the composition of the contaminant has not been confirmed. Takeda did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters.
News of the contaminant could provide a fresh setback for Japan’s inoculation drive as it struggles to persuade many – particularly young people – to get vaccinated.
On Friday, eight more prefectures entered a state of emergency, meaning about 80% of Japan’s population is under coronavirus restrictions. The government reported nearly 25,000 new infections and severe cases at a record 2,000 for Thursday.
The ministry has said the suspension of the Moderna batches was a precaution but it prompted several Japanese companies to cancel worker vaccinations and the European drugs regulator to launch an investigation.
Airline ANA Holdings said it had secured more Moderna supplies and would resume inoculations on Saturday after a two-day suspension of the shots.
Spanish pharma company Rovi, which bottles Moderna vaccines for markets other than the United States, said the contamination could be due to a manufacturing issue on a production line. A spokesperson said the company could not say anything more while it was investigating.
Moderna put the lot in question and two adjacent ones on hold.
Another health ministry official said it would take “some time” to confirm how many shots from the contaminated batch had been administered in Japan. Kyodo News reported that at least 176,000 shots have been used based on its own tally of figures reported by municipalities.
About 54% of Japan’s population has received at least one dose, according to a Reuters tracker. Taro Kono, the minister in charge of the vaccination program, said he did not expect the contamination issue to have an impact on the government’s goal of fully inoculating the adult population by November.",Reuters,"Aug 27, 2021 5:15 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-says-covid-19-will-not-disappear-near-future-what-now/,"COVID-19 won’t be gone in the near future, says WHO. What now?","After over year of contending with uncertainty brought about by the pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) says it is likely that COVID-19 will stick around, at least for the foreseeable future.
WHO Western Pacific Regional Director Dr. Takeshi Kasai said that, up until a few weeks ago, the region had fared “comparatively well,” but that recently several countries were now seeing surges that had pushed health systems to the brink.
Whereas cases in the region had accounted for about 2% of global COVID-19 cases and deaths, cases in the first three weeks of August comprised over 10% of new global cases and more than 8% of new global deaths.
Kasai pointed to the highly contagious Delta variant, which was partly driving the surge, as a factor that had posed a “real threat” to even the strongest health capacity in the region. The variant’s higher transmissibility means clusters of cases quickly lead to bigger outbreaks, making it more important for countries to keep their guards up.
“However, even with all our best efforts, it now seems clear that, globally, the virus will not disappear – at least not in the near future.  And while the virus is spreading anywhere, every country remains at risk,” Kasai said in a briefing on Wednesday, August 25.
Consensus is building around this view. Like Kasai, many scientists and medical experts have said they expected the coronavirus would become endemic or a more regular part of our lives, as opposed to earlier on in the pandemic, when officials sought to stamp out COVID-19.
Does this mean that COVID-19 can no longer really be controlled? No, Kasai said, adding this possibility made it even more imperative that the virus should be controlled.
Kasai said reality presents us with two scenarios: learning to “live with the virus,” or failing to learn and seeing the rise of more dangerous variants that can thwart progress made so far.
Kasai likened the first outcome to how seasonal influenza and vaccine preventable diseases are already managed. “We focus on trying to limit spread, protecting the most vulnerable and, in doing so, reduce the health and broader social impacts of outbreaks.”
To achieve that, the WHO said risks of the virus could be reduced by strategically deploying vaccines, making the best use of prevention measures, and responding to increases in cases where they occur with “short, targeted measures.”
Achieving this is not as straightforward, however, as extended quarantine restrictions have taken their toll on many populations and governments run out of resources to stem the spread of COVID-19.
Aside from this, COVID-19 vaccines, which have been touted to deliver a way out the pandemic, remain in short supply, with many developing countries waiting on doses while higher income countries are already mulling over giving extra doses to their wider populations.
The scenario of vaccine inequality had prompted fierce criticism from WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who called for a temporary moratorium on COVID-19 boosters.
The WHO warned that the world was at a “critical point” in the pandemic where countries “must do all we can to avoid” the rise of more dangerous variants.
“It is in our power to shape the course that the pandemic takes next,” Kasai said. He urged governments and the public to “do everything” to avoid the scenario where the virus would be allowed to evolve into more dangerous variants.
“A lot remains uncertain. But at this critical moment in the pandemic, we must continue to make the best decisions we can, based on experience, shared learning and reliable data, in order to create the future that we want,” he said.",Sofia Tomacruz,"Aug 27, 2021 9:00 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/innovations/thailand-develops-robotic-system-more-vaccine-doses/,Thailand develops robotic system to squeeze out more vaccine doses,"As Thailand struggles with its worst coronavirus outbreak yet, researchers in the country have developed a machine to draw out COVID-19 vaccine doses more efficiently and optimize lower-than-expected supplies.
Using a robotic arm, the “AutoVacc” system can draw 12 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in four minutes from a vial, according to researchers at Chulalongkorn University, who made the machine that has been used at the university’s vaccination center since Monday.
That is up 20% from the standard 10 doses drawn manually, they said. The machine only works on AstraZeneca multi-dose vials currently and labels show each vial can provide 10 to 11 doses.
“The machine guarantees with accuracy that we can gain an extra 20% from each vaccine vial – from 10 to 12 doses,” said Juthamas Ratanavaraporn, the lead researcher of the team at the university’s Biomedical Engineering Research Center.
“The extra 20% that we get means that if we have AstraZeneca for 1 million people, this machine can increase the number of doses to 1.2 million people,” said Juthamas.
While some health workers using low dead space syringes (LDSS) that aim to reduce wastage can draw up to 12 doses per vial, it requires manpower and a high level of skill, she said.
“This could drain a lot of the health workers’ energy. They would have to do this every day for many months,” Juthamas said.
Thailand had kept COVID-19 largely under control for much of the pandemic, but more virulent variants like Delta have sent cases and deaths soaring since April, ramping up pressure on authorities to increase the pace of vaccinations.
So far, around 9% of Thailand’s population of more than 66 million have been fully vaccinated, with the rollout hindered by lower-than-anticipated vaccine supplies.
The research team say they should be able to produce 20 more AutoVacc units within three or four months, but that government funds and support would be needed to expand across the country.
The prototype machine costs 2.5 million baht ($76,243), including other materials like syringes, said Juthamas, adding that while they were open to export opportunities, that was something for the future.
They also plan to make similar machines to use with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, she added.
Juthamas said the machine was aimed at removing burdens on health workers. Thailand has reported around 1.1 million COVID-19 infections and 10,085 deaths in total, pushing parts of the health system to the brink.
“When the health workers are too tired, there are also chances of human error, so we should let the machines work on this,” she said.",Reuters,"Aug 25, 2021 3:50 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/high-blood-pressure-driven-obesity-poverty-who/,"High blood pressure driven by obesity, poverty – WHO study","Nearly 1.3 billion people globally suffer from hypertension, a silent killer often driven by obesity that increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday, August 25.
Hypertension can be easily diagnosed by monitoring blood pressure, and treated with low-cost drugs, but half of affected people are unaware of their condition which is left untreated, the WHO and Imperial College London said in a joint study published in The Lancet.
While hypertension rates have changed little in 30 years, the caseload has shifted to lower-income countries as wealthy nations have brought it largely under control, the study said.
“It is far from being a condition of affluence, it’s very much a condition of poverty,” Majid Ezzati, professor of global environmental health at Imperial College London, told a news briefing.
“Many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, parts of South Asia, some of the Pacific island nations, they are still not getting the treatments that are needed,” he said.
Some 17.9 million people died in 2019 from cardiovascular diseases, accounting for one in three global deaths, with hypertension a major factor, according to the WHO.
“We know that the treatment is cheap, it’s low-cost medicines. But there is a need to include them in the UHC (universal health coverage) so this is not a cost for the patient, it has to be covered by the insurance system,” said Bente Mikkelsen, director of the WHO’s department of noncommunicable diseases.
Apart from genetic risk factors for hypertension, there are “modifiable risk factors” linked to lifestyle, Mikkelsen said.
These include unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco, and alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes, and being overweight, she said. Referring to obesity, she said: “This is really the tsunami of the risk factors.”",Reuters,"Aug 25, 2021 11:24 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/delta-covid-19-cases-higher-viral-load/,Delta COVID-19 cases show 300 times higher viral load – South Korea study,"People infected with the more transmissible Delta variant have a viral load 300 times higher than those with the original version of the COVID-19 virus, when symptoms are first observed, a South Korea study found.
But the amount gradually decreased over time – to 30 times in four days and over 10 times in nine days – and it matched levels seen in other variants after 10 days, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said on Tuesday.
The higher load means the virus spreads far more easily from person to person, increasing infections and hospitalizations, health ministry official Lee Sang-won told a news conference.
“But it doesn’t mean Delta is 300 times more infectious…we think its transmission rate is 1.6 times the Alpha variant, and about two times the original version of the virus,” Lee said.
The Delta variant of the novel coronavirus was first identified in India and the Alpha variant in the UK.
To avoid the spread of the Delta variant, now the dominant strain worldwide, the KDCA urged people to immediately get tested when developing COVID-19 symptoms and avoid in-person meetings.
The rapid spread of the Delta variant and low vaccination rates have caught much of Asia off-guard, especially in emerging markets, even as economies in Europe and North America reopen.
The study compared the viral load of 1,848 patients infected with the Delta variant with 22,106 people who had other strains.
South Korea reported 1,509 new coronavirus cases for Monday, raising the total to 239,287 infections, with 2,228 deaths.
It has vaccinated 51.2% of its 52 million population with at least one dose of a vaccine, while 23.9% have been fully vaccinated.",Reuters,"Aug 24, 2021 5:39 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/why-no-longer-think-we-can-eliminate-covid-19/,Public health expert: Why I no longer think we can eliminate COVID-19,"Around the world, countries are having to strike a balance between COVID-19 cases and restrictions. In the UK and the US, daily new cases number in the thousands, but restrictions and limitations are being lifted. In contrast, New Zealand has started a short national lockdown to contain just a handful of cases.
For the past 20 months, New Zealand, Australia, and several other east Asian countries have pursued tough policies aiming to completely eradicate COVID-19. The hallmarks of these “zero COVID” approaches are strict border controls and quarantine arrangements as well as the early introduction of lockdowns when discovering cases.
So far they’ve helped minimise infections and deaths. The economic impacts experienced by countries adopting these approaches have also been less severe than those who have not. New Zealand has said it intends to continue its COVID-19 eradication strategy indefinitely.
Is this sustainable? In an ideal world, completely eliminating COVID-19 is what all countries would aim to do, and earlier on in the pandemic I supported this strategy. But now the pandemic has evolved, the approach makes less sense.
Many countries now have high levels of the virus circulating and aren’t aiming to eradicate it. And it’s unlikely countries with few infections, such as New Zealand or Australia, can continue to keep COVID-19 at bay indefinitely in a world where the virus circulates.
There will always be the risk of importation by infected travelers from other regions. And in a globalized world, isolating a country from most others long term would likely be too costly and unpopular to maintain. Plus, it requires a degree of luck. Vietnam, Thailand, and South Korea, once cited as zero COVID success stories, have struggled to contain the virus when it’s been imported despite various border controls being in place.
The fact that the virus is mutating may explain why they’ve found it harder to keep it at bay. The virus is becoming better at spreading in humans. The Alpha variant is around 50% to 100% more transmissible than the original virus that emerged in late 2019, and Delta around 50% more transmissible than Alpha. The more infectious the virus becomes, the more that has to be done to enforce suppression.
There are other factors to consider too. The virus can infect both domestic and wild animals. If humans give the virus to animals, such that new viral reservoirs are created, then the virus could then potentially spill back into humans after being suppressed.
On top of this, a large proportion of human infections are asymptomatic. These infections are difficult to detect early and so are likely to spread. Both factors raise the likelihood of COVID-19 being reintroduced at some point – unless high levels of restrictions in zero COVID countries persist.
But how long will people continue to support a zero COVID approach if it means periodically entering lockdown to handle a small numbers of cases? In Australia, people appear to be growing tired of repeated restrictions, especially as the virus seems to be taking hold anyway. Trust in the government’s COVID-19 response is waning and stress is building. That said, support is still there for New Zealand’s strict approach.
An important counterpoint is that countries such as Australia and New Zealand still have low vaccine coverage. Relaxing current policies may see the virus spread quickly and cause large amounts of disruption, illness, and death that could be avoided.
And although zero COVID policies are costly, one thing this pandemic has taught us is that in the short term, adopting a stringent approach leads to the least damage to the health and wealth of societies. In countries with low levels of infection and low vaccine coverage, there’s a very good case for continuing with maximum suppression.
But it’s less clear what the optimal long-term solution is. The virus has yet to settle into its ecological niche, so it’s unclear what behaviors it will eventually fall into. There are several possible outcomes, and they depend on to what degree vaccines block people from catching and spreading the virus, as opposed to simply stopping them from getting ill.
If vaccines protect well enough against infection, and enough of the population is vaccinated, then cases should subside to low levels. It may then be possible to achieve eradication of COVID-19 across much of the world through immunization, much like measles. There will remain the risk of the virus being reintroduced from areas where cases are higher or of the virus persisting in unvaccinated groups – which is how measles behaves today.
However, it’s not known how long vaccine protection lasts, and substantial inequity in global vaccine distribution is a significant barrier to widespread suppression of COVID-19. Increasingly, the view of public health experts is that reaching population-level immunity is unachievable at the present time.
The other possibility is that vaccines do not sufficiently block the spread of infection. In this scenario, the virus would continue to circulate, but with severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths reduced. We would see periodic outbreaks and probably seasonal epidemics, similar to flu. This is the more likely scenario. The focus then would be less on trying to stop the spread of infection and more on protecting vulnerable individuals through immunization.
Accepting that COVID-19 will become endemic – as many already are – and preparing for that eventuality may be the only realistic endgame strategy for all countries. As such, countries with low levels of infection and immunity, like Australia and New Zealand, should urgently immunize their populations. This is key if they want to avoid the considerable COVID-19 mortality and morbidity seen in Europe and the Americas.
But once this is done, continuing with recurrent lockdowns could be both socioeconomically disruptive and challenging to maintain public support for. Together with the virus being more transmissible, the near impossibility of having completely closed off borders long term, and the fact that other countries aren’t pursuing zero COVID, these factors likely will make completely eliminating the virus unachievable. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/israeli-doctors-severe-covid-19-breakthrough-cases-mostly-older-sicker-patients/,"Israeli doctors find severe COVID-19 breakthrough cases mostly in older, sicker patients","In Israel’s COVID-19 wards, doctors are learning which vaccinated patients are most vulnerable to severe illness, amid growing concerns about instances in which the shots provide less protection against the worst forms of the disease.
Around half of the country’s 600 patients presently hospitalized with severe illness have received two doses of the Pfizer Inc shot, a rare occurrence out of 5.4 million fully vaccinated people.
The majority of these patients received two vaccine doses at least five months ago, are over the age of 60 and also have chronic illnesses known to exacerbate a coronavirus infection. They range from diabetes to heart disease and lung ailments, as well as cancers and inflammatory diseases that are treated with immune-system suppressing drugs, according to Reuters interviews with 11 doctors, health specialists and officials.
Such “breakthrough” cases have become central to a global debate over whether highly vaccinated countries should give booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and to which people.
Israel began offering booster doses to people age 60 and up in July, and has since expanded that eligibility.
The United States, citing data out of Israel and other findings, said on Wednesday, August 18, it would make booster doses available to all Americans beginning in September.
Other countries, including France and Germany, have so far limited their booster plans to the elderly and people with weak immune systems.
“The vaccinated patients are older, unhealthy, often they were bedridden before infection, immobile and already requiring nursing care,” said Noa Eliakim-Raz, head of the coronavirus ward at Rabin Medical Center in Petach Tikva.
In contrast, “the unvaccinated COVID patients we see are young, healthy, working people and their condition deteriorates rapidly,” she said. “Suddenly they’re being put on oxygen or on a respirator.”
Israel’s Health Ministry raised new alarm this week with a report showing the effectiveness against severe disease of the Pfizer vaccine, developed with Germany’s BioNTech, appeared to have dropped from more than 90% to 55% in people age 65 and up who received their second jab in January.
Disease experts say it is not clear how representative the figures are, but agree it is concerning given evidence that overall vaccine protection against infection is waning.
They cannot say whether that is due to the amount of time that has passed since inoculation, the ability of the highly contagious Delta variant to evade protection, the age and underlying health of the people vaccinated, or a combination of all of these factors.
Health officials in the UK and United States, two other nations with high vaccination rates and a spike in Delta infections, have reported similar trends.
In the UK, about 35% of the people hospitalized with a Delta case in recent weeks had received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Nearly three-quarters of US breakthrough infections that led to hospitalization or death were among people age 65 or older, according to federal data.
US officials said their booster plan is based on concern that over time, the vaccines will provide less protection against severe disease, including among younger adults.
“We are watching other countries carefully and (are) concerned that we too will see what Israel is seeing, which is worsening infections over time” among vaccinated people, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said at a press conference on Wednesday.
The World Health Organization has repeatedly urged wealthy nations to refrain from providing boosters while much of the world has yet to access their first COVID vaccine doses.
The Delta variant, first identified in India, has become the dominant version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus globally, accelerating a pandemic that has killed more than 4.4 million people.
In Israel, daily new cases have increased from the single digits in June to around 8,000 since the arrival of Delta. Approximately half of the cases – the majority of them mild to moderate – are in vaccinated people.
Those vaccinated first in Israel were at high-risk, including people age 60 and up. The immune response of some may have weakened by the time Delta hit Israel. But for others with underlying health conditions, the vaccine may have not kicked in at all.
“For some of them the vaccine did not trigger an immune response, they had no antibodies, because of the illness itself or because they are treated with medication that suppresses the immune system,” said Dror Mevorach, who heads the coronavirus ward at Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem. He cited examples such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma.
Among 3 million vaccinated Israelis covered by Clalit, the country’s largest healthcare provider, 600 have suffered severe breakthrough cases since June. Around 75% of them were above the age of 70 and were at least 5 months after their second dose, according to Ran Balicer, Clalit’s chief innovation officer. Nearly all of them have chronic illnesses.
“We are hardly seeing young vaccinated people in severe condition,” said Balicer.
In the UK, doctors described similar characteristics among vaccinated patients who fall severely ill.
“In those people who come in, because of their age, because of their comorbidities, they might be people that you would expect that the vaccine is not quite so efficacious as other age groups,” said Tom Wingfield, a clinical lecturer at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.
A new surge in US coronavirus cases and deaths has been fueled by Delta, particularly in states where vaccination rates remain low. Among vaccinated patients who become infected, there is evidence of older people being hit harder.
In Texas, 92% of the vaccine breakthrough cases that resulted in death were in people over the age of 60 and 75% had a known underlying condition that put them at high risk from COVID-19, according to a public health department spokesperson.
Initial data in Israel suggests the booster shots administered in the last few weeks are reducing the risk of infection in older people compared with those who have received only two doses..
Even without boosters, Israeli doctors say that vaccinated patients tend to recover more quickly.
“The vaccinated patients I’ve treated usually left the ICU in about three days. The unvaccinated patients took a week or two until they stabilized,” said Yael Haviv-Yadid, head of the critical care ward at Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv.
Even if the vaccine did not stop them getting ill, it may have mitigated their illness, said Alex Rozov, head of the coronavirus ward at Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon.
“Our cautious impression is that the vaccinated patients suffer an easier course of illness – the treatment is more effective among those who have antibodies.”",Reuters,"Aug 20, 2021 2:36 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/united-states-fda-authorizes-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-for-the-immunocompromised/,US FDA authorizes COVID-19 vaccine boosters for the immunocompromised,"The US Food and Drug Administration authorized a third dose of COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna for people with compromised immune systems.
The amended  emergency use authorization paves the way for people who have had an organ transplant, or those with a similar level of weakened immune system, to get an extra dose.
“After a thorough review of the available data, the FDA determined that this small, vulnerable group may benefit from a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines,” Janet Woodcock, US FDA’s acting commissioner, said in a tweet on Thursday.
“Others who are fully vaccinated are adequately protected & do not need an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine at this time.”
The vulnerable group of patients make up less than 3% of US adults, Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), had said before the authorization.
A panel of advisers to the CDC will meet on Friday to discuss booster doses, and a vote later by the committee will help decide on the roll out of the extra shots.
Scientists are still divided over the broad use of COVID-19 vaccine boosters among those without underlying problems as benefits of the boosters remain undetermined.
Pfizer has said the efficacy of the vaccine it developed with BioNTech drops over time, citing a study that showed 84% effectiveness from a peak of 96% four months after a second dose.
Moderna has also said it sees the eventual need for booster doses, especially since the Delta variant has caused “breakthrough” infections in fully vaccinated people.
Reports of infections among vaccinated people and concerns about diminishing protection have galvanized wealthy nations to distribute booster shots, even as many countries struggle to access first vaccine doses.
The World Health Organization last week called for a moratorium on COVID-19 vaccine booster shots until at least the end of September.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-moderna-seen-reaping-billions-covid-19-vaccine-booster-market/,"Pfizer, Moderna seen reaping billions from COVID-19 vaccine booster market","Drugmakers Pfizer Inc, BioNTech and Moderna Inc are expected to reap billions of dollars from COVID-19 booster shots in a market that could rival the $6 billion in annual sales for flu vaccines for years to come, analysts and healthcare investors say.
For several months, the companies have said they expect that fully inoculated people will need an extra dose of their vaccines to maintain protection over time and to fend off new coronavirus variants.
Now a growing list of governments, including Chile, Germany, and Israel, have decided to offer booster doses to older citizens or people with weak immune systems in the face of the fast-spreading Delta variant.
Late on Thursday, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized a booster dose of vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc for people with compromised immune systems.
Pfizer, along with its German partner BioNTech, and Moderna have together locked up over $60 billion in sales of the shots just in 2021 and 2022. The agreements include supply of the initial two doses of their vaccines as well as billions of dollars in potential boosters for wealthy nations.
Going forward, analysts have forecast revenue of over $6.6 billion for the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and $7.6 billion for Moderna in 2023, mostly from booster sales. They eventually see the annual market settling at around $5 billion or higher, with additional drugmakers competing for those sales.
The vaccine makers say that evidence of waning antibody levels in vaccinated people after six months, as well as an increasing rate of breakthrough infections in countries hit by the Delta variant, support the need for booster shots.
Some early data suggests that the Moderna vaccine, which delivers a higher dose at the outset, may be more durable than Pfizer’s shot, but more research is needed to determine whether that is influenced by the age or underlying health of the people vaccinated.
As a result, it is far from clear how many people will need boosters, and how often. The profit potential of booster shots may be limited by the number of competitors who enter the market. In addition, some scientists question whether there is enough evidence that boosters are needed, particularly for younger, healthy people. The World Health Organization has asked governments to hold off on booster shots until more people worldwide receive their initial doses.
“We don’t know what the market forces will be,” Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in an interview last week. “At some point, this will become a more traditional market – we’ll look at what are the populations at risk, what value are we creating, and what are the number of products that serve that value. That will ultimately impact price.”
Pfizer declined to comment for the story. During the company’s second-quarter earnings call, executives said they believe a third dose will be necessary 6 to 8 months after vaccination, and regularly afterward.
If regular COVID-19 boosters are needed among the general population, the market would most resemble the flu shot business, which distributes more than 600 million doses per year. Four competitors split the US flu market, which is the most lucrative and accounts for around half the global revenue, according to Dave Ross, an executive at CSL’s flu vaccine unit Seqirus.
Flu vaccination rates in developed countries have settled at around 50% of the population, and COVID boosters would likely follow a similar pattern if approved widely, said Atlantic Equities analyst Steve Chesney.
Flu shots cost around $18 to $25 a dose, according to US government data and competition has kept price increases in check, with producers raising prices 4 or 5% in 2021.
Pfizer and Moderna may have greater pricing power for their boosters, at least at the outset, until competitors arrive. Pfizer initially charged $19.50 per dose for its vaccine in the United States and 19.50 euros for the European Union, but has already raised those prices 24% and 25%, respectively, in subsequent supply deals.
AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson are both gathering additional data on boosters of their vaccines. Novavax, Curevac, and Sanofi could also potentially be used as boosters, though their vaccines have yet to receive any regulatory authorization.
“A lot of these firms aren’t even in the market yet. I think within a year’s time, all these companies will have booster strategies,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, who covers Pfizer.
Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan expects at least 5 players in the COVID-19 booster market within a few years.
There’s still a lot of uncertainty around how boosters would be rolled out in the United States. Still, it is possible or even likely that people will be boosted with different vaccines than they were originally vaccinated with. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is already testing mixed boosting, and other countries that have used so-called mix and match vaccination have not had problems with that strategy.
One factor that could curb prices is if the US government continues paying for most or all of the shots administered in the country, rather than leave it in the hands of private health insurers. In that scenario, the government would still be negotiating prices directly with vaccine makers, and could use its buying power to stave off price increases.
Bijan Salehizadeh, managing director at healthcare investment firm Navimed Capital, said the US government is likely going to want to keep paying in order to keep vaccination rates high and prevent new COVID surges, particularly if a Democratic administration is still in power.
“It’s going to be paid for until the virus disappears or mutates to be less virulent,” Salehizadeh said.",Reuters,"Aug 13, 2021 8:07 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/cdc-recommends-pregnant-women-get-covid-19-vaccine/,CDC recommends pregnant women get COVID-19 vaccine,"Pregnant women should be vaccinated against COVID-19, based on a new analysis that did not show increased risk for miscarriage, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday, August 11.
The CDC said it has found no safety concerns for pregnant people in either the new analysis or earlier studies. It said miscarriage rates after vaccination were similar to the expected rate. Pregnant women in the US can receive any of the three vaccines given emergency authorization – Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson.
The agency had not previously recommended pregnant women get vaccinated but had said that they should discuss vaccination with their health care providers.
Sascha Ellington, team lead for the Emergency Preparedness and Response team in CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health, said that vaccine uptake in pregnant women has been low, with only 23% receiving at least one vaccine dose.
“We want to increase that,” Ellington said, noting that the agency was working on strategies to have obstetricians and gynecologists become vaccine providers. “We want women to be protected. We’re not seeing any safety signals and so the benefits of vaccination really do outweigh any potential or unknown risks.”
Pregnancy increases the risk of severe illness from COVID-19, according to the CDC, and COVID-19 during pregnancy increases the risk for preterm birth.
The CDC said it now recommends all people 12 years and older get vaccinated against COVID-19, including people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant, or might become pregnant in the future.
“We are aware of the myths that have been spreading related to fertility. They are not based on any evidence. There’s no science that backs that up,” Ellington said. “We hope this helps.”

“These therapies – artesunate, imatinib and infliximab – were selected by an independent expert panel for their potential in reducing the risk of death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients,” it said in a statement on the Solidarity PLUS trial.
Artesunate is already used for severe malaria, imatinib for certain cancers, and infliximab for diseases of the immune system such as Crohn’s Disease and rheumatoid arthritis.
The original Solidarity trial last year found that all four treatments evaluated – remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon – had little or no effect in helping COVID patients.
So far, only corticosteroids have been proven effective against severe and critical COVID-19.
The WHO said artesunate, produced by Ipca, is used to treat malaria. In the trial, it will be administered intravenously for seven days, using the standard dose recommended for the treatment of severe malaria.
Imatinib, produced by Novartis, is used to treat certain cancers. In the trial, it will be administered orally, once daily, for 14 days.

https://www.rappler.com/science/discoveries-inventions/volcanic-soil-mayon-contain-potential-bacteria-with-antibiotic-anti-cancer-properties/,"Volcanic soil in Mayon contain bacteria with potential antibiotic, anti-cancer properties","Volcanoes are regarded as among the planet’s most powerful forces.
Take a look at Mayon in the province of Albay, one of the most active volcanoes in the Philippines. The majesty of Mayon’s almost perfect cone shape seems like an irony to the destruction it can cause once it erupts.
But the same destructive volcanic eruption leaves the environment teeming with nutrients that feeds the volcanic ecosystem. In fact, a team of Filipino researchers found a thriving community of microbes in the soils of Mayon. Among the bacteria the team found potentially have antibiotic and anti-cancer properties.
“The volcano is an interesting environment for us microbiologists since Mt. Mayon is an active volcano. Before we took samples, a year or two before that, it erupted. That’s why it caught our attention. We might encounter a new species, or probably those microbes thriving in that environment can be really unique and special,” said Kristel Oliveros, assistant professor at the University of the Philippines Los Baños’ Microbiology Division.
Oliveros, the project leader of the study, hails from Sorsogon. She was initially interested in contributing to the body of knowledge surrounding the Bicol region.
“Ang environment kagaya ng Mt. Mayon, mataas ang input ng nutrients, kada sumasabog iyan, nage-emit iyan ng mga pyroclastic materials galing sa lupa. Iyan ‘yung nagsisilbing nutrients ng bacteria,” said Albert Rosana, who is currently a PhD student at the University of Alberta in Canada. Rosana is also working with Oliveros and the team in the study.
(Mt. Mayon has high nutrient input as every time it erupts, it emits pyroclastic materials from the soil. Those nutrients are being used by the bacteria.)
Rosana added that because the volcano is rich in sulfur, it has the potential to host unique bacteria which can metabolize or subsist sulfuric compounds.
“We can consider it as an extreme environment that’s why Mayon has extreme bacteria, which apparently Kristel isolated,” Rosana said.
OIiveros and her team initially isolated 30 bacterial species from a composite sample of Mt. Mayon’s volcanic soils at different elevations. One of the species they found is currently known as Streptomyces sp. A1-08.
Through genomic sequencing, the process of figuring out the order of the DNA bases of an organism, the team tried to match the bacteria species in the database to check if it is a new species.
“Lumalabas na it is less than the gold standard na 95%. Sa microbial taxonomy, kapag less than 95%, candidate novel species na iyan,” said Rosana.
(It appears that it is less than the gold standard that is 95%. In microbial taxonomy, when it is less than 95%, it could be considered as a candidate novel species.)
He explained that the International Society for Systematics and Evolutionary Biology would be the one to set the standards if Streptomyces sp. A1-08 is a novel species. Once they confirm that the bacteria species is new, the scientists will name it Streptomyces mayonensis A1-08, in honor of the place where the bacteria species was found.
“‘Pag nakatuklas ka ng isang bagong novel species, susunod doon, gusto mong malaman ano pa ang possible at kaya niyang gawin…. And if it is also unique, that would lead us into another phase of study, eventually drug discovery later in the pipeline,” said Oliveros.
(If you discover a novel species, the next step is to find out what it is capable of doing…. And if it is also unique, that would lead us into another phase of study, eventually drug discovery later in the pipeline.)
Thirteen of the bacteria species the team isolated showed varying antibiotic activities in different test organisms that were known as pathogenic to humans or plants. Streptomyces sp. A1-08 also showed antibiotic activity against numerous potentially pathogenic microorganisms and anti-colorectal cancer potential.
In general, Streptomyces species are known to produce medically and pharmaceutically important products. But this particular bacteria species the team isolated, Streptomyces sp. A1-08, stood out as it was able to fight all test microorganisms, including the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
MRSA is strongly resistant against antibiotics which makes treatment of infections more difficult. Further, Streptomyces sp. A1-08 also showed potential to fight colorectal cancer.

Although the paper is lined up on the PJS‘s December 2021 issue, its full copy will be uploaded immediately on the journal’s website as soon as it’s ready for public reading.
The scientists consider their discovery monumental, but they are aware that they shouldn’t stop there. Their study is only the first step in the long process of potentially discovering a new drug.
“This is beyond finding a needle in a haystack. Because a haystack is way smaller than the Mayon, considering that Kristel and the team climbed the volcano at 500, 1,000, 1,500 meters above sea level (Mayon is around 2,400 meters above see level),” said Rosana.
“Kung magtutuluy-tuloy itong research namin, na kahit ‘yung compound, novel din siya, we’ll push this through the pipeline for drug discovery research. And end-product namin talaga dito, the wildest dream for the team right now, makapag-produce ng gamot kung saan man siya effective. Pero alam namin na malayo pa ang tatakbuhin. Di naman ito overnight,” said Oliveros.
(If we eventually find that the compound we have is also novel, we’ll push through the pipeline for drug discovery research. Our team’s wildest dream is to produce a medicine where this compound could be found effective. However, we are aware that this is a long process. It’s not an overnight thing.)
Oliveros believes that their study proves that it is also important to look at the research of budding scientists. This discovery started as a master’s thesis in 2013.

The researchers also hope that their study will inspire a generation of young researchers to explore the treasure trove that is Philippine natural resources.
“Kung ico-consider natin ang biodiversity status ng Pilipinas, tayo ay isang megadiverse biodiversity hotspot, we have the highest biodiversity status. Lalong-lalo na tayo ay archipelagic, ‘yung forces governing the evolution ng species na ito, mas malaki ang chance na endemic sila sa atin sa Pilipinas. So kung mawawala ang pagkakataon na maka-discover ng bagong bacteria dahil nasira na, let’s say hindi na-conserve, hindi naprotektahan ang mga environments na iyan, that’s essentially a lost opportunity,” said Rosana.

It is worth noting that because the Philippines is an archipelago, the forces governing the evolution of species in the Philippines, there is a higher chance that these are endemic to the country.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/heart-stroke-risks-climb-after-covid-19-flu-shots-protective/,"Heart, stroke risks climb after COVID-19; flu shots may be protective","The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19.
COVID-19 increases patients’ risks for heart attack and stroke, suggests a study from Sweden that compared 86,742 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 and 348,481 people without the virus. In the week following a COVID-19 diagnosis, the risk of a first heart attack went up three- to eight-fold, and the risk of a first stroke due to a blood-vessel blockage rose three- to six-fold, the researchers found. The risks then dropped steadily but remained elevated for at least four weeks, according to the report in The Lancet.
The researchers did not include COVID-19 patients who had had heart attacks or strokes in the past, but for them, the risk of another heart attack or stroke is probably even higher, said coauthor Dr. Anne-Marie Fors Connolly of Umea University.
Flu vaccination may lower the risk for severe illness from the coronavirus, including life-threatening sepsis infections and strokes, according to a report in PLoS One on Tuesday. The researchers studied nearly 75,000 COVID-19 patients, half of whom had received the most recently available flu shot. They also found fewer patients who had flu shots had to be admitted to intensive care units or visited emergency departments, and fewer had dangerous blood clots in their legs, compared to patients who did not get flu shots. Studies like this one, however, cannot prove that flu vaccines caused the better outcomes, or how they might have done so. Stronger and larger studies would help “to validate these findings and determine if an increased emphasis on influenza vaccination will improve adverse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients,” the authors wrote.
Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections in fully vaccinated people seem to strengthen their immune defenses, suggests a new study posted on medRxiv  ahead of peer review. One month after a COVID-19 outbreak in a German nursing home, doctors collected blood samples from the 23 elderly residents and four staff members who had tested positive. They found that vaccinated residents who still got the virus had significantly higher levels of antibodies afterward than vaccinated residents who did not get infected, and they also had more antibodies that were capable of neutralizing variants of the virus. Coauthor Jorg Timm of Heinrich-Heine-University in Düsseldorf said the findings suggest there might come a time – after most people have developed some level of immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus – when natural infection will have some benefit, but only when it does not lead to severe symptoms or disease.",Reuters,"Aug 7, 2021 10:50 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/south-african-study-high-covid-19-protection-johnson-johnson-shot/,South African study shows high COVID-19 protection from J&J shot,"Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine is working well in South Africa, offering protection against severe disease and death, the co-head of a trial in the country said on Friday, August 6.
The J&J vaccine was administered to healthcare workers from mid-February in a research study, which was completed in May, with 477,234 health workers vaccinated, joint lead investigator Glenda Gray told a media briefing.
South Africa’s health regulator approved the J&J shot in April, and it is being used in the national vaccine program alongside Pfizer’s.
Gray said the single-shot J&J vaccine offered 91% to 96.2% protection against death, while offering 67% efficacy against infection when the Beta coronavirus variant dominates and about 71% when the Delta variant dominates.
“Consistently after receiving the vaccine, there was very little death occurring in the vaccinated group as compared to the control group and showing a remarkable up-to 96.2% protection against death,” Gray said.
“This was our primary endpoint and we are able to say this vaccine protected health workers against death,” she added.
South Africa’s vaccination campaign got off to a shaky start in February after the government paused AstraZeneca vaccinations because of a small trial showing the shot offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness caused by the Beta variant, which was dominant in the country at the time.
Vaccinations have since ramped up, with over 8.3 million people vaccinated as of Thursday, August 5.
Newly appointed health minister Joe Phaahla told the same briefing that the government was planning to start using other vaccines approved by the regulator, including the Sinovac shot.
“It was approved…also that the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has now been shown to be effective against the Delta variant, that we should also look at bringing it back into use,” Phaahla said.",Reuters,"Aug 6, 2021 5:08 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-shot-high-efficacy/,Moderna says COVID-19 shot maintains high efficacy through 6 months,"Moderna Incorporated said on Thursday, August 5, its COVID-19 vaccine was about 93% effective through six months after the second dose, showing hardly any change from the efficacy reported in its original clinical trial.
However, the data does not include the vaccine’s performance against the more contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has caused breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated people.
Given the variant’s impact and expectations that antibody protection will eventually wane, the company said it expects booster shots will be needed this winter.
Moderna, along with Pfizer and German partner BioNTech, which make a similar messenger RNA-based vaccine, has been advocating for booster shots, even as public health officials call for more evidence that they are needed.
The fast-spreading Delta variant, now dominant in many countries, has caused surges in hospitalizations and deaths among the unvaccinated.
But reports of infections among vaccinated people and concerns about diminishing protection has increased pressure on wealthy nations to distribute booster shots, even as many countries struggle to access first vaccine doses.
Pfizer/BioNTech last week presented data showing their vaccine’s efficacy waned about 6% every two months, declining to around 84% six months after the second shot. Pfizer has said it plans to seek US authorization for a third shot later this month.
Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in an interview that the 93% efficacy data covers through March of this year.
“It looks like we’ve got durable efficacy,” Hoge said. “But we are currently blind to what’s been happening around Delta, and particularly around the explosion of cases that’s happened in June and July.”
Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said during a conference call the company will not be able to produce more than the 800 million to 1 billion vaccine doses it has already targeted for this year.
“We are not taking any more orders for 2021 because we are we are totally maxed out,” he said.
The new Moderna data comes from the company’s roughly 30,000-participant clinical trial used to gain emergency authorization for the vaccine in December.
The six-month data also suggests that Moderna’s vaccine still provides 98% protection against severe disease and was 100% effective at preventing death caused by COVID-19.
While the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots are similar, they are not identical. Moderna’s doses contain 100 micrograms of vaccine, while Pfizer’s contains 30 micrograms.
Moderna has been testing lower, 50-microgram dose versions of its vaccine as boosters. Studies of three different booster candidates induced robust antibody responses against variants, including Gamma, Beta and Delta, it said.
Moderna said neutralizing antibody levels following the boost approached those observed after the second shot.
Hoge said the higher dose of its vaccine may be playing a role in durability, but the company is pleased with protection seen in its lower-dose boosters. Moderna is also testing, and has not ruled out, a 100 microgram booster, he said.
For this year, Moderna has signed vaccine contracts worth $20 billion in sales. It has agreements for $12 billion in 2022, with options for another roughly $8 billion in sales, and expects to produce between 2 billion and 3 billion doses next year.
The company has not been able to keep pace with much larger Pfizer, which expects to manufacture as many as 3 billion doses this year and 2021 sales.
Moderna expects to finish its submission seeking full approval of the vaccine with US regulators this month. Some people hesitant to get vaccinated have said they are wary of emergency approvals.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-calls-halting-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-favor-unvaccinated/,WHO calls for halting COVID-19 vaccine boosters in favor of unvaccinated,"The World Health Organization is calling for a halt on COVID-19 vaccine boosters until at least the end of September, its head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday, August 4, as the gap between vaccinations in wealthy and poor countries widens.
The call for a moratorium is the strongest statement yet from the UN agency at a time when countries deliberate the need for boosters to combat the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus.
“I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the Delta variant. But we cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it,” Tedros added.
High-income countries administered around 50 doses for every 100 people in May, and that number has since doubled, according to WHO. Low-income countries have only been able to administer 1.5 doses for every 100 people, due to lack of supply.
“We need an urgent reversal from the majority of vaccines going to high-income countries to the majority going to low-income countries,” Tedros said.
To counter the spread of the Delta variant, some countries have begun to use or started weighing on the need for booster doses even as scientists debate over whether or not extra shots are needed.
“The fact that we are vaccinating healthy adults with a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines is a short-sighted way of thinking,” said Elin Hoffmann Dahl, infectious diseases medical adviser to Medecins Sans Frontieres’ access campaign.
“With the emergence of new variants, if we continue to leave the majority of the world unvaccinated, we will most definitely need adjusted vaccines in the future,” Dahl told Reuters.
Last week, Israeli President Isaac Herzog received a third shot of coronavirus vaccine, kicking off a campaign to give booster doses to people aged over 60 in the country.
The United States in July signed a deal with Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech to buy 200 million additional doses of their COVID-19 vaccine to help with pediatric vaccination as well as possible booster shots.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/south-korea-alert-new-delta-plus-covid-19-variant/,South Korea on alert for new Delta Plus COVID-19 variant,"South Korea has detected its first two cases of the new Delta Plus COVID-19 variant, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said on Tuesday, August 3, as the country battles with its fourth wave of infections.
The Delta Plus variant is a sub-lineage of the Delta variant first identified in India, and has acquired the spike protein mutation called K417N, which is also found in the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.
Reports of Delta Plus cases have been few, and a handful of countries, including Britain, Portugal and India, have reported some cases.
“The first case (in South Korea) was identified in a man in 40s who has no recent travel records,” the KDCA told Reuters. The source of transmission is under investigation.
Test results in around 280 people who were in contact with  the man found that only his son was positive too, Park Young-joon, a KDCA official told a briefing.
Park said it was unclear whether the son was also infected with Delta Plus.
The second case was found in a traveller who returned from the United States. The person had been vaccinated with both shots of AstraZeneca before the trip, Park said.
Health authorities have said several major vaccines work against the highly contagious Delta variant, which has already become dominant in many countries, but have raised concern new strains may evade some vaccines.
Genetic analysis of 3,014 infections last week found 64% were the Delta variant, KDCA data showed, a clear sign the variant has become the dominant strain in South Korea as well. Cases among the fully vaccinated remained low.
Some scientists have said the Delta Plus variant may be even more transmissible. Studies are ongoing in India and globally to test the effectiveness of vaccines against this mutation.
South Korea reported 1,202 new COVID-19 cases for Monday, raising the total to 202,203 infections, with 2,104 deaths.
The country on Tuesday said it has given 20 million people, or 39% of its population, at least one dose of a vaccine, while 14.1% have been fully vaccinated.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/results-latest-studies-delta-lambda-covid-19-variants-august-3-2021/,What do the latest studies say on the Delta and Lambda COVID-19 variants?,"The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19.
Among people infected by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, fully vaccinated people with “breakthrough” infections may be just as likely as unvaccinated people to spread the virus to others, new research suggests. The higher the amount of coronavirus in the nose and throat, the more likely the patient will infect others.
In one Wisconsin county, after Delta became predominant, researchers analyzed viral loads on nose-and-throat swab samples obtained when patients were first diagnosed. They found similar viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, with levels often high enough to allow shedding of infectious virus.
“A key assumption” underlying current regulations aimed at slowing COVID-19 transmission “is that those who are vaccinated are at very low risk of spreading the virus to others,” said study coauthor Katarina Grande of Public Health Madison & Dane County in Madison, Wisconsin. The findings, however, indicate “that vaccinated people should take steps to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus to others,” she added.
In a separate study from Singapore, researchers found that while Delta viral loads were similar in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, the viral loads decreased faster in the vaccinated group. The Wisconsin and Singapore studies were both posted on Saturday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
The Lambda variant of the coronavirus, first identified in Peru and now spreading in South America, is highly infectious and more resistant to vaccines than the original version of the virus the emerged from Wuhan, China, Japanese researchers have found.
In laboratory experiments, they found that three mutations in Lambda’s spike protein, known as RSYLTPGD246-253N, 260 L452Q, and F490S, help it resist neutralization by vaccine-induced antibodies. Two additional mutations, T76I and L452Q, help make Lambda highly infectious, they found.
In a paper posted on Wednesday, August 3, on bioRxiv ahead of peer review, the researchers warn that with Lambda being labeled a “Variant of Interest” by the World Health Organization, rather than a “Variant of Concern,” people might not realize it is a serious ongoing threat. Although it is not clear yet whether this variant is more dangerous than the Delta now threatening populations in many countries, senior researcher Kei Sato of the University of Tokyo believes “Lambda can be a potential threat to the human society.”
Among fully vaccinated people who never had COVID-19, getting a third dose of an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer /BioNTech or Moderna would likely increase levels of antibodies, but not antibodies that are better able to neutralize new virus variants, Rockefeller University researchers reported on Thursday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review.
They note that in COVID-19 survivors, the immune system’s antibodies evolve during the first year, becoming more potent and better able to resist new variants. In 32 volunteers who never had COVID-19, they found that antibodies induced by mRNA vaccines did evolve between the first and second shots. But five months later, vaccine-induced antibodies were “equivalent” to those seen after the second dose, with “little measurable improvement” in the antibodies’ ability to neutralize a broad variety of new variants, said coauthor Michel Nussenzweig. Therefore, he said, giving those individuals a third dose of the same vaccine would likely result in higher levels of antibodies that remain less effective against variants.
“At the moment, the vaccine remains protective against serious infection,” Nussenzweig said. “Should we learn that efficacy is indeed waning for serious infection, which is not really the case to date,” then a booster dose of “whatever is available” might become appropriate, he added. Should an updated vaccine become available that protects against specific variants, “then that would be the choice.”
US childcare providers have higher COVID-19 vaccination rates than US adults in general, a new study suggests. Researchers sent surveys in May and June to nearly 45,000 childcare providers and received responses from 48%. Overall, 78% of respondents said they were fully vaccinated, compared with a rate of about 60% in the general US population. Roughly 73% of home-based caregivers said they were vaccinated, compared to nearly 80% of those working in facilities.
Rates varied widely by state, from a low of 54% in Wyoming to a high of 89% in Massachusetts. The patterns of relative differences in vaccination rates were similar to what is seen in the general population, the researchers reported on Sunday on medRxiv ahead of peer review, with younger, lower-income and Black or African-Americans reporting the lowest vaccination rates.
“Efforts to promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake among childcare providers take on added significance when considering the emergence of the more transmissible Delta variant,” the authors said. With young children ineligible for COVID-19 vaccination, “the limiting factor in ensuring an adequate supply of childcare services will be contingent on protecting the personal health of childcare providers,” they said.",Reuters,"Aug 3, 2021 8:02 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/delta-spreads-like-wildfire-doctors-study-whether-makes-patients-sicker/,Delta spreads ‘like wildfire’ as doctors study whether it makes patients sicker,"With a new wave of COVID-19 infections fueled by the Delta variant striking countries worldwide, disease experts are scrambling to learn whether the latest version of coronavirus is making people – mainly the unvaccinated – sicker than before.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that Delta, first identified in India and now dominant worldwide, is “likely more severe” than earlier versions of the virus, according to an internal report made public on Friday, July 30.
The agency cited research in Canada, Singapore and Scotland showing that people infected with the Delta variant were more likely to be hospitalized than patients earlier in the pandemic.
In interviews with Reuters, disease experts said the three papers suggest a greater risk from the variant, but the study populations are limited and the findings have not yet been reviewed by outside experts. Doctors treating patients infected with Delta described a more rapid onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and in many regions an overall increase serious cases.
But the experts said more work is needed to compare outcomes among larger numbers of individuals in epidemiologic studies to sort out whether one variant causes more severe disease than another.
“It’s difficult to pin down increase in severity and population bias,” said Lawrence Young, a virologist at the UK’s Warwick Medical School.
In addition, it is likely that the extraordinary rate of Delta transmission is also contributing to a greater number of severe cases arriving at hospitals, the experts said.
Delta is as contagious as chickenpox and far more contagious than the common cold or flu, according to the CDC report.
Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, said the clearest indication that the variant may cause more severe disease comes from the Scotland study, which found that Delta roughly doubled the risk of hospitalization compared to an earlier version.
The majority of hospitalizations and deaths from coronavirus in the United States are occurring in people who have not been vaccinated. But there is evidence that the shots are less effective in people with compromised immune systems, including the elderly.
For vaccinated, otherwise healthy individuals, the odds are that if they contract COVID-19 they will only experience asymptomatic or mild disease, said Dr. Gregory Poland, infectious disease expert at the Mayo Clinic.
“But they can pass it on to family members and others who may not be so lucky,” Poland said. “We have to be vaccinated and masked or we will, for the fourth time now, endure another surge and out of that will come worse variants.”
The rate of severe illness, especially in regions where vaccination rates are low, is again straining healthcare workers on the front lines of the pandemic.
“This is like a wildfire, this is not a smoldering campfire. It is full-on flames right now,” said Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director of infection prevention and control at Colorado’s UCHealth.

Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director Colorado’s UCHealth
Research from China suggesting that the Delta variant replicates much faster and generates 1,000 times more virus in the body compared to the original strain highlights the biggest danger of this new wave, Barron said.
“It is hard to tell if they are more sick because of the Delta variant or if they would have been more sick anyway,” she said.
Other doctors said patients infected with Delta appear to become ill more quickly, and in some cases with more severe symptoms, than those they treated earlier in the pandemic.
“We are seeing more patients requiring oxygen sooner,” said Dr. Benjamin Barlow, chief medical officer at American Family Care, a 28-state chain of urgent care clinics.
At his clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, Barlow said that around 20% of patients are testing positive for COVID-19, compared with 2-3% a few weeks ago. Patients are assessed at that time for potential hospital admission and oxygen support.
David Montefiori, director of the Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine Research and Development at Duke University Medical Center, said the Delta variant is more infectious and leads to faster onset of illness – particularly for the unvaccinated.
“Frankly, there’s a severity that comes from this variant that is a little more severe,” Montefiori said on a webcast last week. “It’s not just easier to transmit, it makes you sicker.”",Reuters,"Aug 2, 2021 6:42 PM PHT"

The variant was also more likely to break through protections afforded by the vaccines, the report said, adding that the agency’s reverse course on masking guidelines for fully vaccinated Americans on Tuesday, July 27, was based on this document.
However, CDC’s figures show that the vaccines are highly effective in preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death in vaccinated people, the report said, citing experts.
New research showed the vaccinated people infected with the Delta variant carried tremendous amounts of the virus in the nose and throat, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told the Times.
The Delta variant is more transmissible than the viruses that cause MERS, SARS, Ebola, the common cold, the seasonal flu and smallpox, the report said.
The immediate next step for the agency is to “acknowledge the war has changed,” the report cited the document as saying.

Herzog, 60, received a booster dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at the Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv. He said he was proud to launch the booster vaccination initiative “which is so vital to enable normal circumstances of life as much as possible in this very challenging pandemic.”
The president was accompanied by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who urged the importance of booster shots in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and pledged that Israel would share all the information it gleaned from the initiative.
“Israel is a pioneer in going ahead with the third dose for older people of the age of 60 and above. The fight against the COVID pandemic is a global fight. The only way we can defeat COVID is together,” Bennett said.
The booster campaign, with shots administered by health maintenance organizations, will effectively turn Israel into a testing ground for a third dose before approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
On the eve of the booster rollout Bennett said Israel had already given 2,000 immunosuppressed people a third dose with no severe adverse events.
His government hopes that stepped up inoculation efforts will help avoid further costly lockdowns.
Israel was a world leader in the vaccination rollout, and around 57% of the 9.3 million population has been double-vaccinated. Many seniors got their first shots in December, January and February as they were regarded as the most vulnerable sector of the population.
But since the emergence of the Delta variant, the health ministry has twice reported a drop in the vaccine’s efficacy against infection and a slight decrease in its protection against severe disease.

The 24-year-old American superstar shocked the sporting world by pulling out of the team all-around competition on Tuesday citing the need to protect her mental health. A day later, she withdrew from the individual all-around event.
“We also have to focus on ourselves because at the end of the day, we’re human too,” she told reporters after her team mates surrendered gold and their title to Russian gymnasts.
“We have to protect our mind and our body rather than just go out there and do what the world wants us to do.”
She drew wide support from team mates, fellow Olympians and retired athletes, in a clear sign of how public discussion of issues such as stress and depression have become accepted on social media and more frequent in recent years, particularly since the pandemic.
“It broke my heart,” US swimmer Michael Phelps told broadcaster NBC. “But also, if you look at it, mental health over the last 18 months, is something that people are talking about.”
Phelps, the greatest swimmer in history and the winner of 23 Olympic gold medals, has publicly discussed his own battle with depression, including contemplating suicide.
US swimmer Erica Sullivan, who won the silver medal for the 1500m freestyle, also opened up about her own struggles in a news conference.
“I’m not facing a fraction of the pressure that Simone is, but there was a time in 2018 when I started getting psychological help for my issues, and there was a time when it was so bad that my coach told me I can’t keep racing like this and I will not be racing until I get better,” she said.
Biles’s team mates also lauded her, with Sunisa Lee posting on Instagram: “Proud of you & everything you’ve accomplished! Thank you for being a role model and someone I look up to every single day.”
The empathy was in sharp contrast to what Australian rower Sally Robbins faced in Athens in 2004 when she was overcome by anxiety and quit in the Olympic final. Robbins, dubbed “Lay-Down Sally” by one newspaper, was vilified by her crew mates, one of whom slapped her at an Olympic function.
Robbins later said that she had pushed herself beyond her physical capabilities to please others.
Gold medallist US swimmer Katie Ledecky said she too felt immense pressure. “I would never want to speak for Simone or say that I know what she’s feeling because none of us do, but I understand that we’re at the highest level, we have the most eyes on us, on anyone in the world right now,” she told a news conference following her gold for the 1500m freestyle.
“I’ve gotten to know Simone over the years and we’re in touch every now and then, and you know I hope she knows that I really support her and hope she does really well but this week.”
Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics and a double Olympic champion, said he recognized the “profound challenges facing athletes” in trying to find the balance between the intensity of training and competition and maintaining their mental equilibrium.
Those difficulties were heightened by the pandemic for athletes, given the difficulties in training under lockdown, he told reporters, especially as athletes weren’t able to have their families or personal coaches on site for support.
“The advice I would give is to reach out, to colleagues and friends,” Coe said. “Don’t be afraid to show vulnerability, it’s a badge of honor in a way to want that help.”",Reuters,"Jul 28, 2021 10:16 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/astrazeneca-finds-small-clot-risk-after-first-covid-shot-less-after-second/,"AstraZeneca finds small clot risk after 1st COVID shot, less after 2nd","AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine carries a small extra risk of rare blood clots with low platelets after the first dose and no extra risk after the second, a study led and funded by the drugmaker showed on Wednesday, July 28, after worries over side-effects.
The study, published in the Lancet medical journal, found that the estimated rate of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) after the first dose was 8.1 per million in those inoculated, AstraZeneca said.
After the second dose of the vaccine, branded Vaxzevria and invented by Oxford University, the rate was 2.3 per million, comparable to that seen in unvaccinated people, the Anglo-Swedish company added.
AstraZeneca’s shot has faced several setbacks, including production delays, and rare cases of severe side effects, including TTS, which led to several countries restricting or stopping use of the vaccine, probes by regulators and warning labels.
The European Union’s (EU) drugs regulator has been looking into cases of TTS since March and has found a possible link to Vaxzevria, and to Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 shot. It has, however, maintained that overall benefits of both vaccines outweigh any risks posed by them.
Wednesday’s findings evaluated cases reported as of April 30 that occurred within 14 days of receiving the first or second dose, using AstraZeneca’s global safety database, it said.
Public focus has been high on the vaccine as it had been hailed as potentially the world’s best weapon against the pandemic because it is cheap and easily transportable.
The study said limitations of the analysis included reliance on data provided by healthcare providers and those who got vaccinated, which might lead to under-reporting of cases.
It added that “heightened media attention might have led to event misclassification.”
As of the cut-off date, 13 cases of TTS had been identified globally after the second dose in people aged 45 years to 85 years, including eight women. Some 399 cases were reported after the first, the study showed, while data used for the number of doses administered was limited to the EU, European Economic Area, and Britain.
“Unless TTS was identified after the first dose, these results support the administration of the two-dose schedule of Vaxzevria, as indicated, to help provide protection against COVID-19 including against rising variants of concern,” AstraZeneca senior executive Mene Pangalos said in a statement.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/young-lured-tobacco-addiction-e-cigarettes-who/,Young lured to tobacco addiction via e-cigarettes – WHO,"The tobacco industry’s sleek marketing is attracting youngsters to e-cigarettes which can lead to tobacco addiction, despite claims by some executives that they aim to solve the smoking epidemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday, July 27.
Over eight million people die annually from tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke, making the habit a leading cause of preventable diseases, the WHO said in a report calling for greater regulation of smoke-free devices containing nicotine.
In a weekend interview with Britain’s Mail on Sunday newspaper, Philip Morris International CEO Jacek Olczak was quoted as saying he wanted the tobacco group to be able “to leave smoking behind.”
Asked about such claims, Ruediger Krech, director of the WHO’s department of health promotion, told a briefing on Tuesday: “I don’t believe…that all of a sudden you turn from being the real problem to being part of the solution.”
“While the evidence is not yet totally conclusive on the issue of e-cigarettes, we know that they are also harmful.”
Some 16,000 flavors are on the market for e-cigarettes, including bubble gum, vanilla ice cream, and chocolate cookies, Krech said, adding e-cigarette users were “at least twice if not three times” more likely to become cigarette smokers.
“That calls for exactly the same regulation as cigarettes,” he added.
Tobacco firms promote e-cigarettes through sleek product design, social media influencers, and flavors, said Kelly Henning of Bloomberg Philanthropies, which funded the report.
“We know e-cigarettes are extremely appealing to children and the industry’s goal is to get a whole new generation of users addicted to these products,” she said.
“One in 5 high school kids are using currently e-cigarettes, that’s 3.6 million kids,” she added, referring to adolescents in the United States. “There is still a very large problem here.”
Philip Morris sells IQOS, a device that heats up but does not burn packages of ground-up tobacco, to create a nicotine-filled aerosol similar to that produced by e-cigarettes, which heat flavored nicotine liquid. The company also started selling more traditional e-cigarettes in a few markets last year.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/sinovac-results-patchy-world-cannot-ignore-usefulness/,"Sinovac: Results are patchy, but the world can’t ignore its usefulness","China’s vaccine-development system has been busy during the pandemic. Two Chinese vaccines are now being used around the world: the Sinopharm vaccine and the CoronaVac vaccine.
The latter, developed by the Sinovac Biotech company, is the latest COVID-19 vaccine to be authorized for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO). Because of this, the CoronaVac vaccine could have a big role to play in turning the tide of the pandemic.
Receiving the WHO’s blessing means the vaccine can now be used to supply Covax, the initiative set up to share vaccine doses across the world. This is on top of it being approved for use by 37 countries. Millions are in line to receive the vaccine, and millions already have.
However, CoronaVac’s clinical trial results have painted a mixed picture. And, as with the western COVID-19 vaccines, it’s only now that plenty of doses have been deployed that we’re beginning to get a sense of how effective the vaccine is in real-world conditions.
Like the other notable Chinese COVID-19 vaccine, manufactured by Sinopharm, CoronaVac is an inactivated vaccine. This means it contains whole versions of the coronavirus that have been treated so that they can’t replicate inside the body. These dead viruses are what the body mounts an immune response to.
This is a very different approach to that used by the main western vaccines, which instead deliver some of the coronavirus’s genetic material into the body in order to get it to build specific, recognizable parts of the coronavirus for the immune system to train itself against.
The inactivated vaccine method is a much more well-established way of designing a vaccine. Inactivated vaccines are typically easy to manufacture at large scale and have an excellent safety record. However, they tend to produce a weaker immune response than vaccines that use other designs.
To some extent this is borne out in the results of CoronaVac’s phase 3 clinical trials, which were run across several countries. In a trial run in Brazil, the vaccine prevented people developing symptomatic COVID-19 with 51% efficacy. In another trial in Indonesia, the vaccine showed 65% efficacy. For comparison, the efficacy of the Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines exceeded 90% in their trials.
However, CoronaVac showed very high protection against being hospitalized with COVID-19 in these trials, and almost 100% protection against dying from the disease, and it was on the basis of these findings that the WHO recommended its use. Since then, results of a further phase 3 trial run in Turkey have been published, suggesting that CoronaVac is safe and has an efficacy of 83%.
Why such a difference between these percentages? Well, the prevalence of different coronavirus variants over time and in different places can potentially impact the efficacy observed in clinical trials. Studies conducted in South Africa have had to content with the Beta variant, while those run in Brazil have faced the Gamma variant. There is some evidence that these variants are less susceptible to the effects of current vaccines than some other forms of the virus.
This is where “real-world” studies become vital. By assessing vaccines as they’re being used, they allow you to look at their effectiveness and safety in larger numbers of people than is possible in clinical trials. They also give you a more up-to-date picture of how vaccines are faring against the virus in real time, as it evolves.
For example, a recent real-world study of CoronaVac conducted in Chile included data from 10.2 million people. The researchers calculated that the vaccine was 66% protective against symptomatic disease and offered 88% protection against hospitalization. They also highlighted that the alpha and gamma variants are known to be circulating in Chile, though within their study there was not enough data to estimate the impact of these variants specifically on the vaccine’s effects.
These are good numbers, but still leave the vaccine a little way behind some of the western vaccines. With Pfizer and Moderna, protection against hospitalization was close to 100% in real-world studies involving the Alpha variant, and still around 90% after two doses when considering the Delta variant. There’s also currently precious little data to assess the impact of Delta upon CoronaVac.
Perhaps because of these factors, some governments seem a little unsure about the overall value of CoronaVac. For example, in Thailand, there are plans to administer the AstraZeneca vaccine as the second dose to individuals who had CoronaVac as their first dose. This was after healthcare workers still became infected with COVID-19 despite having had CoronaVac.
However, the WHO Situation Report of July 19 2021 noted that the number of COVID-19 cases reported worldwide increased by 12% in the previous week. Right now, the pandemic is growing.
There are also widespread concerns about unfolding outbreaks in many places across sub-Saharan Africa. Most countries in the continent have populations that are almost entirely unvaccinated and so greatly susceptible to new outbreaks. The tragic circumstances of the huge outbreak earlier this year in India shows how COVID-19 can wreak havoc on a susceptible population.
Therefore, in the context of a pandemic that shows no signs of abating, what does the future hold for CoronaVac? Well, in short, the world needs all the vaccines it can get, and we cannot afford to pick and choose between them. There’s good evidence that all the vaccines approved by the WHO protect against symptomatic disease, and also evidence that they in turn reduce onward transmission.
While vaccine demand continues to greatly outstrip supply and there’s huge inequity in the global vaccine rollout, there remains a big role for CoronaVac to play – even if it is slightly less effective than some other vaccines. Populations remain unprotected. Until that changes, the pandemic won’t end. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/how-delta-variant-upends-assumptions-coronavirus/,How the Delta variant upends assumptions about the coronavirus,"The Delta variant is the fastest, fittest, and most formidable version of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 the world has encountered, and it is upending assumptions about the disease even as nations loosen restrictions and open their economies, according to virologists and epidemiologists.
Vaccine protection remains very strong against severe disease and hospitalizations caused by any version of the coronavirus, and those most at risk are still the unvaccinated, according to interviews with 10 leading COVID-19 experts.
But evidence is mounting that the Delta variant, first identified in India, is capable of infecting fully vaccinated people at a greater rate than previous versions, and concerns have been raised that they may even spread the virus, these experts said.
As a result, targeted use of masks, social distancing, and other measures may again be needed even in countries with broad vaccination campaigns, several of them said.
Israel recently reinstated mask-wearing requirements indoors and requires travelers to quarantine upon arrival.
US officials are considering whether to revise mask guidance for the vaccinated. Los Angeles County, the most populous in the United States, is again requiring masks even among the vaccinated in indoor public spaces.
“The biggest risk to the world at the moment is simply Delta,” said microbiologist Sharon Peacock, who runs Britain’s efforts to sequence the genomes of coronavirus variants, calling it the “fittest and fastest variant yet.”
Viruses constantly evolve through mutation, with new variants arising. Sometimes these are more dangerous than the original.
The major worry about the Delta variant is not that it makes people sicker, but that it spreads far more easily from person to person, increasing infections and hospitalizations among the unvaccinated.
Public Health England said on Friday, July 23, that of a total of 3,692 people hospitalized in Britain with the Delta variant, 58.3% were unvaccinated and 22.8% were fully vaccinated.
In Singapore, where Delta is the most common variant, government officials reported on Friday that three quarters of its coronavirus cases occurred among vaccinated individuals, though none were severely ill.
Israeli health officials have said 60% of current hospitalized COVID-19 cases are in vaccinated people. Most of them are age 60 or older and often have underlying health problems.
In the United States, which has experienced more COVID-19 cases and deaths than any other country, the Delta variant represents about 83% of new infections. So far, unvaccinated people represent nearly 97% of severe cases.
Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases doctor at the University of California, San Francisco, said many vaccinated people are “so disappointed” that they are not 100% protected from mild infections. But the fact that nearly all Americans hospitalized with COVID-19 right now are unvaccinated “is pretty astounding effectiveness,” she said.
“There is always the illusion that there is a magic bullet that will solve all our problems. The coronavirus is teaching us a lesson,” said Nadav Davidovitch, director of Ben Gurion University’s school of public health in Israel.
The Pfizer Inc/BioNTech vaccine, one of the most effective against COVID-19 so far, appeared only 41% effective at halting symptomatic infections in Israel over the past month as the Delta variant spread, according to Israeli government data. Israeli experts said this information requires more analysis before conclusions can be drawn.
“Protection for the individual is very strong; protection for infecting others is significantly lower,” Davidovitch said.
A study in China found that people infected with the Delta variant carry 1,000 times more virus in their noses compared with the original version first identified in Wuhan in 2019.
“You may actually excrete more virus and that’s why it’s more transmissible. That’s still being investigated,” Peacock said.
Virologist Shane Crotty of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego noted that Delta is 50% more infectious than the Alpha variant first detected in the UK.
“It’s outcompeting all other viruses because it just spreads so much more efficiently,” Crotty said.
Genomics expert Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, noted that Delta infections have a shorter incubation period and a far higher amount of viral particles.
“That’s why the vaccines are going to be challenged. The people who are vaccinated have got to be especially careful. This is a tough one,” Topol said.
In the United States, the Delta variant has taken hold just as many Americans – vaccinated and not – have stopped wearing masks indoors.
“It’s a double whammy,” Topol said. “The last thing you want is to loosen restrictions when you’re confronting the most formidable version of the virus yet.”
The development of highly effective vaccines may have led many people to believe that once vaccinated, COVID-19 posed little threat to them.
“When the vaccines were first developed, nobody was thinking that they were going to prevent infection,” said Carlos del Rio, a professor of medicine and infectious disease epidemiology at Emory University in Atlanta. The aim was always to prevent severe disease and death, del Rio added.
The vaccines were so effective, however, that there were signs they also prevented transmission against prior coronavirus variants.

Chinese researchers reported the findings from a study of blood samples from healthy adults aged between 18-59 in a paper published on Sunday, July 25, which has not been peer reviewed.
Among participants who received two doses, two or four weeks apart, only 16.9% and 35.2% respectively still had neutralizing antibodies above what researchers regard as a detectable threshold level six months after the second shot, the paper said.
Those readings were based on data from two cohorts involving more than 50 participants each, while the study gave third doses of the vaccine or placebo to a total of 540 participants.
Researchers said it was unclear how the decrease in antibodies would affect the shot’s effectiveness, since scientists have yet to figure out precisely the threshold of antibody levels for a vaccine to be able to prevent the disease.
“In the short-to-medium term, ensuring more people complete the current two-dose schedule of CoronaVac should be the priority,” the paper said.
Indonesia and Thailand have already agreed to give a third shot from Moderna and Pfizer respectively for some people who are fully vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine, amid concerns over its effectiveness against the more transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus.
Turkey had started offering a third dose from either Sinovac or Pfizer to some people who have got Sinovac shots.
As of end-June, Sinovac has delivered more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine, a major vaccination tool in China, Brazil, Indonesia and Chile.
Philippine Health Secretary Francisco Duque said on Tuesday there is no recommendation yet from the country’s vaccine expert panel on giving a booster shot but experts are discussing the possibility.
The study also said that participants in some cohorts who received a third dose of the Sinovac shot about six months after the second showed around a 3-5 fold increase in antibody levels after a further 28 days, compared with the levels seen four weeks after the second shot.
Researchers cautioned the study did not test the antibodies’ effect against more transmissible variants, and that further research was needed to assess antibody duration after a third shot.

Fastened to his shoulders, chest, waist, knees and feet, the exoskeleton allows Oscar – who has a genetic neurological condition that means his nerves do not send enough signals to his legs – to walk across the room and turn around.
“Before, I needed someone to help me walk … this makes me feel independent,” said Oscar, as his father Jean-Louis Constanza, one of the co-founders of the company that makes the exoskeleton, looks on.
“One day Oscar said to me: ‘dad, you’re a robotic engineer, why don’t you make a robot that would allow us to walk?'” his father recalls, speaking at the company Wandercraft’s headquarters in Paris.
“Ten years from now, there will be no, or far fewer, wheelchairs,” he said.
Other companies across the world are also manufacturing exoskeletons, competing to make them as light and usable as possible. Some are focused on helping disabled people walk, others on a series of applications, including making standing less tiring for factory workers.
Wandercraft’s exoskeleton, an outer frame that supports but also simulates body movement, has been sold to dozens of hospitals in France, Luxembourg and the United States, for about 150,000 euros ($176,000) a piece, Constanza said.
It cannot yet be bought by private individuals for everyday use – that is the next stage the company is working on. A personal skeleton would need to be much lighter, Wandercraft engineers said.

The study involved 499 medical workers – 100 receiving mixed doses, 200 taking two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and the remainder getting two AstraZeneca shots.
All showed neutralizing antibodies, which prevent the virus from entering cells and replicating, and the result of the mixed schedule of vaccines showed similar amounts of neutralizing antibodies found from the group that received two Pfizer shots.
A British study last month showed similar results – an AstraZeneca shot followed by Pfizer produced the best T-cell responses, and a higher antibody response than Pfizer followed by AstraZeneca.
The data provides further support for the decision of several countries to offer alternatives to AstraZeneca as a second shot after the vaccine was linked to rare blood clots.

Officials say vaccines are highly effective against the Delta variant, now the dominant variant worldwide, though the study reiterated that one shot of the vaccines is not enough for high protection.
The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, confirms headline findings given by Public Health England in May about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca, based on real-world data.
Wednesday’s study found that two doses of Pfizer’s shot was 88% effective at preventing symptomatic disease from the Delta variant, compared to 93.7% against the Alpha variant, broadly the same as previously reported.
Two shots of AstraZeneca vaccine were 67% effective against the Delta variant, up from 60% originally reported, and 74.5% effective against the Alpha variant, compared to an original estimate of 66% effectiveness.
“Only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the Delta variant as compared with the Alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses,” Public Health England researchers wrote in the study.
Data from Israel has estimated lower effectiveness of Pfizer’s shot against symptomatic disease, although protection against severe disease remains high.
PHE had previously said that a first dose of either vaccine was around 33% effective against symptomatic disease from the Delta variant.

A WHO-led team spent four weeks in and around the central city of Wuhan with Chinese researchers and said in a joint report in March that the virus had probably been transmitted from bats to humans through another animal.
It said that “introduction through a laboratory incident was considered to be an extremely unlikely pathway,” but countries including the United States and some scientists were not satisfied.
“We ask China to be transparent and open and to cooperate,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference on Thursday.
“We owe it to the millions who suffered and the millions who died to know what happened,” he said.
China has called the theory that the virus may have escaped from a Wuhan laboratory “absurd” and said repeatedly that “politicizing” the issue will hamper investigations.
At a regular news briefing on Friday, July 16, when asked about Tedros’ comments, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that some data was unable to be copied or leave China as it involved personal information.
Tedros will brief WHO’s 194 member states on Friday regarding a proposed second phase of study, WHO’s top emergency expert Mike Ryan said.
“We look forward to working with our Chinese counterparts on that process and the director-general will outline measures to member states at a meeting tomorrow, on Friday,” he told reporters.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/child-diseases-on-rise-covid-19-slows-routine-vaccinations/,Child diseases on rise as COVID-19 slows routine vaccinations – UN,"Nearly 23 million children missed out on routine vaccinations last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest number in more than a decade, fueling outbreaks of measles, polio, and other preventable diseases, UN agencies said on Thursday, July 15.
Measles, one of the world’s most contagious diseases, can be fatal to children under the age of five, especially in African and Asian countries with weak health systems, according to the World Health Organization. Polio can cripple a child for life.
The gap in global vaccination coverage has set up a “perfect storm,” leaving more children vulnerable to infectious pathogens just as many countries ease COVID-19 restrictions, the WHO and UN Children’s Fund said in an annual report.
Ten countries, led by India and Nigeria, account for the bulk of the 22.7 million children left unvaccinated or under-vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) in 2020 – 3.7 million more than in 2019 and the most since 2009, it said regarding a key indicator of childhood vaccination rates.
“Large and disruptive” outbreaks of measles have been recorded in hotspots including Afghanistan, Mali, Somalia, and Yemen, the report added.
Some 22.3 million children missed their first dose of measles vaccine last year – although there was probably substantial overlap with those lacking DTP coverage – for the lowest coverage against the killer disease since 2010, it said.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has led to major backsliding on childhood vaccination, taking us back more than a decade,” Kate O’Brien, WHO director of immunization, told a news briefing.
There has been an “alarming increase” in “zero dose” children – those missing out on any vaccination – which rose to 17.1 million last year from 13.6 million, said Ephrem Lemango, UNICEF chief of immunization. Many live in war-torn countries or slums, he said.
Sixty-six countries postponed at least one immunization campaign against preventable diseases, although some including Mexico have begun catch-up programs, the report said.
“In 2021 we have potentially a perfect storm about to happen and we don’t want to get to that perfect storm to be ringing the alarm bell. We are ringing it now,” O’Brien said.
The WHO has urged countries not to lift public health and social distancing measures prematurely as they begin to emerge from the pandemic, she said.

Underlining the WHO’s existing stance, the report strongly opposed making modifications to the genetic code in humans that would be passed on to future generations, known as heritable germline genome editing.
“No-one in their right mind should contemplate doing it because the techniques are simply not safe enough or efficient enough and we’re not ready in terms of looking at all the ethical considerations,” said Robin Lovell Badge of Britain’s Francis Crick Institute, a committee member.
But the technology, with the CRISPR/Cas9 ‘genetic scissors’ as its most prominent tool, also holds the promise of curing diseases such as HIV or sickle-cell disease and boosting fundamental medical knowledge, and unequal access could cement global disparities, the panel warned.
“The danger in fully implementing intellectual property as we know it,” would be that rich countries benefit while poor countries bear the main burden of diseases such as sickle cell anaemia, Anne Wangari Thairu-Muigai of Kenja’s Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, told a press briefing.
Intellectual property in medicine became a contested issue when US President Joe Biden in May proposed a temporary waiver of vaccine patents to make anti-COVID-19 shots more quickly available in low-income countries.
Pharmaceutical companies and other countries have argued such a step would be ineffective and risks discouraging work on future health technologies.
Seeking to head off irresponsible human gene modification, the panel also warned it should only be conducted where sufficient policies and oversight are in place, raising the spectre of rogue clinics attracting medical tourism to loosely regulated countries with purported therapies or clinical trials.
Specific rules, however, could be a while in the making as WHO said its Science Division would be given up to 3 years to initiate an extensive review of the recommendations, while the review itself could take as long as 18 months.",Reuters,"Jul 13, 2021 1:39 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/australian-scientists-develop-pain-free-blood-sugar-test-diabetics/,Australian scientists develop pain-free blood sugar test for diabetics,"Australian scientists say they have developed the “holy grail” of blood sugar testing for diabetics, a non-invasive strip that checks glucose levels via saliva.
For diabetics, managing their blood sugar levels typically means pricking their fingers multiple times a day with a lancet and then placing a drop of blood on a testing strip. Understandably, some diabetes sufferers avoid the painful process by minimizing their tests.
However, this latest test works by embedding an enzyme that detects glucose into a transistor that can then transmit the presence of glucose, according to Paul Dastoor, Professor of Physics at the University of Newcastle in Australia, who led the team that created it.
Since the electronic materials in the transistor are inks, the test can be made through printing at a low cost, Dastoor said.
“The holy grail of glucose testing has been something that is non-invasive,” said Dastoor.
“[This test] really does open up the prospect of pain-free, low-cost glucose testing and hopefully much better outcomes for diabetes sufferers,” he said.
The new test, Dastoor said, was created by chance as scientists were working on solar cells.
The project secured A$6.3 million ($4.7 million) in funding from the Australian government to establish a facility to produce the test kits should clinical trials be passed.
Dastoor says the technology could also be transferred to COVID-19 testing and allergen, hormone, and cancer testing.
The university is already working with Harvard University on a test for COVID-19 using same technology, but it’s the implications for other testing that has the physicist excited about the potential for the sensors.
“I think its going to radically change the way we think about medical devices and in particular sensors because we can print these at remarkably low cost,” said Dastoor.",Reuters,"Jul 13, 2021 9:59 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/who-countries-should-not-order-covid-19-boosters-while-others-still-need-vaccines/,WHO says countries should not order COVID-19 boosters while others still need vaccines,"Rich countries should not be ordering booster shots for their vaccinated populations while other countries have yet to receive COVID-19 vaccines, the World Health Organization said on Monday, July 12.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said deaths were again rising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Delta variant was becoming dominant, and many countries had yet to receive enough vaccine doses to protect their health workers.
“The Delta variant is ripping around the world at a scorching pace, driving a new spike in COVID-19 cases and death,” Tedros told a briefing, noting that the highly contagious variant, first detected in India, had now been found in more than 104 countries.
“The global gap in COVID-19 vaccine supply is hugely uneven and inequitable. Some countries and regions are actually ordering millions of booster doses, before other countries have had supplies to vaccinate their health workers and most vulnerable,” said Tedros.
He singled out vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna as companies that were aiming to provide booster shots in countries where there were already high levels of vaccination. Tedros said they should instead direct their doses to COVAX, the vaccine sharing program mainly for middle-income and poorer countries.
The WHO’s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, said the global health body had so far not seen evidence showing that booster shots were necessary for those who have received a full course of vaccines. While boosters may be necessary one day, there was no evidence they were needed yet.
“It has to be based on the science and the data, not on individual companies declaring that their vaccines need to be administered as a booster dose,” she said.
Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s emergencies program, said: “Right now, we are condemning hundreds of millions of people to having no protection.
“We will look back in anger, and we will look back in shame”, if countries use precious doses on booster shots, at a time when vulnerable people are still dying without vaccines elsewhere, Ryan said.
“These are people who want to have their cake and eat it, and then they want to make some more cake and eat it too,” he said.",Reuters,"Jul 13, 2021 12:29 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-biontech-bid-booster-doses-premature-more-data-needed-experts/,"Pfizer-BioNTech bid for booster doses premature, more data needed – experts","Pfizer Inc’s push for health regulators to authorize a third dose of its COVID-19 shot is not yet backed by evidence, despite the fast-spreading Delta variant, vaccine experts said.
Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE said last week that they will ask US and European regulators within weeks to authorize a booster dose due to an increased risk of infection after six months.
The companies did not share the data showing that risk, but said it would soon be made public. A meeting with federal health officials to discuss the matter was scheduled for Monday, July 12, Pfizer said.
In interviews with Reuters, some leading vaccine experts questioned Pfizer’s rationale and said that more data was needed to justify a booster, especially as many countries struggle to administer the initial vaccine doses needed to protect their citizens.
“It’s disappointing that with such a complicated decision they took such a unilateral approach,” said Dr. Larry Corey, a virologist at Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center who is overseeing US-government backed COVID-19 vaccine trials.
The rise of the Delta variant, first detected in India and now the dominant form of new coronavirus infections in many countries, has raised concerns over whether currently available vaccines offer enough protection. Several experts say a booster shot would be warranted if there is a substantial increase in hospitalizations or deaths among vaccinated people.
“That’s the line for boosters,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and an advisor on vaccines to the US Food and Drug Administration.
That has not been the case so far in the United States, where the overwhelming majority of severe illness occurs in unvaccinated people, he said.
Shortly after Pfizer’s announcement late on Thursday,July 8, US health officials sought to reassure the public that anyone who already received two doses of the drugmaker’s vaccine was protected against severe disease and death, even from the Delta variant.
“Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,” the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.
A Pfizer spokesperson declined to comment on the criticism.
Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla and other officials have said for months that they expect a regular booster shot will be needed against COVID-19, a prospect that could help company profits for years to come.
In explaining the decision to seek emergency authorization now, Pfizer cited findings released last week by Israel’s Health Ministry suggesting the vaccine was only 64% effective at preventing transmission and mild disease in the face of the Delta variant. The ministry said it remains 93% effective at preventing hospitalizations and death.
Pfizer’s chief scientific officer, Mikael Dolsten, told Reuters the Israeli data showed that protection had waned in individuals who got the vaccine in January or February.
Pfizer board member Scott Gottlieb told CNBC that those vaccinated included people who are older and who had experienced asymptomatic or mild COVID.
“Frankly you do not want them to get any infection because of the uncertainty of infection in older individuals and how dangerous infection is in older individuals,” he said. “That’s why I believe … boosters will likely be an option for older individuals who were vaccinated a while ago heading into the fall and winter.”
The Israeli Health Ministry, however, has not published any data showing a specific correlation between infections among vaccinated people and the date the vaccine was administered. On Sunday, July 11, the government said it would offer a booster to adults with weak immune systems who are at higher risk for severe COVID.
“I am not aware of valid clinical evidence coming from Israel that establishes a higher risk of breakthrough infection, let alone severe illness, associated with six months or more elapsing from vaccination – not in a methodologically sound analysis suggesting causal association beyond early descriptive hints,” said Ran Balicer of healthcare provider HMO Clalit and chair of the Israeli government’s expert advisory panel on COVID-19.
“I am not saying it could not be the case – but that to date I have not seen such evidence,” he said.
It is not clear at this point what might be causing the drop in efficacy, Corey said. “Is it really due to waning antibody levels, or is it something else?”
The US government is backing two studies of a similar vaccine from Moderna Inc that could shed more light on how the vaccines fare against the Delta variant. Those results are expected in late fall.
Dr. William Schaffner, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said he was encouraged by statements from Pfizer that the company’s own preliminary data show a third vaccine dose produces a fresh spike in antibody levels, in case it will be needed.
“But the argument for a booster right now, I don’t find compelling,” he said.",Reuters,"Jul 12, 2021 7:09 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/unvaccinated-belgian-woman-contract-covid-19-variants/,Unvaccinated Belgian woman contracted 2 COVID-19 variants simultaneously,"A 90-year-old Belgian woman who died from COVID-19 in March had contracted two variants of coronavirus at the same time, which is believed to be the first documented case of its kind, a scientific congress and Belgian media said on Sunday, July 11.
The case, discussed at this year’s European Congress on Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (ECCMID), shows that it is possible to catch two COVID-19 variants simultaneously, the society that organized the congress said in a statement.
The society said the woman became sick with Alpha and Beta types first identified in Britain and South Africa and her doctors said she could have contracted the infections from two different people.
The woman, who was treated at a hospital in Aalst near Brussels, had not been vaccinated, Belgium’s Dutch-language public broadcaster VRT said. Belgium, like much of the European Union, faced vaccine delivery problems early in 2021 and its vaccination program started slowly, although the EU has now delivered vaccines to cover 70% of the population.
The society, citing discussions at the July 9-12 congress, said doctors believe it was the first documented case of its kind and, although rare, similar dual infections are happening.
“Both variants were circulating (in March) in Belgium,” molecular biologist Anne Vankeerberghen of the OLV hospital in Aalst said on VRT’s website.
“It is therefore probable that this woman was infected by two different people with two variants of the virus. Unfortunately, we do not know how this infection happened,” she said.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/do-i-need-a-covid-19-booster-shot/,Do I need a COVID-19 booster shot? 6 questions answered on how to stay protected,"The increasing prevalence of new coronavirus variants is raising questions about how well protected those who’ve already had their COVID-19 shots are against evolving forms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here, microbiology and infectious disease specialist William Petri of the University of Virginia answers some common questions about COVID-19 booster shots.
Boosters are an extra dose of a vaccine given to maintain vaccine-induced protection against a disease. They are commonly used to bolster many vaccines because immunity can wear off over time. For example, the flu vaccine needs a booster every year, and the diphtheria and tetanus vaccine every 10 years.
Boosters are often identical to the original vaccine. In some cases, however, the booster shot has been modified to enhance protection against new viral variants. The seasonal flu vaccine, most notably, requires an annual booster because the flu virus changes so rapidly.
Not yet. As of early July 2021, none of the US government authorities is recommending a booster. This includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to the CDC.
While vaccine-induced immunity may not last forever, it is not clear when a booster will be needed.
Encouragingly, all of the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines induce a robust immune memory against the coronavirus. The vaccine teaches your immune system’s memory B cells to produce antibodies when you’re exposed to the virus. Researchers have detected high levels of memory B cells in the lymph nodes of people who received the Pfizer vaccine for at least 12 weeks after they got the shot.
Studies also suggest that authorized COVID-19 vaccines are continuing to offer protection even against emerging strains of the coronavirus. Among one study’s participants, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had 73% and 82% efficacy 14 days and 28 days post shot, respectively, at warding off severe disease from the beta variant. And a preliminary study that has not been peer-reviewed found the Pfizer vaccine to be 88% effective against the delta variant.
The other source of long-lasting antibody responses against the coronavirus is cells called plasmablasts that reside in bone marrow. These cells continuously produce antibodies and do not require boosting to maintain their activity. Fortunately, plasmablasts have been detected in the bone marrow of people who received the COVID-19 vaccine for up to 11 months, indicating some degree of long-lasting immune memory.
You may need to wait for an outbreak in people who have been vaccinated. Researchers are still figuring out the best way to measure the strength of someone’s vaccine-induced immunity. The COVID-19 vaccines have been so effective that there are not many failures to test.
The best candidate to measure are certain antibodies the vaccine induces the immune system to make. They recognize the spike protein that allows the coronavirus to enter and infect cells. Evidence supporting the importance of anti-spike antibodies includes a study showing that the somewhat more effective mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna generate higher antibody levels in the blood than the adenovirus vector vaccines like Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. In a preliminary study that has not yet been peer-reviewed, anti-spike antibody levels were lower in people who caught COVID-19 after they were vaccinated with the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine.
Medical workers would love to be able to give patients a blood test that would tell them how well protected they are or aren’t against COVID-19. That would be a clear indication as to whether a booster shot is needed.
But until researchers know for sure how to measure vaccine-induced immunity, the next indication that boosters may be needed are breakthrough infections in older adults who have already been vaccinated. People over the age of 80 make lower levels of antibodies after vaccination, so their immunity may wane sooner than that of the general population. The elderly would also most likely be the most susceptible to new viral variants that evade the protection current vaccines provide.
Boosters may be necessary for immunocompromised people. In one study, 39 of 40 kidney transplant recipients and a third of dialysis patients failed to make antibodies after vaccination. Another study identified 20 patients with rheumatic or musculoskeletal diseases on medications that suppress the immune system who also did not have detectable antibodies. Both of these studies were done after patients received the full vaccine dose.
Boosters have been shown to help in these cases. In one study, one-third of solid organ transplant patients who had a suboptimal response to two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines were able to develop an antibody response with a third dose.
Those who are immunocompromised may wonder if the vaccine they received is successfully generating immunity in their body. A preliminary study that has not yet been peer-reviewed did find that a test that specifically targets the anti-spike antibodies the vaccines trigger may be helpful in determining whether the vaccine worked. But for now, the FDA does not recommend antibody tests to assess immunity.
Likely not. Recent research has shown that mRNA vaccines, like Pfizer and Moderna, can be mixed with adenovirus-based vaccines like AstraZeneca with comparable results. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

There is no consensus among scientists yet, however, that a third dose is necessary.
The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain made the Pfizer vaccine available last month as a booster shot to those initially immunized with a vaccine developed by China’s Sinopharm.
The World Health Organization said on Friday, July 9, that it was not clear whether boosters will be needed to maintain protection, until further data is collected.
The following outlines what options countries and regions are considering on the issue:
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on July 8 that Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster COVID-19 shot at this time.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on July 9 it was too early to determine whether more than the two shots would be called for, saying it was confident for now that the established regimen was sufficient.
Recent supply contracts with Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have included the potential for the bloc to buy booster shots.
Britain is starting to plan for a booster campaign starting later this year after top vaccine advisers said it might be necessary to give third shots to the elderly and most vulnerable from September.
There has been no final decision on whether a vaccine booster campaign is needed, but officials had advised that preparations should begin on a precautionary basis.
Britain said it would buy 60 million more doses of Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine ahead of the possible booster program, bringing its total order of the shot to 100 million doses.
Brazilians should prepare for annual COVID-19 immunizations to reinforce vaccines currently available, the head of public-sector laboratory Butantan said in May.
The country has not yet made a decision over the recommendation of a third dose but is expected to do so in August.
A source close to the health ministry said the government was contemplating the possibility of recommending a third dose from the autumn and that authorities were already laying out logistics, liaising with regional health agencies for preparedness.
Such deployment, however, would still need approval from France’s top heath advisory body which has not yet given a position.
The two countries are considering offering a booster shot to their medical workers immunized with China’s Sinovac vaccine.
Israel’s Health ministry said on July 5 that it was not at this stage planning to administer booster shots to the public but that it was considering rolling them out to people with immunosuppressant conditions who displayed a weak response to the original shots.
Health clinics in Moscow started offering booster shots earlier this month to people vaccinated six months ago or more, making Russia one of the first countries to begin re-vaccination.
Singapore said in May it was making plans for booster shots later this year or early next year, if necessary.
South Korea said in June it plans to secure more mRNA vaccines to use as boosters next year for its entire population of 52 million.
Switzerland has ordered 43 million doses of vaccines, including preparations for potential booster shots in 2022, should they be needed, the Federal Health Ministry has said.
The country’s infection rate is considered very low but has been rising as authorities relax restrictions.
Moderna has struck deals with Spain’s Rovi and Switzerland’s Lonza at a Dutch plant that would boost 50-microgram dose production – half the levels of its original shots — in Europe to up to 600 million doses annually, with the capacity due to come on line this year.",Reuters,"Jul 9, 2021 11:12 PM PHT"

Heart conditions myocarditis and pericarditis must be listed as possible side effects of the two mRNA vaccines, the safety committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday, July 9.
Such cases primarily occurred within 14 days from vaccination, more often after the second dose and in younger adult men, the EMA said. This is in line with findings from US health officials last month.
The EMA panel also recommended that people who have a history of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) must not be vaccinated with J&J’s single-shot vaccine. The watchdog in June asked CLS to be added as a side effect from AstraZeneca’s shot.

https://www.rappler.com/technology/study-fitbit-data-lasting-changes-some-covid-19-survivors/,Fitbit data points to lasting changes for some after surviving COVID-19 – study,"A new study published on Wednesday, July 7, on JAMA Network Open found that people who have had COVID-19 took longer to return to their baseline statistics and markers of health compared to those with other diseases.
The study focused on “875 individuals who reported symptoms of an acute respiratory illness and underwent swab testing for COVID-19 and were found to be either positive (234 individuals) or negative (641 individuals).” The study is part of Scripps Research Translational Institute in California’s  DETECT (Digital Engagement and Tracking for Early Control and Treatment) program, which looked into whether wearables, in conjunction with self-reporting of symptoms, can be accurate at identifying COVID-19.
There were a few key measurements that differ between those who had been COVID-19 positive and those who had been negative.
Those with COVID-19 tended to feel a short drop in resting heart rate relative to their baseline after the start of symptoms showing, then had a sustained, elevated heart rate. They also did less physical activity – fewer steps as measured by step counting – and slept less compared to the time prior to the COVID-19 diagnosis.
For COVID-19 positive individuals, it took about 79 days after symptom onset for resting heart rate to return to baseline while step count and sleep quantity took 32 and 24 days, respectively.
The amount of time it took for measurements to return to baseline were unique to COVID-19 as well. Jennifer Radin, an epidemiologist at Scripps leading the DETECT trial, told The New York Times in its report, “There was a much larger change in resting heart rate for individuals who had [COVID-19] compared to other viral infections.”
“We also have a much more drastic change in steps and sleep,” she added.
“Lots of people who get COVID end up getting autonomic dysfunction and a kind of ongoing inflammation, and this may adversely affect their body’s ability to regulate their pulse,” Dr. Radin said.
The study meanwhile cited one limitation, which was that participants did not continue reporting their symptoms timeframe after falling ill.
Said the study, “Symptom data were collected only during the acute phase of infection, which limited our ability to compare long-term physiological and behavioral changes with long-term symptoms.”
A future study hopes to address these concerns by having a larger sample size and longer study phase.
“We want to kind of do a better job of collecting long-term symptoms so we can compare the physiological changes that we’re seeing with symptoms that participants are actually experiencing,” Radin said “So this is really a preliminary study that opens up many other studies down the road.”

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/could-dangerous-new-covid-19-variants-evolve-pets-farm-animals/,Could dangerous new COVID-19 variants evolve in pets and farm animals?,"People have been panicking about COVID-19 in animals since the very start of the pandemic. There’s now plenty of evidence that SARS-CoV-2 – the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 – can cross from humans into other animals. This is known as spillback. The virus is capable of infecting a range of species, from hamsters to gorillas.
Reassuringly, the vast majority of animals do not get as seriously sick from an infection as humans do. Also, at present there are very few documented cases of animals then transmitting infection back to humans. But a new concern is now being discussed: what if SARS-CoV-2 could be replicating unnoticed in animals and mutating? Could new variants emerge that can reinfect humans and create more havoc?
SARS-CoV-2 has been evolving in humans throughout the pandemic, resulting in many new variants arising, and there are two factors that appear to have helped variants emerge. First is the vast number of infections in people worldwide, as the virus has the chance to mutate every time it reproduces. The second is the much smaller number of chronic infections that happen in people whose immune systems aren’t fully functioning. When facing a weak immune system, the virus isn’t quickly wiped out, and so has the time to evolve ways of evading immunity.
Is it possible that these evolution scenarios are also going on in animals, but that we’re unaware of them happening?
To get a sense of whether this is a risk, we first need to know how many infections are occurring in animals. This will help identify any possible hidden reservoir of the virus. To this end, SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals are being studied extensively in many places across the world. Scientists are investigating exactly which species are susceptible to infection, as well as how common the virus is in different animal populations.
To find out which species are susceptible, many different animals – both domesticated and wildlife species – have now been exposed to the virus in experimental settings. This has provided a comprehensive understanding of exactly which animals can be infected – they include cats, ferrets, deer mice, and white-tailed deer. And to find out how common animal infections are, screening for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is also being used to uncover animals that have previously been naturally exposed to the virus.
Most studies of natural infections in animals have focused on cats and dogs, as these are the species that live most closely with humans. A recent UK preprint (a piece of research yet to be reviewed by other scientists) found that only six out of 377 pet dogs and cats tested between November 2020 and February 2021 had antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2.
This shows that infection isn’t rife and going unnoticed among most of our pets. Early results from another study in the Netherlands (which is also still awaiting review) found higher rates of antibodies in the animals it tested (54 out of 308 dogs and cats were positive), but probably due to different sampling strategies. The UK research studied blood samples from a random set of animals, whereas the Dutch study specifically sampled pets in the homes of people known to be infected with COVID-19.
So it’s reasonably safe to say that our household pets are unlikely to be acting as a significant reservoir of ongoing infections that could allow new variants to emerge. But what about other species?
The animal that has raised most concern is mink. The only documented cases of animals spreading SARS-CoV-2 back to people involve these animals. These were first identified in the Netherlands in May 2020 and mink-related variants were identified in Denmark in November 2020. Thankfully, highly effective containment measures have rapidly brought mink infections under control in these areas – but these animals will need to continue to be monitored closely.
What about the other source of virus variants: chronic cases of COVID-19? Could these occur in animals, enabling more virus evolution within a single host?
Typically, chronic SARS-CoV-2 infections occur in people whose immune systems aren’t fully functioning – often because of other medical conditions they have or treatments they are receiving. These immunosuppressed patients therefore receive extensive medical care throughout their infection.
Animals can also be immunosuppressed for a whole range of reasons, but even the most beloved pets rarely undergo the kind of extensive hospitalization that could allow for viral evolution. As for immunosuppression in other animals, such as wildlife, this would be a significant survival disadvantage. It’s unlikely that animals with compromised immune systems would survive long enough for much evolution of an acute virus like SARS-CoV-2 to happen. However, minor mutations have been reported in experimental infections (again in early research awaiting review), suggesting that some evolution is theoretically possible even over a short timeframe.
Moving forwards, it’s essential that we continue surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in all manner of animal populations. Particular focus should be on animals that live more closely with people – it is pets and farmed animals that are more likely to be accidentally exposed to high doses of virus from an infected person. Careful attention must also be paid to wildlife known to be susceptible to infection.
If evidence of natural animal-animal spread or chronic infections in animals arises, then strict control measures must be introduced quickly. At present, there is no need to consider similar blanket control strategies for animals like those used in humans, but we should keep an open mind for the future. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

A WHO group evaluating therapies concluded treating severe and critical COVID patients with these so-called interleukin-6 antagonists that block inflammation “reduces the risk of death and the need for mechanical ventilation.”
According to the WHO analysis, the risk of dying within 28 days for patients getting one of the arthritis drugs with corticosteroids such as dexamethasone is 21%, compared with an assumed 25% risk among those who got standard care. For every 100 such patients, four more will survive, the WHO said.
Moreover, the risk of progressing to mechanical ventilation or death was 26% for those getting the drugs and corticosteroids, compared with 33% in those getting standard care. The WHO said that meant for every 100 such patients, seven more will survive without mechanical ventilation.
“We have updated our clinical care treatment guidance to reflect this latest development,” WHO Health Emergencies official Janet Diaz said.
The analysis covered 10,930 patients, of whom 6,449 got one of the drugs and 4,481 got standard care or a placebo. It was done with King’s College London, University of Bristol, University College London and Guy’s, and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and published on Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The US Food and Drug Administration last week issued emergency use approval for Actemra for COVID-19. That’s after its off-label use in the pandemic drove up sales by around a third to some $3 billion in 2020.
Kevzara sales rose 30% last year, Sanofi reported.
Still, testing Actemra and Kevzara for COVID-19 patients involved trial and error, as several failures emerged as the companies tried out the medicines on different patient groups.
The WHO also called for more to be done to boost access to such medicines in the lowest-income countries now facing surging COVID-19 cases and virus variants, coupled with inadequate vaccine supplies.

Many people as they age suffer from so-called diverticula, or small, bulging sacs that form on the lining of the small or large intestine, but the Pope was among those for whom the problem demanded an operation.
In his case, the Vatican said he suffered from “symptomatic diverticular stenosis”, in which sac-like pouches that protruded from the muscular layer of his colon caused it to narrow. Diverticular disease can cause pain, inflammation and trouble passing stools.
Pope Francis is 84 years old, and age may be a factor since 50% of people over 60 years may develop bulges in the colon, though often without symptoms, according to the US Cleveland Clinic. Still, many develop so-called diverticulitis, whose symptoms include pain, nausea and fever that accompanies inflammation of these bulging sacs.
Some develop stenosis, or narrowing of the colon, that for the Pope required surgical intervention.
It’s not completely clear, but age, diet and lifestyle, and genetics likely play a role, according to Britain’s National Health Service.
As people age, their large intestines’ walls grow weaker, and the pressure of passing hard stools may cause sacs, or diverticula, to form. For some people, smoking, obesity and long-term use of painkillers like ibuprofen or aspirin may contribute to risks, doctors said.
Some people may require antibiotics to resolve an acute case of diverticulitis, and doctors may recommend a high-fiber diet, according to the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
In cases like the stenosis suffered by the Pope, doctors may decide to remove the unhealthy section of the colon, then reconnect the healthy sections.
Typically, the bowel stops working for a few days following surgery. In some cases, doctors can’t rejoin the ends of the colon immediately, so a surgeon does a temporary colostomy before later rejoining the colon’s healthy tissue during a second surgery, the US National Institutes of Health said.
In its statements, the Vatican has not mentioned a colostomy.
People typically go home within 10 days – the Pope plans to stay in Rome’s Gemelli hospital for seven, barring complications, a spokesperson said – but it may take three months to recover fully, according to guidance from the Australian government’s health agency. The Pope always suspends most public activities in July, giving him a month of near-total rest time, and August is also very slow at the Vatican.
Two days after surgery, his spokesman said routine tests were good and that Pope Francis had eaten breakfast and read several newspapers.
The Mayo Clinic advises that a low-fibre diet for years may put people at risk of developing diverticulitis. Lack of exercise may also be a risk factor, though even people who are physically active may develop symptoms.
Eating foods rich in fibre, plus drinking adequate fluids, can be helpful in keeping such conditions from returning, though as many as 60-70% of people who experienced one bout of diverticulitis may see it come back.",Reuters,"Jul 7, 2021 12:11 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/symptoms-delta-variant-appear-differ-traditional-covid-symptoms/,The symptoms of the Delta variant appear to differ from traditional COVID-19 symptoms,"We’ve been living in a COVID world for more than 18 months now. At the outset of the pandemic, government agencies and health authorities scrambled to inform people on how to identify symptoms of the virus.
But as the virus has evolved, it seems the most common symptoms have changed too.
Emerging data suggest people infected with the Delta variant — the variant behind most of Australia’s current cases and highly prevalent around the world — are experiencing symptoms different to those we commonly associated with COVID earlier in the pandemic.
Humans are dynamic. With our differences come different immune systems. This means the same virus can produce different signs and symptoms in different ways.
A sign is something that’s seen, such as a rash. A symptom is something that’s felt, like a sore throat.
The way a virus causes illness is dependent on two key factors:
So when we talk about the signs and symptoms of a virus, we’re referring to what is most common. To ascertain this, we have to collect information from individual cases.
It’s important to note this data is not always easy to collect or analyze to ensure there’s no bias. For example, older people may have different symptoms to younger people, and collecting data from patients in a hospital may be different to patients at a GP clinic.
Using a self-reporting system through a mobile app, data from the United Kingdom suggest the most common COVID symptoms may have changed from those we traditionally associated with the virus.
The reports don’t take into account which COVID variant participants are infected with. But given Delta is predominating in the UK at present, it’s a safe bet the symptoms we see here reflect the Delta variant.
While fever and cough have always been common COVID symptoms, and headache and sore throat have traditionally presented for some people, a runny nose was rarely reported in earlier data. Meanwhile, loss of smell, which was originally quite common, now ranks ninth.
There are a few reasons we could be seeing the symptoms evolving in this way. It may be because data were originally coming mainly from patients presenting to hospital who were therefore likely to be sicker. And given the higher rates of vaccination coverage in older age groups, younger people are now accounting for a greater proportion of COVID cases, and they tend to experience milder symptoms.
It could also be because of the evolution of the virus, and the different characteristics (viral factors) of the Delta variant. But why exactly symptoms could be changing remains uncertain.
While we still have more to learn about the Delta variant, this emerging data is important because it shows us that what we might think of as just a mild winter cold — a runny nose and a sore throat — could be a case of COVID-19.
This data highlight the power of public science. At the same time, we need to remember the results haven’t yet been fully analyzed or stratified. That is, “host factors” such as age, gender, other illnesses, medications, and so on haven’t been accounted for, as they would in a rigorous clinical trial.
And as is the case with all self-reported data, we have to acknowledge there may be some flaws in the results.
Although new viral variants can compromise the effectiveness of vaccines, for Delta, the vaccines available in Australia (Pfizer and AstraZeneca) still appear to offer good protection against symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses.
Importantly, both vaccines have been shown to offer greater than 90% protection from severe disease requiring hospital treatment.
A recent “superspreader” event in New South Wales highlighted the importance of vaccination. Of 30 people who attended this birthday party, reports indicated none of the 24 people who became infected with the Delta variant had been vaccinated. The six vaccinated people at the party did not contract COVID-19.
In some cases infection may still possible after vaccination, but it’s highly likely the viral load will be lower and symptoms much milder than they would without vaccination.
Evidence indicating Delta is more infectious compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 and other variants of the virus is building.
It’s important to understand the environment is also changing. People have become more complacent with social distancing, seasons change, vaccination rates vary — all these factors affect the data.
But scientists are becoming more confident the Delta variant represents a more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 strain.
As we face another COVID battle in Australia we’re reminded the war against COVID is not over and we all have a role to play. Get tested if you have any symptoms, even if it’s “just a sniffle.” Get vaccinated as soon as you can and follow public health advice. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/leaked-memo-raises-thai-concern-about-sinovac-vaccines-efficacy/,Leaked memo raises Thai concern about Sinovac vaccine’s efficacy,"A leaked health ministry document has prompted calls in Thailand for medical staff inoculated against COVID-19 to be given a booster of an mRNA vaccine, after it included a comment that such a move could dent public confidence in Sinovac Biotech’s vaccine.
The internal memo, which included various opinions, was reported by local media and shared widely on social media. It was confirmed by Thai Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul as being authentic.
It included a comment from an unnamed official who recommended authorities do not give a booster shot of Pfizer-BioNTech’s  vaccine to frontline health workers, because such a move would be “admitting that the Sinovac vaccine is not effective”.
Thailand has administered Sinovac’s inactivated virus vaccine to most health workers and its real-world study showed two doses were 95% effective in reducing mortality and severe symptoms. The study showed it was 71% to 91% effective in stopping infection with the Alpha variant.
Sinovac in China did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the vaccine’s efficacy.
The comment in the leaked document prompted calls from prominent Thai health experts, including a top medical council official, to give health workers a Pfizer-BioNTech booster shot.
The hashtag “Give Pfizer to medical personnel” was trending on Thai Twitter with more than 624,000 tweets on Monday.
Senior health official Opas Karnkawinpong told reporters the document was not real, however, contradicting health minister Anutin.
Anutin said the comment on the booster shot was “just an opinion” and there was an expert panel to set vaccine policy.
He said two doses of Sinovac’s vaccine were effective and “deliver results beyond the standard”.
Thai experts have urged the government to use various types of coronavirus vaccine to better protect the population.
It is relying mainly on AstraZeneca’s locally manufactured viral vector vaccine, while authorities say Moderna’s mRNA vaccine will also be available.
Thailand has procured 20 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for future delivery and will this month receive 1.5 million doses donated by the United States.
World Health Organization experts found the Sinovac vaccine was efficacious in preventing COVID-19 in adults under 60, but some quality data on the risk of serious adverse effects was lacking.",Reuters,"Jul 5, 2021 9:50 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/delta-variant-sweeps-asia-prompting-curbs-vaccination-remains-tepid/,"Delta variant sweeps Asia, prompting curbs as vaccination remains tepid","The highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus is surging through Asia this week, with record numbers of infections in Australia and South Korea, prompting some countries to tighten curbs and others to hasten vaccination.
The variant, first detected in India in December last year, has spread to about 100 countries and the World Health Organization warned recently that it could soon become the dominant form of the virus. It is also driving a spike in cases in Japan, casting a pall over this month’s Olympic Games.
On Friday, July 2, Australia’s New South Wales state, its most populous, reported the biggest daily rise in new cases so far this year. Total cases in the state in the latest outbreak have topped 200, a majority caused by the Delta variant.
Sydney, home to a fifth of the country’s 25 million population, is half-way through a two-week lockdown to contain the outbreak, which has alarmed authorities amid a sluggish nationwide vaccination drive.
“I think the vaccine will certainly reduce the disease, it will certainly reduce hospitalization. But we’ll certainly have the virus circulating in the community for those people who aren’t vaccinated,” said Professor Jill Carr, a virologist with the College of Medicine and Public Health at Flinders University.
Australia, like several other countries in Asia, has struggled to inoculate people as initial successes in containing the pandemic led to vaccine hesitancy, and manufacturers were slow to ship doses.
Australia has fully vaccinated only 6% of its population, while Japan has vaccinated 12%.
Japan reported on Wednesday that the Delta variant now accounts for nearly a third of all cases in the eastern part of the country, including Tokyo, and that could grow to 50% by mid July.
Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures are among areas under a ‘quasi’ state of emergency set to run through July 11 and the recent uptick in infections has officials leaning towards keeping restrictions in place, government sources have told Reuters.
On Friday, Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike reiterated that a ban on spectators for the Olympic Games, which start on July 23, would be an option if the coronavirus situation worsened.
In South Korea, officials said on Friday daily coronavirus cases topped 800, the highest in nearly six months, with vaccination below 10%. The average number of new infections in the country has risen for 10 days straight, and authorities in Seoul have delayed relaxing social distancing measures.
“The Delta variant is a strain that is most optimized for widespread transmissions,” said Chun Eun-mi, a respiratory disease specialist at Ewha Womans University Medical Center in Seoul.
“The cases of Indonesia, India and Britain show that not just Korea but many other countries will need to rethink their vaccine strategy and reopening plans,” she said.
Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most populous country, imposed emergency measures that begin on Saturday, July 3, until July 20 to contain a spike in cases.
In India, the number of new infections has eased to two-month lows since hitting a peak of 400,000 a day in May, with the government focusing on mass vaccinations.
The United States has also seen a rise in Delta variant infections in parts of the country where vaccination rates remain low, and the White House said on Thursday it would send special assistance to those hot spots.
Europe, too, is battling an increase in infections, which the WHO has blamed on crowds at Euro 2020 football stadiums. It has warned that a new wave was inevitable if people did not remain disciplined.
Britain is gearing up to lift lockdown restrictions on July 19, even as Delta variant cases rise. Germany said on Thursday it expects the variant to account for up to 80% of infections this month and Portugal imposed night-time curfews.
The fresh cases have put a damper on summer tourism in the continent, although the launch of a European Union COVID-19 travel certificate may prompt more travel.
Europe’s drug regulator said on Thursday the COVID-19 vaccines approved in the European Union offered protection against all coronavirus variants, including Delta.
In Asia, international tourism is largely suspended.
The exception is Thailand’s tourist isle of Phuket, which reopened on Thursday to fully vaccinated travellers from overseas in a step towards reviving a battered industry.
Still, Thailand on Friday reported the third straight day of record coronavirus deaths. The Alpha variant, first detected in the United Kingdom, is still the dominant variant in the country, although authorities said they expect the Delta variant to dominate in the next few months.
“In Bangkok it is nearly 40%, within this month or next, it will all be Delta,” said Kumnuan Ungchusak, adviser to the health ministry.
“If this keeps going we cannot survive,” he said referring to the rising death count.",Reuters,"Jul 2, 2021 11:48 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-shows-promise-against-delta-variant/,J&J’s COVID-19 vaccine shows promise against Delta variant,"Johnson & Johnson said late Thursday, July 1, that its single-shot COVID-19 vaccine showed strong promise against the Delta variant and other emerging strains and also provided durable protection against the infection more broadly.
Data showed that the durability of immune response for recipients of its vaccine lasted at least eight months, the healthcare company said, adding that its vaccine was 85% effective and could also help prevent hospitalization and death.
First identified in India, Delta is becoming the globally dominant variant of the coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization.
“Current data for the eight months studied so far shows that the single-shot Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine generates a strong neutralizing antibody response that does not wane; rather, we observe an improvement over time,” Mathai Mammen, head of research & development at J&J’s drugs business, said in the statement.
Recipients of the vaccine produced strong neutralizing antibodies against all variants including the Delta, the US-based company said.
The Delta variant contributed to a surge in COVID-19 cases in India that resulted in the highest daily death tally in the world, and also prompted the UK to delay its reopening by one month in June.
J&J has submitted data as a preprint to the website bioRxiv ahead of peer review.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pets-often-catch-covid-19-from-humans-study/,"Sick as a dog? Pets often catch COVID-19 from humans, study finds","If you think you have COVID-19, it might be best to stay away from your pets, says the author of a Dutch study that found a surprising number of dogs and cats may be getting infected.
“About one out of five pets will catch the disease from their owners,” said Els Broens of Utrecht University in the Netherlands, although there are no known cases of the disease spreading from pets to humans.
“Luckily, the animals do not get very ill from it.”
In Broens’ study, presented this week in a paper at the European Congress of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, 156 dogs and 154 cats from 196 households were tested in homes where humans were known to have had a coronavirus infection.
About 17% of the animals, 31 cats and 23 dogs, had antibodies for COVID-19, suggesting they had been infected.
In addition, six cats and seven dogs, or 4.2% of the animals, had an active infection as shown by a PCR test.
Later testing showed those animals recovered quickly and did not pass it on to other pets in the same household, Broens said.
COVID-19 is thought to originate in bats and it has been known since the first months of the pandemic that non-human mammals can be infected, but few become seriously ill.
Only minks are known to have been infected by humans and then passed the disease on to other humans.
Broens said the affection owners have for their cats and dogs may play a role in the pets’ high infection rates.
“A lot of the pet owners are in very close contact, like they sleep with their animals in their bed, so you can imagine that there’s close contact, so that transmission can take place,” she said.",Reuters,"Jul 2, 2021 10:23 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/curevac-covid-19-vaccine-records-low-efficacy-final-trial-readout/,CureVac COVID-19 vaccine records only 48% efficacy in final trial readout,"CureVac said its COVID-19 vaccine was 48% effective in the final analysis of its pivotal mass trial, only marginally better than the 47% reported after an initial read-out two weeks ago.
The German biotech firm said that efficacy, measured by preventing symptomatic disease, was slightly better at 53% when excluding trial participants older than 60 years, an age group that is by far the most severely affected.
CureVac said on June 16 its COVID-19 vaccine, known as CVnCoV, proved only 47% effective in an initial trial read-out and that new variants had proved a headwind, denting investor confidence in its ability to take on rival shots.
That wiped billions of euros from its market value.
Wednesday’s news sent US-listed shares of the company 10.2% lower to $66 after the bell.
Late-stage trials of BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which like CureVac’s are based on mRNA technology, had efficacy rates of well above 90% across all age groups but took place when the original version of the coronavirus was dominant.
Data on their products have, however, so far suggested only somewhat weaker protection against new variants.
The CureVac study, which involved about 40,000 adult volunteers in Europe and Latin America, showed that efficacy was 77% in the age group below 60 years of age when considering only moderate to severe symptoms and excluding mild cases.
CureVac said it had sent the data to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as part of an ongoing dialogue with the EU drugs regulator.
CureVac previously said that the regulatory hurdle was 50% efficacy in principle but that various other considerations would come into play.
“In this final analysis, CVnCoV demonstrates a strong public health value in fully protecting study participants in the age group of 18 to 60 against hospitalization and death and 77% against moderate and severe disease – an efficacy profile, which we believe will be an important contribution to help manage the COVID-19 pandemic and the dynamic variant spread,” said Chief Executive Officer Franz-Werner Haas.
CureVac had registered 228 infections overall for the final analysis, after 134 cases for the interim analysis.
Public health representatives across the globe are pushing for a fast deployment of available vaccines to counter highly contagious mutations of COVID-19 such as the Delta variant that first emerged in India.
The EMA has said it would not impose a 50% efficacy threshold for vaccines and that full trial data was necessary for it to make a sound assessment on the benefits and risks of a shot.
Under CureVac’s only major supply deal for the product tested in the trial, the European Union secured up to 405 million doses of the vaccine in November, of which 180 million are optional.
In a bet on CureVac’s technology, Britain placed a conditional 50 million dose order in February on yet-to-be-developed vaccines that build on the product tested in the trial.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/heart-inflammation-after-covid-19-shots-higher-than-expected-study-united-states-military/,Heart inflammation after COVID-19 shots higher-than-expected in study of US military,"Members of the US military who were vaccinated against COVID-19 showed higher-than-expected rates of heart inflammation, although the condition was still extremely rare, according to a study released on Tuesday, June 29
The study found that 23 previously healthy males with an average age of 25 complained of chest pain within 4 days of receiving a COVID-19 shot. The incident rate was higher than some previous estimates would have anticipated, it said.
All the patients, who at the time of the study’s publication had recovered or were recovering from myocarditis – an inflammation of the heart muscle –had received shots made by either Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE or Moderna Inc.
US health regulators last week added a warning to the literature that accompanies those mRNA vaccines to flag the rare risk of heart inflammation seen primarily in young males. But they said the benefit of the shots in preventing COVID-19 clearly continues to outweigh the risk.
The study, which was published in the JAMA Cardiology medical journal, said 19 of the patients were current military members who had received their second vaccine dose. The others had either received one dose or were retired from the military.
General population estimates would have predicted 8 or fewer cases of myocarditis from the 436,000 male military members who received two COVID-19 shots, the study said.
An outside panel of experts advising the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said last week that reports of myocarditis were higher in males and in the week after the second vaccine dose than would be anticipated in the general population. A presentation at that meeting found the heart condition turned up at a rate of about 12.6 cases per million people vaccinated.
Eight of the military patients in the study were given diagnostic scans and showed signs of heart inflammation that could not be explained by other causes, the study said. The patients in the study ranged from ages 20 to 51.
The CDC began investigating the potential link between the mRNA vaccines and myocarditis in April after Israel flagged that it was studying such cases in people who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine there, and after a report that the US. military had also found cases.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/immune-response-astrazeneca-shot-boosted-mixing-dose-schedule-with-pfizer/,Immune response of AstraZeneca shot boosted by mixing dose schedule with Pfizer – study,"A mixed schedule of vaccines where a shot of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine is given 4 weeks after a AstraZeneca shot will produce better immune responses than giving another dose of the AstraZeneca shot, an Oxford study said on Monday, June 28.
The study, called Com-COV, compared mixed two-dose schedules of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines, and found that in any combination, they produced high concentrations of antibodies against the coronavirus spike protein.
The data provides support for the decision of some European countries that have started offering alternatives to AstraZeneca as a second shot after the vaccine was linked to rare blood clots.
Matthew Snape, the Oxford professor behind the trial, said that the findings could be used to give flexibility to vaccine rollouts, but was not large enough to recommend a broader shift away from clinically approved schedules on its own.
“It’s certainly encouraging that these antibody and T-cell responses look good with the mixed schedules, but I think your default has to stay, unless there’s a very good reason otherwise, to what is proven to work,” he told reporters.
The highest antibody response was seen in people receiving two doses of Pfizer vaccine, with both mixed schedules producing better responses than two doses of AstraZeneca vaccine.
An AstraZeneca shot followed by Pfizer produced the best T-cell responses, and also a higher antibody response than Pfizer followed by AstraZeneca.
