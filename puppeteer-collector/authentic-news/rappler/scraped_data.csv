https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/oxford-covid-vaccine-produces-strong-immune-response-after-third-booster-shot/,Oxford COVID vaccine produces strong immune response after 3rd booster shot – study,"A third shot of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine produces a strong immune response, researchers said on Monday, June 28, adding there was not yet evidence that such shots were needed, especially given shortages in some countries.
The Oxford University study found that a third dose of the vaccine increases antibody and T-cell immune responses, while the second dose can be delayed up to 45 weeks and also lead to an enhanced immune response.
The British government has said it is looking at plans for an autumn vaccine booster campaign, with three-fifths of adults already having received both doses of a COVID vaccine.
Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said that evidence that the vaccine protects against current variants for a sustained period of time meant that such a booster may not be needed.
“We do have to be in a position where we could boost if it turned out that was necessary … (but) we don’t have any evidence that that is required,” he told reporters.
“At this point with a high level of protection in the UK population and no evidence of that being lost, to give third doses now in the UK whilst other countries have zero doses is not acceptable.”
Studies had previously shown that the shot, invented at Oxford University and licensed to AstraZeneca has higher efficacy when the second dose is delayed to 12 weeks instead of 4 weeks.
Monday’s research was released in a preprint, and looked at 30 participants who received a late second dose and 90 who received a third dose, all of whom were under 55.
It helps assuage concerns that viral vector COVID vaccines, such as those made by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, may lose their potency if annual inoculations are needed due to the risk that the body produces an immune response against the vectors that deliver the vaccine’s genetic information.
“There had been some concerns that we would not be able to use this vaccine in a booster vaccination regime, and that’s certainly not what the data is suggesting,” study author Teresa Lambe of Oxford’s Jenner Institute told Reuters.",Reuters,"Jun 28, 2021 8:10 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-recommends-sinovac-vaccine-for-children-aged-12-17/,Indonesia recommends Sinovac vaccine for children aged 12-17,"Indonesia’s food and drug agency has recommended the COVID-19 vaccine made by China’s Sinovac Biotech for children aged 12-17, the country’s COVID-19 task force said, as the country seeks to extend inoculations amid a surge in infections.
Indonesia has reported record daily rises in cases of more than 20,000 recently after the emergence of virus variants and travel after the Muslim fasting month has helped drive a new wave of infections.
Task force spokesman Wiku Adisasmito welcomed the food and drug agency’s (BPOM) recommendation and said “the government invites the people to still wait for the issuance of emergency use approval from BPOM.”
Penny K. Lukito, the head of BPOM, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the timing of such a ruling.
Indonesia has been using Sinovac as the main plank for its vaccination program after receiving about 94 million doses, while it has received about 10 million made by AstraZeneca and Sinopharm.
Task force data shows children aged 0-18 account for 12.6% of Indonesia’s total COVID-19 infections.
The World Health Organization (WHO) approved emergency use of Sinovac’s vaccine this month, saying results showed it prevented symptomatic disease in 51% of recipients and prevented severe COVID-19 and hospital stays.
The Southeast Asian country is under pressure to speed up vaccinations with hospitals in several designated “red zone” reporting overcapacity and with 93% of isolation beds in Jakarta occupied as of Sunday, June 27.
Indonesia reported it had given 1.3 million vaccine shots on Saturday, the highest daily count since the program began in January. About 13.18 million people have received both shots as of Monday, government data showed.",Reuters,"Jun 28, 2021 7:24 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-vaccines-why-important-get-second-dose/,COVID-19 vaccines: Why it’s important you get your 2nd dose,"Vaccination is the safest way to gain immunity to the coronavirus, and with most COVID-19 vaccines, you need two doses to get the greatest possible protection.
Immunologists call this method of giving people multiple doses “prime-boosting.” Essentially, you first teach the immune system what it is looking for – you prime it with the first vaccination. Then, after the immune system has had time to respond to the priming, it is challenged again. The immune response learned the first time is boosted when put into practice on the second exposure.
Most (though not all) vaccines – COVID-19 or otherwise – use prime-boosting to maximize protection. Some even require further doses. This is because immunity can wane over time or, as is the case with the flu vaccine, the virus that causes the disease can change so that the original vaccine no longer provides good protection.
With COVID-19, we have strong evidence that taking a second dose increases your defense against the disease. Despite this, one in 40 people in the UK who have had a first dose don’t seem to be getting their second. In the US, there have been reports of millions of people skipping their second doses. In doing so, these people are endangering their health.
The benefits of prime-boosting with COVID-19 vaccines were initially seen in clinical trials. Early studies of the currently approved COVID-19 vaccines compared the immune responses in people who received one or two vaccine doses. Results showed that after the second dose, people had higher amounts of antibodies to fight the virus, indicating that taking more than one dose would probably increase vaccine effectiveness.
Larger clinical trials then continued with this prime-boosting regimen. With the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, protection against symptomatic COVID-19 was found to be 52% from 12 days after the first dose (immunity takes time to build). Protection then rose to 95% after the second dose.
With the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, protection against symptomatic COVID-19 from 22 days after the first dose was estimated to be 76%. When a second dose was given 12 weeks after the first, it raised protection to 81%.
With the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines across many countries worldwide, we’re now getting real-world data that confirms the benefits of prime-boosting that were recorded in trials. A recent British preprint – a piece of research not yet reviewed by other scientists – found that from 21 days after the first vaccine dose, coronavirus infections were reduced by 66% in people receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and by 61% in those taking the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. But in people who had also taken second doses, these reductions then fell further to 80% and 79% respectively.
There’s also now an extra reason you should get your second dose: new coronavirus variants of concern. These are forms of the coronavirus that have genetic mutations that may make them more transmissible, less susceptible to the protective effects of vaccines, harder to detect, or cause more severe disease.
From late 2020, the UK struggled against the Alpha variant, a more transmissible form of the virus that became dominant over winter. This variant has since been out-competed by the Delta variant, an even more transmissible form of the virus that is now dominant instead.
A new lab-based study suggests that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine provides protection against currently circulating variants, including Alpha and Delta. However, it also found that after only one dose, the ability of the vaccine to combat different variants varies significantly.
The scientists investigated the antibody responses of 250 people vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against five variants of the coronavirus, including the original “wild type” that spread in early 2020 as well as the Alpha and Delta variants and several other forms. After the first and second dose, the researchers looked to see whether people had antibodies able to prevent infection – called neutralizing antibodies – for these different forms of the virus.
In individuals who had received only one dose of the vaccine, neutralizing antibody levels for the Delta variant were significantly lower than for the Alpha variant. That is to say, the research suggested that a single dose might still afford more protection than no vaccination, but that people who had only had a single dose would be less well protected than they were before the Delta variant had emerged.
Critically, these laboratory results appear to be reflected in the real world. A preprint from Public Health England suggests that after one dose, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines are 50% protective against symptomatic disease caused by the Alpha variant but only 33% protective against the Delta variant. To stress, against the newly dominant variant in the UK, a single vaccine dose is less likely to stop you from getting ill.
Yet after two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the paper suggests protection against symptomatic COVID-19 rises to 93% against the Alpha variant and 88% for the Delta variant. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine also sees a lift: after a second dose it’s 66% protective against Alpha and 60% effective against Delta.
The importance of having two doses is even more evident when looking at hospitalization rates for COVID-19. Another recent preprint from Public Health England suggests that protection against needing hospital treatment for COVID-19 caused by the Delta variant goes up from 94% with one dose to 96% with two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The difference is even more marked for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, with protection rising from 71% to 92% with a second dose.
Although these findings are yet to be formally published, the evidence is strong that getting a second vaccine dose raises your protection against getting ill and developing serious illness. Meanwhile, the new dominance of the Delta variant has also made the lower protection offered by a single dose even lower than it was before. Making that second trip to the vaccine clinic is therefore critically important. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/johnson-johnson-pay-opioid-settlement-avoid-trial/,"J&J to pay $263 million in New York opioid settlements, avoids trial","Johnson & Johnson said on Saturday, June 26, it will pay $263 million to resolve claims it fueled an opioid epidemic in New York state and two of its largest counties.
The settlements remove the drugmaker from a jury trial scheduled to begin on Tuesday, June 29, on Long Island, where several big opioid makers and distributors are also defendants.
Johnson & Johnson did not admit liability or wrongdoing in settling with New York state, and with Nassau and Suffolk counties. The $229.9 million state settlement also calls for J&J to stop selling the painkillers nationwide.
“The opioid epidemic has wreaked havoc” across the nation, New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “Johnson & Johnson helped fuel this fire.”
She said her focus remains “getting funds into communities devastated by opioids as quickly as possible.”
J&J said the settlements were consistent with its prior agreement to pay $5 billion to settle opioid claims by states, cities, counties, and tribal governments nationwide.
The healthcare company and the largest US drug distributors – AmerisourceBergen Corp., Cardinal Health Inc., and McKesson Corp. – have proposed paying a combined $26 billion to end thousands of opioid lawsuits.
J&J has also been appealing an Oklahoma judge’s 2019 ruling that the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company pay that state $465 million for its deceptive marketing of opioids.
Tuesday’s opioids trial is one of several scheduled for this year, with others underway in California and West Virginia.
Drugmakers AbbVie Inc. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and several distributors are among the defendants. Pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. is also a defendant, though it was sued only by the counties.
Walmart Inc., Rite Aid Corp., and CVS Health Corp. were severed from the trial during jury selection. CVS has settled with Nassau and Suffolk counties. Settlement terms have not been disclosed.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/study-covid-19-china-origin-estimates/,First COVID-19 case could have emerged in China in October 2019 – study,"The virus that causes COVID-19 could have started spreading in China as early as October 2019, two months before the first case was identified in the central city of Wuhan, a new study showed on Friday, June 25.
Researchers from Britain’s University of Kent used methods from conservation science to estimate that SARS-CoV-2 first appeared from early October to mid-November 2019, according to a paper published in the PLOS Pathogens journal.
The most likely date for the virus’s emergence was Nov. 17, 2019, and it had probably already spread globally by January 2020, they estimated.
China’s first official COVID-19 case was in December 2019 and was linked to Wuhan’s Huanan seafood market.
However, some early cases had no known connection with Huanan, implying that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating before it reached the market.
A joint study published by China and the World Health Organization at the end of March acknowledged there could have been sporadic human infections before the Wuhan outbreak.
In a paper released in preprint form this week, Jesse Bloom of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle recovered deleted sequencing data from early COVID-19 cases in China.
The data showed that samples taken from the Huanan market were “not representative” of SARS-CoV-2 as a whole, and were a variant of a progenitor sequence circulating earlier, which spread to other parts of China.
The US National Institutes of Health confirmed to Reuters that the samples used in the study were submitted to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) in March 2020 and later deleted at the request of Chinese investigators, who said they would be updated and submitted to another archive.
Critics said the deletion was further evidence that China was trying to cover up the origins of COVID-19.
“Why would scientists ask international databases to delete key data that informs us about how COVID-19 began in Wuhan?” said Alina Chan, a researcher with Harvard’s Broad Institute, writing on Twitter.
Another study by Australian scientists, published on Thursday in the Scientific Reports journal, used genomic data to show SARS-CoV-2 binds to human receptors far more easily than other species, suggesting it was already adapted to humans when it first emerged.
It said it was possible there was another unidentified animal with even stronger affinity that served as an intermediary species, but the hypothesis that it leaked from the lab could not be ruled out.
“While it is clear early viruses had a high propensity for human receptors, that doesn’t mean they were ‘man-made’,” said Dominic Dwyer, infectious disease expert at Australia’s Westmead Hospital who was part of the WHO team investigating COVID-19 in Wuhan this year.
“Such conclusions remain speculative,” he said.
Serum samples still needed to be tested to make a stronger case about COVID-19’s origins, said Stuart Turville, associate professor at the Kirby Institute, an Australian medical research organisation who was responding to the University of Kent study.
“Unfortunately with the current pressure of the lab leak hypothesis and the sensitivities in doing this follow-up research in China, it may be some time till we see reports like that,” he said.",Reuters,"Jun 25, 2021 12:22 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-estimates-covid-19-boosters-needed-yearly-most-vulnerable/,WHO estimates COVID-19 boosters needed yearly for most vulnerable,"The World Health Organization (WHO) forecasts that people most vulnerable to COVID-19, such as the elderly, will need to get an annual vaccine booster to be protected against variants, an internal document seen by Reuters shows.
The estimate is included in a report, which is to be discussed at a board meeting of Gavi, a vaccine alliance that co-leads the WHO’s COVID-19 vaccine program COVAX. The forecast is subject to changes and is also paired with two other less likely scenarios.
Vaccine makers Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc, with its German partner BioNTech, have been vocal in their view that the world will soon need booster shots to maintain high levels of immunity, but the evidence for this is still unclear.
The document shows that the WHO considers annual boosters for high-risk individuals as its “indicative” baseline scenario, and boosters every two years for the general population.
It does not say how these conclusions were reached, but shows that under the base scenario new variants would continue to emerge and vaccines would be regularly updated to meet these threats.
The UN agency declined to comment on the content of the internal document.
A spokesperson for Gavi said COVAX was planning to take a wide range of scenarios into consideration.
The document, which is dated June 8 and is still a “work in progress,” also predicts under the base case that 12 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses will be produced globally next year.
That would be slightly higher than the forecast of 11 billion doses for this year cited by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA), signaling that the UN agency does not expect a significant ramp-up of vaccine production in 2022.
The document predicts manufacturing problems, regulatory approval issues and “transition away from some technology platforms” as potential drags on supplies next year.
It does not signal which technologies could be phased out, but the European Union, which has reserved the world’s largest volume of COVID-19 vaccines, has bet heavily on shots using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, such as those by Pfizer and Moderna, and has forgone some purchases of viral vector vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson.
The scenarios will be used to define the WHO’s global vaccination strategy and the forecasts may change as new data emerges on the role of boosters and the duration of vaccine protection, Gavi says in another document, also seen by Reuters.
So far about 2.5 billion doses have been administered worldwide, mostly in rich countries where over half of the population has received at least one dose, whereas in many poorer countries less than 1% has been vaccinated, according to Gavi’s estimates.
This gap could widen next year under the WHO’s most pessimistic forecast, as the need for annual boosters could once again push poorer nations to the back of the queue.
In its worst-case scenario, the UN agency says production would be 6 billion doses next year, due to stringent regulation for new shots and manufacturing issues with existing ones.
That could be compounded by the need for annual boosters for the entire world, and not just the most vulnerable, to combat variants and limited duration of protection.
In the more optimistic situation, all vaccines in the pipeline would get authorised and production capacity would ramp up to about 16 billion doses to meet demand. Vaccines would also be shared equitably across the world.
There would be no need for boosters as vaccines would show strong efficacy against variants and long protection.",Reuters,"Jun 25, 2021 8:47 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/explainer-things-to-know-about-delta-variant-coronavirus/,EXPLAINER: What is the Delta variant of coronavirus with K417N mutation?,"India said on Wednesday, June 23, it has found around 40 cases of the Delta coronavirus variant carrying a mutation that appears to make it more transmissible, and advised states to increase testing.
Below is what we know about the variant.
The variant, called “Delta Plus” in India, was first reported in a Public Health England bulletin  on June 11.
It is a sub-lineage of the Delta variant first detected in India and has acquired the spike protein mutation called K417N which is also found in the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.
Some scientists worry that the mutation, coupled with other existing features of the Delta variant, could make it more transmissible.
“The mutation K417N has been of interest as it is present in the Beta variant (B.1.351 lineage), which was reported to have immune evasion property,” India’s health ministry said in a statement.
Shahid Jameel, a top Indian virologist, said the K417N was known to reduce the effectiveness of a cocktail of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.
As of June 16 , at least 197 cases has been found from 11 countries – Britain (36), Canada (1), India (8), Japan (15), Nepal (3), Poland (9), Portugal (22), Russia (1), Switzerland (18), Turkey (1), the United States (83).
India said on Wednesday around 40 cases of the variant have been observed in the states of Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh, with “no significant increase in prevalence”. The earliest case in India is from a sample taken on April 5.
Britain said its first 5 cases were sequenced on April 26 and they were contacts of individuals who had travelled from, or transited through, Nepal and Turkey.
No deaths were reported among the UK and Indian cases.
Studies are ongoing in India and globally to test the effectiveness of vaccines against this mutation.
“WHO is tracking this variant as part of the Delta variant, as we are doing for other Variants of Concern with additional mutations,” the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement sent to Reuters.
“For the moment, this variant does not seem to be common, currently accounting for only a small fraction of the Delta sequences … Delta and other circulating Variants of Concern remain a higher public health risk as they have demonstrated increases in transmission,” it said.
But India’s health ministry warned that regions where it has been found “may need to enhance their public health response by focusing on surveillance, enhanced testing, quick contact-tracing and priority vaccination.”
There are worries Delta Plus would inflict another wave of infections on India after it emerged from the world’s worst surge in cases only recently.
“The mutation itself may not lead to a third wave in India – that also depends on COVID-appropriate behaviour, but it could be one of the reasons,” said Tarun Bhatnagar, a scientist with the state-run Indian Council for Medical Research.",Reuters,"Jun 24, 2021 12:16 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/study-astrazeneca-pfizer-vaccines-effective-delta-covid-19-variants/,"AstraZeneca, Pfizer vaccines effective vs Delta COVID-19 variants – study","COVID-19 vaccines made by AstraZeneca and the Pfizer-BioNTech alliance remain broadly effective against Delta and Kappa variants of the COVID-19 causing virus, which were first identified in India, according to a scientific study, underpinning a continued push to deliver the shots.
The study by Oxford University researchers, published in the journal Cell, investigated the ability of antibodies in the blood from people, who were vaccinated with the two-shot regimens, to neutralize the highly contagious Delta and Kappa variants, a statement said.
“There is no evidence of widespread escape suggesting that the current generation of vaccines will provide protection against the B1617 lineage,” the paper said, referring to the Delta and Kappa variants by a commonly used code.
However, the concentration of neutralizing antibodies in the blood was somewhat reduced, which may lead to some breakthrough infections, they cautioned.
Last week, an analysis by the Public Health England (PHE) showed that vaccines made by Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca offer high protection of more than 90% against hospitalization from the Delta variant.
“We are encouraged to see the non-clinical results published from Oxford and these data, alongside the recent early real-world analysis from Public Health England, provide us with a positive indication that our vaccine can have significant impact against the Delta variant,” AstraZeneca executive Mene Pangalos said in a separate statement.
The Delta variant is becoming the globally dominant version of the disease, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist said on Friday, June 18.
The Oxford researchers also analyzed reinfection patterns in people who had previously had COVID-19. The risk of reinfection with the Delta variant appeared particularly high in individuals previously infected by the Beta and Gamma lineages that emerged in South Africa and Brazil, respectively.
By contrast, previous infection with the Alpha, or B117, variant first detected in Britain, conferred “reasonable” cross-protection against all variants of concern, lending itself as a template that next-generation vaccines could be molded on.
“B117 might be a candidate for new variant vaccines to provide the broadest protection,” the researchers said.",Reuters,"Jun 23, 2021 6:04 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/global-herd-immunity-out-of-reach-inequitable-vaccine-distribution/,Global herd immunity remains out of reach because of inequitable vaccine distribution,"In the race between infection and injection, injection has lost.
Public health experts estimate that approximately 70% of the world’s 7.9 billion people must be fully vaccinated to end the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 21, 2021, 10.04% of the global population had been fully vaccinated, nearly all of them in rich countries.
Only 0.9% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose.
I am a scholar of global health who specializes in healthcare inequities. Using a data set on vaccine distribution compiled by the Global Health Innovation Center’s Launch and Scale Speedometer at Duke University in the United States, I analyzed what the global vaccine access gap means for the world.
Supply is not the main reason some countries are able to vaccinate their populations while others experience severe disease outbreaks – distribution is.
Many rich countries pursued a strategy of overbuying COVID-19 vaccine doses in advance. My analyses demonstrate that the US, for example, has procured 1.2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses, or 3.7 doses per person. Canada has ordered 381 million doses; every Canadian could be vaccinated five times over with the two doses needed.
Overall, countries representing just one-seventh of the world’s population had reserved more than half of all vaccines available by June 2021. That has made it very difficult for the remaining countries to procure doses, either directly or through COVAX, the global initiative created to enable low- to middle-income countries equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.
Benin, for example, has obtained about 203,000 doses of China’s Sinovac vaccine – enough to fully vaccinate 1% of its population. Honduras, relying mainly on AstraZeneca, has procured approximately 1.4 million doses. That will fully vaccinate 7% of its population. In these “vaccine deserts,” even front-line health workers aren’t yet inocculated.
Haiti has received about 461,500 COVID-19 vaccine doses by donations and is grappling with a serious outbreak.
Even COVAX’s goal – for lower-income countries to “receive enough doses to vaccinate up to 20% of their population” – would not get COVID-19 transmission under control in those places.
Last year, researchers at Northeastern University modeled two vaccine rollout strategies. Their numerical simulations found that 61% of deaths worldwide would have been averted if countries cooperated to implement an equitable global vaccine distribution plan, compared with only 33% if high-income countries got the vaccines first.
Put briefly, when countries cooperate, COVID-19 deaths drop by approximately in half.
Vaccine access is inequitable within countries, too – especially in countries where severe inequality already exists.
In Latin America, for example, a disproportionate number of the tiny minority of people who’ve been vaccinated are elites: political leaders, business tycoons, and those with the means to travel abroad to get vaccinated. This entrenches wider health and social inequities.
The result, for now, is two separate and unequal societies in which only the wealthy are protected from a devastating disease that continues to ravage those who are not able to access the vaccine.
This is a familiar story from the HIV era.
In the 1990s, the development of effective antiretroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS saved millions of lives in high-income countries. However, about 90% of the global poor who were living with HIV had no access to these lifesaving drugs.
Concerned about undercutting their markets in high-income countries, the pharmaceutical companies that produced antiretrovirals, such as Burroughs Wellcome, adopted internationally consistent prices. Azidothymidine, the first drug to fight HIV, cost about $8,000 a year – over $19,000 in today’s dollars.
That effectively placed effective HIV/AIDS drugs out of reach for people in poor nations – including countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the epidemic’s epicenter. By the year 2000, 22 million people in sub-Saharan Africa were living with HIV, and AIDS was the region’s leading cause of death.
The crisis over inequitable access to AIDS treatment began dominating international news headlines, and the rich world’s obligation to respond became too great to ignore.
“History will surely judge us harshly if we do not respond with all the energy and resources that we can bring to bear in the fight against HIV/AIDS,” said South African President Nelson Mandela in 2004.
Pharmaceutical companies began donating antiretrovirals to countries in need and allowing local businesses to manufacture generic versions, providing bulk, low-cost access for highly affected poor countries. New global institutions like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria were created to finance health programs in poor countries.
Pressured by grassroots activism, the United States and other high-income countries also spent billions of dollars to research, develop and distribute affordable HIV treatments worldwide.
It took over a decade after the development of antiretrovirals, and millions of unnecessary deaths, for rich countries to make those lifesaving medicines universally available.
Fifteen months into the current pandemic, wealthy, highly vaccinated countries are starting to assume some responsibility for boosting global vaccination rates.
Leaders of the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, European Union and Japan recently pledged to donate a total of 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to poorer countries.
It is not yet clear how their plan to “vaccinate the world” by the end of 2022 will be implemented and whether recipient countries will receive enough doses to fully vaccinate enough people to control viral spread. And the late 2022 goal will not save people in the developing world who are dying of COVID-19 in record numbers now, from Brazil to India.
The HIV/AIDS epidemic shows that ending the coronavirus pandemic will require, first, prioritizing access to COVID-19 vaccines on the global political agenda. Then wealthy nations will need to work with other countries to build their vaccine manufacturing infrastructure, scaling up production worldwide.
Finally, poorer countries need more money to fund their public health systems and purchase vaccines. Wealthy countries and groups like the G-7 can provide that funding.
These actions benefit rich countries, too. As long as the world has unvaccinated populations, COVID-19 will continue to spread and mutate. Additional variants will emerge.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/which-covid-19-vaccine-best-why-hard-answer/,Which COVID-19 vaccine is best? Here’s why that’s really hard to answer,"With the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines accelerating, people are increasingly asking: which vaccine is best?
Even if we tried to answer this question, defining which vaccine is “best” is not simple. Does that mean the vaccine is better at protecting you from serious disease? The one that protects you from whichever variant is circulating near you? The one that needs fewer booster shots? The one for your age group? Or is it another measure entirely?
Even if we could define what’s “best,” it’s not as if you get a choice of vaccine. Until a suite of vaccines become available, the vast majority of people around the world will be vaccinated with whichever vaccine is available. That’s based on available clinical data and health authorities’ recommendations, or by what your doctor advises if you have an underlying medical condition. So the candid answer to which COVID vaccine is “best” is simply the one available to you right now.
Still not convinced? Here’s why it’s so difficult to compare COVID vaccines.
You might think clinical trials might provide some answers about which vaccine is “best,” particularly the large phase 3 trials used as the basis of approval by regulatory authorities around the world.
These trials, usually in tens of thousands of people, compare the number of COVID-19 cases in people who get the vaccine, versus those who get a placebo. This gives a measure of efficacy, or how well the vaccine works under the tightly controlled conditions of a clinical trial.
And we know the efficacy of different COVID vaccines differ. For instance, we learned from clinical trials that the Pfizer vaccine reported an efficacy of 95% in preventing symptoms, whereas AstraZeneca had an efficacy of 62-90%, depending on the dosing regime.
But direct comparison of phase 3 trials is complex as they take place at different locations and times. This means rates of infection in the community, public health measures, and the mix of distinct viral variants can vary. Trial participants can also differ in age, ethnicity, and potential underlying medical conditions.
One way we can compare vaccine efficacy directly is to run head-to-head studies. These compare outcomes of people receiving one vaccine with those who receive another, in the same trial.
In these trials, how we measure efficacy, the study population, and every other factor is the same. So we know any differences in outcomes must be down to differences between the vaccines.
For instance, a head-to-head trial is under way in the UK to compare the AstraZeneca and Valneva vaccines. The phase 3 trial is expected to be completed later this year.
Until we wait for the results of head-to-head studies, there’s much we can learn from how vaccines work in the general community, outside clinical trials. Real-world data tells us about vaccine effectiveness (not efficacy).
And the effectiveness of COVID vaccines can be compared in countries that have rolled out different vaccines to the same populations.
For instance, the latest data from the UK show both Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have similar effectiveness. They both reliably prevent COVID-19 symptoms, hospitalization and death, even after a single dose.
So what at first glance looks “best” according to efficacy results from clinical trials doesn’t always translate to the real world.
The COVID vaccine you get today is not likely to be your last. As immunity naturally wanes after immunization, periodic boosters will become necessary to maintain effective protection.
There is now promising data from Spain that mix-and-matching vaccines is safe and can trigger very potent immune responses. So this may be a viable strategy to maintain high vaccine effectiveness over time.
In other words, the “best” vaccine might in fact be a number of different vaccines.
Variant viruses have started to circulate, and while current vaccines show reduced protection against these variants, they still protect.
Companies, including Moderna, are rapidly updating their vaccines to be administered as variant-specific boosters to combat this.
So, while one vaccine might have a greater efficacy in a phase 3 trial, that vaccine might not necessarily be “best” at protecting against future variants of concern circulating near you.
It is entirely rational to want the “best” vaccine available. But the best vaccine is the one available to you right now because it stops you from catching COVID-19, reduces transmission to vulnerable members of our community, and substantially reduces your risk of severe disease.
All available vaccines do this job and do it well. From a collective perspective, these benefits are compounded. The more people get vaccinated, the more the community becomes immune (also known as herd immunity), further curtailing the spread of COVID-19.
The global pandemic is a highly dynamic situation, with emerging viral variants of concern, uncertain global vaccine supply, patchy governmental action, and potential for explosive outbreaks in many regions.
So waiting for the perfect vaccine is an unattainable ambition. Every vaccine delivered is a small but significant step towards global normality. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/biontech-shots-stronger-antibody-response-sinovac/,BioNTech shots have stronger antibody response than Sinovac – Hong Kong study,"People who are vaccinated against COVID-19 with BioNTech’s vaccine were found to have “substantially higher” levels of antibodies than those who received Sinovac’s jab, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday, June19, citing a Hong Kong study.
Some who received the Sinovac vaccine might need a third booster shot as well, the newspaper said, citing lead researcher Professor Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist with the University of Hong Kong (HKU).
The government-commissioned study was conducted by HKU’s school of public health and involved tracking the antibody responses of 1,000 people who received either vaccine, the report added.
Earlier this week, officials in Indonesia warned that more than 350 medical workers have caught COVID-19 despite being vaccinated with Sinovac and dozens have been hospitalized, raising concerns about its efficacy against more infectious variants of the virus.
Earlier in June, Uruguay released real-world data on the impact of Sinovac Biotech’s COVID-19 vaccine among its population that showed it was over 90% effective in preventing intensive care admissions and deaths.
The Uruguay government also studied the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine among 162,047 health workers and people over 80 years old, and said the shot was 94% effective at preventing intensive care unit admissions and deaths, and reduced infections by 78%.",Reuters,"Jun 19, 2021 1:26 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/delta-covid-19-variant-becoming-globally-dominant/,"Delta COVID-19 variant becoming globally dominant, WHO official says","The Delta variant of COVID-19, first identified in India, is becoming the globally dominant variant of the disease, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist said on Friday, June 18.
Soumya Swaminathan also voiced disappointment in the failure of CureVac’s vaccine candidate in a trial to meet the WHO’s efficacy standard, in particular as highly transmissible variants boost the need for new, effective shots.
Britain has reported a steep rise in infections with the Delta variant, while Germany’s top public health official predicted it would rapidly become the dominant variant there despite rising vaccination rates.
The Kremlin blamed a surge in COVID-19 cases on reluctance to have vaccinations and “nihilism” after record new infections in Moscow, mostly with the new Delta variant, fanned fears of a third wave.
“The Delta variant is well on its way to becoming the dominant variant globally because of its increased transmissibility,” Swaminathan told a news conference.
Coronavirus variants were cited by CureVac when the German company this week reported its vaccine proved only 47% effective at preventing disease, shy of the WHO’s 50% benchmark.
The company said it documented at least 13 variants circulating within its study population.
Given that similar mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and BioNTech and Moderna posted efficacy rates topping 90%, Swaminathan said the world had been expecting more from CureVac’s candidate.
“Just because it’s another mRNA vaccine, we cannot presume all mRNA vaccines are the same, because each one has a slightly different technology,” Swaminathan said, adding the surprise failure underscored the value of robust clinical trials to test new products.
WHO officials said Africa remains an area of concern, even though it accounts for only around 5% of new global infections and 2% of deaths.
New cases in Namibia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Rwanda have doubled in the last week, WHO emergencies program head Mike Ryan said, while vaccine access remains miniscule.
“It’s a trajectory that is very, very concerning,” Ryan said. “The brutal reality is that in an era of multiple variants, with increased transmissibility, we have left vast swathes of the population, the vulnerable population of Africa, unprotected by vaccines.”",Reuters,"Jun 18, 2021 11:17 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/countries-weigh-mix-match-covid-19-vaccines/,Countries weigh ‘mix and match’ COVID-19 vaccines,"A growing number of countries are looking at switching to different COVID-19 vaccines for second doses or booster shots amid supply delays and safety concerns that have slowed their vaccination campaigns.
Several medical studies to test the efficacy of switching COVID-19 vaccines are underway.
The following are countries that are weighing, or have decided to adopt, such a solution:
Bahrain said on June 4 that eligible candidates could receive a booster shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech or the Sinopharm vaccine, regardless of which shot they had initially taken.
The country’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization said on June 17 that the provinces should offer recipients of a first dose of AstraZeneca’s vaccine a different shot for their second dose, CBC News reported.
The committee had said earlier this month that people first injected with an AstraZeneca shot could choose to receive a different vaccine for their second dose.
Italy’s medicine agency AIFA said on June 14 that people under the age of 60 who were inoculated with a first dose of the AstraZeneca shot can receive a different second shot.
Russia may start trials on a COVID-19 vaccine combining its Sputnik V vaccine and various Chinese shots in Arab countries, the Interfax news agency quoted Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund as saying on June 4.
The RDIF also said that no negative side-effects were found during clinical trials combining COVID-19 vaccine using the AstraZeneca and Sputnik V shots, Interfax reported.
South Korea said on June 18 that some 760,000 people who were inoculated with a first dose of AstraZeneca’s will receive Pfizer’s jab as a second shot due to shipment delays by global vaccine sharing scheme COVAX.
Health Minister Carolina Darias said on May 19 Spain would allow people under 60 who received an AstraZeneca shot first to get a second dose of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine, after preliminary results of a study by the state-backed Carlos III Health Institute.
The United Arab Emirates have made the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine available as a booster shot to those initially immunized with a vaccine developed by the China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm).
A representative of Mubadala Health, part of the state fund, said a different vaccine could be provided as a booster shot but this was at the recipient’s discretion and health professionals did not make recommendations.
Novavax said on May 21 it would take part in a mix-and-match vaccine trial starting in June in the United Kingdom to test the use of an additional vaccine dose from a different producer as a booster.
The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) said on June 1 it had started a clinical trial on fully vaccinated adults to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster shot of a different vaccine.",Reuters,"Jun 18, 2021 4:30 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/first-patient-receives-controversial-biogen-alzheimers-drug/,1st patient receives controversial Biogen Alzheimer’s drug,"A US hospital on Wednesday, June 16, gave the first infusion of an expensive, controversial new Alzheimer’s drug from Biogen Inc before Medicare had even said what it will pay for – and with some doctors upset by its approval last week.
Mark Archambault, a 70-year-old realtor from Wakefield, Rhode Island, was the first patient treated with the drug, Aduhelm, outside of a clinical trial. His infusion took place in Providence at Butler Hospital’s Memory and Aging Program.
“We are opening a new era in treatment,” Brown University Medical School neurology professor Dr. Stephen Salloway told Reuters. He said the Butler Hospital program has around 100 patients likely to be good candidates for the drug, which is given as a monthly intravenous infusion.
Aduhelm was approved based on evidence that it can reduce brain plaques, a likely contributor to Alzheimer’s, rather than proof that it slows progression of the fatal mind-wasting disease.
The US Food and Drug Administration approved the drug – despite the strong objection of its own expert advisory panel – for all patients with Alzheimer’s, although Aduhelm has only been tested for patients in the early stages of the disease.
“Hopefully clinicians will follow the clinical trial guidelines, because we really don’t have any evidence for more advanced patients with Alzheimer’s,” Salloway said.
Some doctors are wary even of prescribing Aduhelm for that group.
Dr. David Knopman, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota was one of three experts who resigned from the panel of advisors which had recommended that the FDA not approve Biogen’s drug.
Between questionable trial results and potential side effects, Knopman did not see reason for most patients to get the medicine. He said he is walking a line between being paternalistic and honest about his concerns to patients as Mayo prepares to treat them with the new drug.
“I may have talked one person out of” using it, he said. “I will turn over some of the responsibility to this team of people we are putting together. They will get my opinion.”
Biogen has estimated around 1.5 million of the 6 million people in the United States with Alzheimer’s would be considered to have early-stage disease.
Cigna Corp Chief Clinical Officer Steve Miller said he expects Cigna, as well as other health insurers and Medicare, will only agree to cover the drug for patients with early Alzheimer’s.
Biogen, which is partnered on the drug with Japanese drugmaker Eisai Co Ltd, has set an average price of $56,000 a year, which the Alzheimer’s Association – a longtime outspoken supporter of Biogen – called “simply unacceptable.”
The vast majority of patients will be covered by the federal Medicare health program. But Robert Egge, chief public policy officer at the Alzheimer’s Association, said most Medicare recipients are responsible for 20% of the cost of drugs given by doctors, and about 10% of them have no cap on those costs.
“This could further exacerbate health equity challenges that we have across the country,” he said.
Biogen said it hoped the “value-based contract” it agreed to with Cigna last week that will track the drug’s effectiveness was a step toward “efficient and affordable patient access.” It added that patients with Medicare fee-for-service were presumed to be automatically covered.
Salloway said Butler Hospital would ask Medicare to cover the costs of Archambault’s treatment. “I am very happy to have this,” the patient said in a webcast news conference.
The US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said it will have more information on coverage soon.
The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), an influential drug pricing research group, has said trial data for Aduhelm, known chemically as aducanumab, indicate a cost-effective price of no more than $8,300 per year. Looking only at favorable trial results – one of two pivotal aducanumab trials failed – that price rises as high as $23,100, ICER said.
After discounts, Biogen’s net price for Aduhelm is likely to be around $30,000 per year, Oppenheimer analyst Jay Olson said in a research note. In addition to those costs, patients must have tests to diagnose Alzheimer’s such as a brain scan, which is not covered by Medicare, or tests using spinal fluid.
Still, given that this is the first approved drug that might slow the lethal, memory-robbing condition, hospitals are gearing up. “All the major centers that have an interest in Alzheimer’s disease are taking this seriously,” Salloway said.",Reuters,"Jun 17, 2021 9:11 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/curevac-fails-covid-19-vaccine-trial-efficacy/,CureVac fails in pivotal COVID-19 vaccine trial with 47% efficacy,"German biotech CureVac NV said on Wednesday, June 16, its COVID-19 vaccine was only 47% effective in a late-stage trial, missing the study’s main goal and throwing in doubt the potential delivery of hundreds of millions of doses to the European Union.
The disappointing efficacy of the shot known as CVnCoV emerged from an interim analysis based on 134 COVID-19 cases in the study with about 40,000 volunteers in Europe and Latin America.
The stakes for CureVac and prospective buyers of its vaccine in Europe had risen after age limits were imposed on the use of the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines due to a link to extremely rare but potentially fatal clotting disorders.
CureVac’s shot was also expected to help in low and middle-income countries that have lagged far behind richer nations in the global immunization drive.
As CureVac’s only major supply deals, the European Union in November secured up to 405 million doses of the vaccine, of which 180 million are optional. That was followed by a memorandum of understanding with Germany for another 20 million doses.
CureVac’s US traded shares fell 50.6% to $46.81 in after-hours trading following publication of the data.
The company said at least 13 virus variants accounted for the infections among the study population.
Out of the reported COVID-19 cases in the trial, 124 were sequenced to identify the variant causing the infection, it said. One case was attributable to the original version of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that emerged in Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, while 57% of the cases were caused by more highly transmissible so-called variants of concern.
The company added that the interim results suggest the vaccine is effective in younger participants but did not prove efficacy in those above age 60, the age group most at risk for severe COVID-19.
“While we were hoping for a stronger interim outcome, we recognize that demonstrating high efficacy in this unprecedented broad diversity of variants is challenging. As we are continuing toward the final analysis with a minimum of 80 additional cases, the overall vaccine efficacy may change,” said Chief Executive Franz-Werner Haas.
Dr. Amesh Adalja, in infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the variants did not completely explain the efficacy number and he still wants to see data specifically about CureVac’s ability to stop serious disease, hospitalization, and death.
“If it can do that, even with a 47% efficacy in symptomatic disease, that’s still a very valuable thing. That’s all we’ve ever wanted vaccines to do,” he said.
Dr. Peter Hotez, a virologist and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said it was not clear if the issue was variant-specific or the vaccine’s inability to create high levels of neutralizing antibodies.
Since starting out in 2000, Tuebingen-based CureVac has focused on so-called messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which is also behind the success of BioNTech and partner Pfizer as well as Moderna, whose vaccines have proved more than 90% effective in preventing illness.
Prior to the emergence of the highly effective vaccines, the US Food and Drug Administration had targeted at least 50% efficacy, which CureVac has fallen short of in the interim analysis. The World Health Organization had said it was looking for at least 70% efficacy.
While late-stage trials of the BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were conducted when the original version of the virus was dominant, real-world data has so far suggested only somewhat weaker protection against the new variants.
CureVac, which is backed by investors Dietmar Hopp, the Gates Foundation and GlaxoSmithKline, as well as the German government, had aimed to produce up to 300 million doses of the vaccine in 2021 and up to 1 billion doses in 2022.
Manufacturing partners include Celonic Group of Switzerland, Novartis, Bayer, Fareva, Wacker, and Rentschler Biopharma SE.
GSK has agreed to collaborate with CureVac on production as well as on development of the next-generation vaccines. A company spokesman said early, preclinical data indicated a 10-fold increase in immunogenicity versus the first.
“We aim for availability of a second-generation COVID-19 vaccine as early as the second half of 2022, subject to regulatory approvals,” he said.",Reuters,"Jun 17, 2021 8:41 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/regeneron-covid-19-therapy-cuts-deaths-hospitalized-patients-lack-antibodies-study/,Regeneron COVID-19 therapy cuts deaths among hospitalized patients who lack antibodies – study,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s COVID-19 antibody cocktail reduces deaths in hospitalized patients who have not mounted their own antibody response, a large British study published on Wednesday, June 16, found.
The therapy, REGEN-COV, has been granted emergency use authorization for people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in the United States, but results from the RECOVERY trial provide the clearest evidence of its effectiveness among hospitalized patients.
It found that the antibody therapy reduced by a fifth the 28-day mortality of people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 whose immune system had not mounted an antibody response, known as seronegative.
The result translates into six fewer deaths for every 100 seronegative patients treated with the therapy, researchers said.
There was no discernible effect of the treatment on those who had generated natural antibody responses and were seropositive.
“People have been very, very skeptical, that any treatment against this particular virus would work by the time people get in hospital,” Martin Landray, the joint chief investigator on the trial, told reporters.
“If you haven’t raised antibodies of your own, you really would benefit from getting some,” he said.
The treatment also shortened the hospital stay of those who were seronegative and reduced their chances of needing a mechanical ventilator, Landray said.
Regeneron had previously said its treatment had shown enough promise in hospitalized patients to warrant continuing its trial. This data provides the first large-scale confirmation of that assertion.
There were 9,785 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus the antibody combination therapy or just usual care, of which 30% were seronegative.
The RECOVERY trial also showed the steroid dexamethasone and Roche’s arthritis drug Actemra (tocilizumab) cut deaths in hospitalized patients.
While those treatments focus on inflammation caused by reaction to the coronavirus, Regeneron’s therapy, which belongs to a class of biotech drugs called monoclonal antibodies, mimic natural antibodies the body produces to fight off the infection.
“This is the first time we’ve got one that’s actually targeting the virus itself,” Landray said, adding that it could be used along with the other treatments.
“It’s not that you do one thing or another thing. These benefits are additive in these patients,” he said.
Other companies have been developing similar treatments.
US emergency use authorization has been granted to antibody treatments developed by Eli Lilly and Co as well as by Vir Biotechnology Inc with GlaxoSmithKline Plc. Both are approved for use in mild-to-moderate cases.
On Tuesday, June 15, AstraZeneca said its antibody therapy had shown no evidence of protecting people from developing the disease following exposure, although other trials of its cocktail as a prevention or a treatment are ongoing.
Landray said the RECOVERY results should give developers of other monoclonal antibody therapies optimism that they can also be used in some hospitalized patients.
“This opens up the possibility for many, many others,” he said.
“People see a few negative trials and they say ‘well that’ll never work’ and they opt out and go off and do something else. (But) this is very, very clear, the picture that we’ve got from this trial.”",Reuters,"Jun 16, 2021 2:08 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-lab-leak-hypothesis-plausible-accidents-happen/,The COVID-19 lab-leak hypothesis is plausible because accidents happen,"At the conclusion of the G7 summit, leaders called for a fresh and transparent investigation to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic began.
I welcome the renewed interest in the potential “lab-leak” origins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It wouldn’t be the first time an infectious pathogen was accidentally released from a research laboratory.
I know from personal experience. Back in 1994, on my first day of a fellowship at Stanford University, I picked up a damp courier parcel at reception and took it back to the lab. My professor put on latex gloves immediately. The parcel contained a vial with an HIV-infected lymph node.
The dry ice used to pack the sample had evaporated, soaking the cardboard. There I was, someone who had not worked with HIV before, with hands damp from handling a box containing live virus.
I didn’t get infected. But the experience left me acutely aware of how easily accidents happen. A 2018 review found 27 cases of laboratory-acquired infections between 1982 and 2016 in the Asia-Pacific region alone. The list of pathogens included everything from the virus that causes dengue fever to the SARS coronavirus.
The American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) maintains a searchable database of reported laboratory-acquired infections. It documents “leakage from the plastic bag in the negative-pressure transport chamber” and exposure to “droplets when cleaning a spill,” among many other examples.
From a scientific perspective alone, it is important to investigate the lab-leak hypothesis because, if true, we have to tighten safety procedures to prevent future leaks.
When the virus was first reported from Wuhan almost 18 months ago, people have raised the possibility that it emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where research on SARS coronaviruses was underway.
This lab-leak hypothesis comes in two flavors. First, the virus could have jumped from an animal (or animal tissue) infected with a SARS coronavirus as part of the research. The infected person subsequently infected others in the community.
The transfer of a pathogen from an animal to people is called a zoonotic transmission. This process also occurs outside of laboratories, perhaps when there is close contact with infected animals or they are eaten.
The second hypothesis suggests a purposeful genetic modification of a coronavirus that gave rise to a more infectious and human-transmissible variant, which then leaked into the community. This type of genetic modification is called gain-of-function, because the engineered virus acquires new biological traits.
It is unfortunate these hypotheses have been miscast as somehow equivalent, and often portrayed as alternative to the “natural origins” hypothesis.
When I and other computational biologists think of origins, we think about evolutionary ancestors: a virus’ evolutionary line of descent. If SARS-CoV-2 had evolved without human intervention from an ancestral variant found in one or more hosts, it is quite possible that such a host animal, or a sample from an infected host animal, was the subject of study in a lab.
Through some unfortunate misadventure, it is plausible that someone in that lab became infected.
Arguments for or against these hypotheses are often couched in terms of likelihoods. In February, the World Health Organisation (WHO) listed four scenarios in its global study of SARS-CoV-2 origins: direct zoonotic transmission, indirect zoonotic transmission through an intermediate host, transmission through cold/food-chain products, and accidental laboratory release.
Indirect zoonotic transmission through an intermediate host was deemed “likely to very likely” and accidental lab release “extremely unlikely.” The WHO panel rejected deliberate gain-of-function manipulation because it “has been ruled out by other scientists following analyses of the genome.”
But that wasn’t the last word, because the exact origin of the COVID-19 virus remains a mystery.
Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has shown the virus is related (about 96%) to a strain found in horseshoe bats. Although this seems like a high level of similarity, it implies that SARS-CoV-2 diverged from this strain several decades ago. Therefore, it remains unclear if the spillover was directly to humans or through an intermediate species.
In any case, such evolutionary analysis cannot distinguish between transmission in or outside a laboratory.
The WHO panel considered a lab-acquired infection as extremely unlikely because of the Wuhan laboratories’ strict biosafety protocols. But the ABSA database lists accidental infections happening even in labs with the highest biosafety accreditation, and these include SARS-coronavirus infections.
In its arguments for and against accidental lab release, the WHO report noted the Wuhan laboratories moved to a new location near the Huanan market in early December 2019, but “reported no disruptions or incidents caused by the move.” There is no reason to distrust the WHO panel’s conclusions, but it is nonetheless true that lab relocations present opportunities for error.
The lab-leak hypothesis is at least plausible and it’s therefore important to investigate it. If it were related to the operations of the lab, or its relocation, we need to re-examine safety protocols. For relocations, we may want to require independent monitoring and pre- and post-move quarantine of essential personnel. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/astrazeneca-antibody-cocktail-fails-prevent-covid-19-symptoms-trial/,AstraZeneca antibody cocktail fails to prevent COVID-19 symptoms in large trial,"AstraZeneca said on Tuesday, June 15, a late-stage trial failed to provide evidence that its COVID-19 antibody therapy protected people who had contact with an infected person from the disease, a small setback in its efforts to find alternatives to vaccines.
The study assessed whether the therapy, a cocktail of two types of antibodies, could prevent adults who had been exposed to the virus in the past eight days from developing COVID-19 symptoms.
The therapy, AZD7442, was 33% effective in reducing the risk of people developing symptoms compared with a placebo, but that result was not statistically significant – meaning it might have been due to chance and not the therapy.
The Phase III study, which has not been peer reviewed, included 1,121 participants in the United Kingdom and the United States. The vast majority, though not all, were free of the virus at the start of the trial.
Results for a subset of participants who were not infected to begin with was more encouraging but the primary analysis rested on results from all participants.
“While this trial did not meet the primary endpoint against symptomatic illness, we are encouraged by the protection seen in the PCR negative participants following treatment with AZD7442,” AstraZeneca Executive Vice President Mene Pangalos said in a statement.
The company is banking on further studies to revive the product’s fortunes. Five more trials are ongoing, testing the antibody cocktail as treatment or in prevention.
The next one will likely be from a larger trial testing the product in people with a weakened immune system due to cancer or an organ transplant, who may not benefit from a vaccine.
AZD7442 belongs to a class of drugs called monoclonal antibodies which mimic natural antibodies produced by the body to fight off infections.
Similar therapies developed by rivals Regeneron and Eli Lilly have been approved by US regulators for treating unhospitalized COVID patients.
European regulators have also authorized Regeneron’s therapy and are reviewing those developed by partners GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology as well as by Lilly and Celltrion.
Regeneron is also seeking US authorization for its therapy as a preventative treatment.
But the AstraZeneca results are a small blow for the drug industry as it tries to find more targeted alternatives to COVID-19 inoculations, particularly for people who may not be able to get vaccinated or those who may have an inadequate response to inoculations.
The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker, which has faced a rollercoaster of challenges with the rollout of its COVID-19 vaccine, is also developing new treatments and repurposing existing drugs to fight the virus.
AstraZeneca also said on Tuesday it was in talks with the US government on “next steps” regarding a $205 million deal to supply up to 500,000 doses of AZD7442. Swiss manufacturer Lonza was contracted to produce AZD7442.
Shares in the company were largely unchanged on the London Stock Exchange.
The full results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal, the company said.",Reuters,"Jun 15, 2021 6:59 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-effective-us-trial/,Novavax COVID-19 vaccine more than 90% effective in US trial,"Novavax Inc on Monday, June 14, said its COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective, including against a variety of concerning variants of the coronavirus in a large, late-stage US-based clinical trial.
The study of nearly 30,000 volunteers in the United States and Mexico puts Novavax on track to file for emergency authorization in the United States and elsewhere in the third quarter of 2021, the company said.
The protein-based vaccine was more than 93% effective against the more easily transmissible predominant coronavirus variants that have caused concern among scientists and public health officials, Novavax said.
Protein-based vaccines are a conventional approach that use purified pieces of the virus to spur an immune response, such as those used against whooping cough and shingles.
While the trial was being conducted, the virus variant first discovered in the United Kingdom and now known as the Alpha variant was the most common circulating in the United States, the company said.
The concerning variants first identified in Brazil, South Africa and India were also detected among the trial’s participants, Novavax’s head of research and development, Dr. Gregory Glenn, told Reuters.
The vaccine was 91% effective among volunteers at high risk of severe infection and 100% effective in preventing moderate and severe cases of COVID-19. It was roughly 70% effective against virus variants that Novavax was unable to identify, Glenn said.
“Practically speaking, it’s very important that the vaccine can protect against a virus that is wildly swinging around” in terms of new variants, Glenn said.
Novavax said the vaccine was generally well tolerated. Side effects included headache, fatigue and muscle pain and were generally mild. A small number of participants experienced side effects described as severe.
Novavax remains on track to produce 100 million doses per month by the end of the third quarter of 2021 and 150 million doses per month in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company said.
Chief Executive Stanley Erck told CNBC on Monday it is possible the United States could donate the 110 million shots Novavax has agreed to supply to the US government to the COVAX program that provides COVID-19 vaccines to poorer countries.
The Maryland-based company has repeatedly pushed back production forecasts and has struggled to access raw materials and equipment needed to manufacture its vaccine.
However, in a May investor call, Erck said major manufacturing hurdles have been cleared and that all of its facilities can now produce COVID-19 vaccine at commercial scale.
Erck said Novavax has begun its regulatory filing in India in partnership with the Serum Institute of India (SII), which is contracted to make Novavax shots.
Erck said his understanding is that SII is no longer constrained by raw materials shortages.
SII had said in March that US restrictions on exports of supplies used for vaccines were limiting its ability to scale up production.

Foam used to dampen the machines’ sound can when it degrades turn into small, inhaled particles, irritating airways, the group said as it announced the recall. Gases released by the degrading foam may also be toxic or carry cancer risks.
Philips Chief Executive Frans van Houten said between three and four million sleep apnea machines and ventilators would be targeted.
The group took a second 250 million euro ($303 million) charge for the issue after announcing an identical provision in its first quarter-earnings report in April, bringing the total cost of the problem to 500 million euros to date.
Shares in the group were down 4.2% to 44.43 euros by 0757 GMT in Amsterdam.
“We’re going to put all our capacity to focus entirely on replacing and repairing these units,” Van Houten said in a call. He said the process would likely take a year.
That “has a consequence that we will not be able to serve new customers, so there’s going to be a shortage in the field”.
The company’s guidance is for users of so-called CPAP machines, which help people with sleep apnea, to halt usage. Around two-thirds of Philips CPAP machines are sold in the United States.
Doctors with patients using life-sustaining ventilators should first consider whether the potential danger from the foam outweighs other risks, the company said.
Philips said that though the matter would cause “revenue headwinds” in the division making the devices, that would be compensated by strength in other businesses.
It left its full-year financial guidance of “low-to-mid-single-digit” comparable sales growth unchanged.
Philips spokesman Steve Klink said the company was working with health authorities on a safe replacement for the foam, but must first clear testing and regulatory hurdles.
In April Philips said first-quarter core earnings surged 74% to 362 million euros compared with the same period a year earlier, on a 9% rise in comparable sales.",Reuters,"Jun 14, 2021 4:16 PM PHT"

Alexander Gintsburg, who heads the Gamaleya Institute that developed Sputnik V, said the spray for children used the same vaccine “only instead of a needle, a nozzle is put on,” the TASS news agency reported.
The children’s shot is expected to be ready for distribution by September 15, Gintsburg was quoted as saying during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin.
The research group tested the vaccine on children aged between 8 and 12 and found no side effects among the test group, including no increase in body temperature, Gintsburg said in comments reported by the TASS news agency.

The European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) safety committee in its evaluation said that capillary leak syndrome must be added as a new side effect to labeling on AstraZeneca’s vaccine.
It is a condition in which blood leaks from the smallest of vessels into muscles and body cavities and is characterized by swelling and a drop in blood pressure.
The regulator first began looking into these cases in April and the recommendation adds to AstraZeneca’s woes after its vaccine has been dogged with problems, including a possible link to rare blood clotting issues.
Last month, the EMA had advised against using the second AstraZeneca shot for people with the clotting conditions.

Malaysia and Taiwan this week became the latest in the region to warn they expected delays in deliveries of AstraZeneca vaccines manufactured in Thailand.
“Distribution to other Southeast Asian countries, including Malaysia, will commence in the coming weeks,” the company said in an e-mail to Reuters.
“We are working closely with each of the relevant governments to supply our COVID-19 vaccine as quickly as possible,” the AstraZeneca statement said.
It did not respond further to questions on the Thai plant’s current and anticipated future production levels.
AstraZeneca’s distribution plans in Southeast Asia depend on 200 million doses made by Siam Bioscience, a company owned by Thailand’s king that is making vaccines for the first time.
Questions about Siam Bioscience meeting production targets are sensitive because King Maha Vajiralongkorn is its sole owner. Insulting Thailand’s monarchy is a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
Siam Bioscience in January said it had an estimated production capacity of 200 million doses per year, an average of 15-20 million doses per month.
The Thai company and AstraZeneca have not revealed total production goals nor commented on whether the plant has missed its targets.
Malaysia had been due to receive 610,000 doses from Thailand in June and 1.6 million later this year, but its Science Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said on Wednesday, June 9, “we are expecting some delay.”
The first delivery to the Philippines, which was promised 17 million doses, was reduced and postponed by several weeks, a Philippine presidential adviser said last week.
Thailand, which expects to receive six million doses for June, last week received 1.8 million locally-produced doses and 200,000 imported from South Korea.
AstraZeneca has previously run into production and delivery problems in other parts of the world. A deal to set up production in Taiwan did not materialize and it is also facing a legal challenge by the European Union over a supply contract.",Reuters,"Jun 10, 2021 4:25 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/innovations/meet-grace-healthcare-robot-covid-19-created/,"Meet Grace, the healthcare robot COVID-19 created","The Hong Kong team behind celebrity humanoid robot Sophia is launching a new prototype, Grace, targeted at the healthcare market and designed to interact with the elderly and those isolated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Dressed in a blue nurse’s uniform, Grace has Asian features, collar-length brown hair and a thermal camera in her chest to take your temperature and measure your responsiveness. She uses artificial intelligence to diagnose a patient and can speak English, Mandarin and Cantonese.
“I can visit with people and brighten their day with social stimulation … but can also do talk therapy, take bio readings and help healthcare providers,” Grace told Reuters as she stood next to her “sister”, Sophia, in creator Hanson Robotics’ Hong Kong workshop.
Grace’s resemblance to a healthcare professional and capacity for social interaction is aimed at relieving the burden of front-line hospital staff overwhelmed during the pandemic, said founder David Hanson.
“A human-like appearance facilitates trust and natural engagement because we are wired for human face-to-face interactions,” Hanson said, explaining how Grace can simulate the action of more than 48 major facial muscles, and has a comforting demeanour designed to look a little like anime characters, often a fusion of Asian and Western styles.
Awakening Health intends to mass-produce a beta version of Grace by August, said David Lake, chief executive of the joint venture between Hanson Robotics and Singularity Studio, and there are plans to fully deploy her next year in locations including Hong Kong, mainland China, Japan and Korea.
The cost of making the robots, now akin to luxury car pricing, will decrease once the company is manufacturing tens or hundreds of thousands of units, Hanson added.
Grace’s launch comes as the global impact of the coronavirus has made the need for humanoid robots urgent, said Kim Min-Sun, a communicology professor at the University of Hawaii.
Stuck at home during COVID-19 lockdowns, many people have had their mental states affected with negative thoughts.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/us-fda-approves-biogen-alzheimers-drug/,"US FDA approves Biogen Alzheimer’s drug, hailed as ‘a big day’","US regulators on Monday, June 7, approved Biogen Inc’s aducanumab as the first treatment to address an underlying cause of Alzheimer’s disease despite controversy over mixed clinical trial results for the drug.
Aducanumab aims to remove sticky deposits of a protein called amyloid beta from the brains of patients in earlier stages of Alzheimer’s in order to stave off its ravages, which include memory loss and the ability to care for one’s self.
“This is good news for patients with Alzheimer’s disease. We’ve not had a disease modifying therapy approved ever,” said Dr. Ronald Petersen, an Alzheimer’s disease expert at the Mayo Clinic. However, he cautioned, “This is not a cure. It’s hoped that this will slow the progression of the disease.”
“It think this is a big day,” Dr. Peterson said. “But we can’t overpromise.”
The Food and Drug Administration said clinical trials for the treatment, to be sold under the brand name Aduhelm, showed a reduction in the plaques that is expected to lead to a reduction in the clinical decline of patients.
“Although the Aduhelm data are complicated with respect to its clinical benefits, FDA has determined that there is substantial evidence that Aduhelm reduces amyloid beta plaques in the brain and that the reduction in these plaques is reasonably likely to predict important benefits to patients,” the agency said in a statement.
The FDA said Biogen will need to conduct a post-approval trial to verify Aduhelm’s clinical benefit. “If the drug does not work as intended, we can take steps to remove it from the market,” it said.
Biogen’s drug had been hailed by patient advocates and some neurologists eager to have an effective option for patients with the lethal disease. Other doctors said clinical trial results were inconsistent and more proof was needed.
Aducanumab was studied in patients with early disease who test positive for a component of amyloid brain plaques. Some trial patients experienced potentially dangerous brain swelling.
Biogen has estimated that around 1.5 million Americans would be eligible for treatment with aducanumab, which is given by monthly infusion, raising concerns about costs to the healthcare system.
Biogen and partner Eisai Co had scrapped development of the drug in March 2019, then reversed course in October, saying a more detailed data analysis showed some patients with very early forms of the disease benefited from taking higher doses over an extended period of time.
Wall Street analysts had forecast that an FDA approval of Biogen’s drug could reinvigorate a field that has been abandoned by many large pharmaceutical companies.
“We think the drug has the potential to generate (at least)$10 billion in peak sales, and believe a successful launch of aducanumab has the potential to completely change the profile of the company,” said Guggenheim analyst Yatin Suneja.

But against popular belief, even if dementia is known to plague older people, it is not a sure thing that awaits you in old age.
The proof is that there are older people who do not have dementia. In fact, high income countries who have bigger aging populations have declining proportions of older people with dementia. Years of studies have now led to a scientific consensus that you can change the course of your journey to being older. These are like paths in a map that, if you take, will make you much less likely to end up on a shore where the waves start to erode your memories, and thus, your own sense of self.
The Lancet Commission updated the modifiable risk factors from 9 in 2017 to 12 last year. I call it the “Dementia dozen deal,” because as indicated, they are “modifiable,” i.e., to an extent, they are within your own “Houston control” to avoid or stop.
But they also come as a package. This means you cannot score by avoiding some and surrendering to others and calling it “quits.” So if you can make a map of your life of the things you can control, especially if you are still in early adulthood but also even later in life, put up your own “Do NOT Enter” signs at the start of these “Dementia Dozen Deal” roads that most likely will lead to your mind’s Neverland.
These dozen risks altogether, they have found, when avoided or managed can dramatically cut your dementia risk. How much would you kick yourself (or think of your loved ones) if you had the chance to cut your losses but still chose not to?
One of the things that adds to our anxieties is how much time has passed since the pandemic started. We are now more conscious of the things we would have wanted to do in those unrepeatable days and nights of our individual lifetimes. Now, we are inspired, more than ever, to be “present” in our lives for as long as we can. How will we do that if we lived lives where we led our brains to their own surrender?",Maria Isabel Garcia,"Jun 6, 2021 11:00 AM PHT"

Call it ‘Theta,’ says WHO","In a bid to simplify discussion and pronunciation while avoiding stigma, the  World Health Organization (WHO) gave new names for the COVID-19 variants, including the Philippine variant P3, which is now called Theta.
The WHO on Monday, May 31, revealed the new names of the variants, based on the letters of the Greek alphabet. The variants were grouped into two: variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI).
The Theta variant is considered a VOI. The Department of Health (DOH) earlier said that it was “not identified as a variant of concern, as current available data are insufficient to conclude whether the variant will have significant public health implications.”
The DOH has since discouraged the public to identify the variants according to where they were first detected to avoid stigma.
According to the WHO, a variant is considered VOC if it meets at least one of the following criteria:
Four VOCs have been detected to date: B117 (United Kingdom variant), B1351 (South Africa variant), P1 (Brazil variant), and B1617.2 (India variant). The Philippines has reported cases of these VOCs.
Here’s the list of the new names of the VOCs:

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/why-countries-best-placed-handle-pandemic-appear-fared-worst/,Why countries best placed to handle the pandemic appear to have fared the worst,"During the first year of the pandemic, it was wealthier countries, with their comparatively stronger health systems, civil services, legal systems, and other public services, that suffered the highest rates of COVID-19. Indeed, countries rated to be best prepared to respond to public health threats such as pandemics – those with the greatest “global health security” – had the most COVID-related fatalities.
On the face of it, this makes no sense. Poorer countries with weaker, less effective state institutions wouldn’t be expected to fare better in a pandemic. So in a recent working paper, we took a deep dive into the statistics to find out what might explain this unusual situation.
We looked at three core dimensions that tend to describe how effective states are at doing things. If states are effective, they usually have greater authority to provide order and security, greater capacity to provide public services, and greater legitimacy (which is a measure of how accepting citizens are of the state’s fundamental right to rule over them). So when preventing or dealing with COVID-19, we expected states with high authority (such as China), high capacity (Finland), and high legitimacy (Canada) to have an advantage over those with low authority (Honduras), low capacity (Liberia), and low legitimacy (Uzbekistan).
But this wasn’t the case. Simple correlations between these three core dimensions of the state and COVID-19 health outcomes are puzzling: countries with higher state effectiveness – no matter the dimension used to measure it – have had higher rates of COVID-19 infections and fatalities. And an initial look at national policies to contain the disease similarly reveals the unexpected: greater state effectiveness seems to be linked, weakly but still, to lighter restrictions.
Moreover, countries rated as having high authority and high capacity have also been slower than those with lower assessments to enact containment policies. Some “weaker” states – for instance, the Central African Republic, Somalia, and Yemen – closed and canceled public events more quickly than states considered to be more effective.
At a first look, then, the data seems to confirm that typically more effective states were generally less effective in their pandemic response. However, drawing such conclusions from simple correlations is misleading.
There are several factors that can explain differences in pandemic outcomes. For instance, countries bordering others with high infection rates are at a higher risk. This made southern Europe, made up of typically highly effective states, a high-risk area during the first wave of the pandemic, as it was an early place the virus took hold.
And because the elderly are more vulnerable to the virus, countries with older populations are also more susceptible to COVID-19. In some countries with highly effective state institutions, like Japan and Germany, over 20% of the population is 65 and above. In Uganda or Mali, for instance, it’s only around 2%.
We also know that with higher rates of COVID-19 testing, more infections and deaths are detected – and this detection typically happens more in countries with stronger health systems and public services. To get an accurate picture of the relationship between the state and COVID-19, such factors must be controlled for.
A completely different picture emerges once economic development, the age structure of the population, population density, testing rates, and proximity to badly affected countries are taken into account. When these relevant factors are analyzed, it appears more effective states have mounted more effective pandemic responses. There are, though, some differences in outcomes according to the three different dimensions of the state that we mentioned previously.
When controlling for the above factors, states with a greater capacity to provide public services have had fewer COVID-19 infections and deaths, as well as a lower ratio of infections leading to deaths (what’s known as the case-fatality rate). States with greater authority have also had lower case-fatality rates – consistent with our expectations – though not infections and deaths. On the other hand, there is no clear relationship between state legitimacy and pandemic outcomes.
Such findings should remind us that having strong state institutions does really matter – even if on the surface it looks like these institutions have failed.
This isn’t to say that many countries with “weaker” and less well-funded state institutions have not performed admirably in the pandemic. Prior experience with infectious diseases, public support for restrictions, and strong community action, among other factors, have all been important.
But admiring the resilience of communities and the skill and resourcefulness of (some) public officials should not distract us from the fact that those who live in weaker states remain, on average, more vulnerable to the pandemic in health and economic terms. As the COVID-19 crisis continues, we mustn’t let deceptive data hide the fact that those living in countries with less effective state institutions remain at a huge disadvantage, and that truly the pandemic has both reflected and exacerbated existing inequalities. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/what-we-know-so-far-h10n3-bird-flu/,"So far, low risk of human spread of H10N3 bird flu","A 41-year-old man in China’s eastern province of Jiangsu has been confirmed as the first human case of infection with a rare strain of bird flu known as H10N3, Beijing’s National Health Commission (NHC) has said.
The man, a resident of the city of Zhenjiang, was hospitalized on April 28 and diagnosed with H10N3 on May 28, the health commission said on Tuesday, June 1, adding that his condition is stable.
It did not give details on how the man was infected but said investigation of his close contacts found no other cases and the risk of spread was very low.
Little is known about the virus, which appears to be rare in birds, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and does not cause severe disease.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said while the source of the patient’s exposure to the H10N3 virus was not known and no other cases were found among the local population, there was no indication of human-to-human transmission yet.
Yet avian influenza viruses that have little impact on birds can be much more serious in people, such as the H7N9 strain that killed almost 300 people in China during the winter of 2016-2017. The WHO has said there had been only rare instances of person-to-person spread of the H7N9 virus.
The risk of further infection with H10N3 is currently believed to be very low, with experts describing the case as “sporadic.”
Such cases occur occasionally in China which has huge populations of both farmed and wild birds of many species.
And with growing surveillance of avian influenza in the human population, more infections with bird flu viruses are being picked up.
In February, Russia reported the first human infection with the H5N8 virus that caused huge damage on poultry farms across Europe, Russia and East Asia last winter.
Seven people infected with the virus were asymptomatic, authorities said.
Experts will be on alert for any clusters of H10N3 cases, but for now, a single case is not much of a concern.
“As long as avian influenza viruses circulate in poultry, sporadic infection of avian influenza in humans is not surprising, which is a vivid reminder that the threat of an influenza pandemic is persistent,” the WHO told Reuters in a statement.
The strain is “not a very common virus,” and only around 160 isolates of the virus were reported in the 40 years to 2018, according to Filip Claes, regional laboratory coordinator of the FAO’s Emergency Center for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the regional office for Asia and the Pacific.
Still, flu viruses can mutate rapidly and mix with other strains circulating on farms or among migratory birds, known as “reassortment,” meaning they could make genetic changes that pose a transmission threat to humans.
The genetic sequence of the virus that infected the patient has not yet been published, and will be needed to fully assess its risk.
Scientists will want to know how easily H10N3 can infect human cells to determine if it could become a greater risk.
For example, the H5N1 variant that first infected people in 1997 has been the most deadly, killing 455 people globally so far.
It would only take a few mutations before the H5N1 variant gains the ability to spread easily from person-to-person, said Ben Cowling, professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong, making it a high priority for surveillance.
Having the genetic information for the H10N3 variant would help assess if it was “close to being the type of virus we should be worried about”, he said.",Reuters,"Jun 2, 2021 6:19 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/middle-east/israel-sees-probable-link-between-pfizer-vaccine-myocarditis-cases/,Israel sees probable link between Pfizer vaccine and myocarditis cases,"Israel’s Health Ministry said on Tuesday, June 1, it had found the small number of heart inflammation cases observed mainly in young men who received Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine in Israel were likely linked to their vaccination.
Pfizer has said it has not observed a higher rate of the condition, known as myocarditis, than would normally be expected in the general population.
In Israel, 275 cases of myocarditis were reported between December 2020 and May 2021 among more than 5 million vaccinated people, the ministry said in disclosing the findings of a study it commissioned to examine the matter.
Most patients who experienced heart inflammation spent no more than four days in the hospital and 95% of the cases were classified as mild, according to the study, which the ministry said was conducted by three teams of experts.
The study found “there is a probable link between receiving the second dose (of Pfizer) vaccine and the appearance of myocarditis among men aged 16 to 30,” it said in a statement.
According to the findings, such a link was observed more among men aged 16 to 19 than in other age groups.
Pfizer said in a statement that it is aware of the Israeli observations of myocarditis, noting that no causal link to its vaccine has been established.
Adverse events are thoroughly reviewed and Pfizer meets regularly with the Vaccine Safety Department of the Israeli Ministry of Health to review data, it said.
Israel had held off making its 12- to 15-year-old population eligible for the vaccines, pending the Health Ministry report. In parallel to publishing those findings, a ministry committee approved vaccinating the adolescents, a senior official said.
“The committee gave the green light for vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds, and this will be possible as of next week,” Nachman Ash, Israel’s pandemic-response coordinator, told Radio 103 FM. “The efficacy of the vaccine outweighs the risk.”
A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory group last month recommended further study of the possibility of a link between myocarditis and mRNA vaccines, which include those from Pfizer and Moderna Inc.
CDC monitoring systems had not found more cases than would be expected in the population, but the advisory group said in a statement that members felt healthcare providers should be made aware of reports of a “potential adverse event.”
Israel has been a world leader in its vaccination rollout.
With COVID-19 infections down to just a handful a day and total active cases at just 340 across the country, the economy has fully opened, though restrictions remain on incoming tourism.
About 55% of Israel’s population has already been vaccinated. As of Tuesday, restrictions on social distancing and the need for special green vaccination passes to enter certain restaurants and venues were scrapped.",Reuters,"Jun 2, 2021 2:41 PM PHT"

A WHO emergency listing is a signal to national regulators on a product’s safety and efficacy. It will also allow the shot to be included in COVAX, the global program to provide vaccines mainly for poor countries, which faces major supply problems due to an Indian export suspension.
The independent panel of experts said in a statement it recommended Sinovac’s vaccine for adults over 18, with a second dose 2-4 weeks later. There was no upper age limit as data suggested it is likely to have a protective effect in older people.
The WHO’s technical advisory group, which began meeting on May 5, took the decision after reviewing the latest clinical data on the Sinovac vaccine’s safety and efficacy as well as the company’s manufacturing practices.
Branded CoronaVac in some regions, it is the second Chinese developed vaccine to win such WHO listing to combat COVID-19, after the May 7 approval of a shot developed by state-backed Sinopharm.
A third Chinese vaccine, produced by CanSino Biologics , has submitted clinical trial data, but no WHO review has been scheduled.
Sinovac said that it had supplied more than 600 million doses of its vaccine at home and abroad as of end-May and over 430 million doses have been administered.
Vaccine efficacy results showed that the vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 51% of those vaccinated and prevented severe COVID-19 and hospitalization in 100% of the studied population, the WHO said.
The WHO’s separate Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) had said previously in a review document that vaccine efficacy in multi-country Phase III clinical trials ranged from 51% to 84%.
Indonesia’s health ministry said on May 12 that its study of 120,000 healthcare workers who had received the vaccine found it was 94% effective at preventing symptomatic disease.
In a preliminary evaluation, the SAGE panel found that the shot was efficacious in preventing COVID-19 in adults under 60, but that some quality data on the risk of serious adverse effects was lacking.
It cited evidence gaps in safety in pregnancy, and on safety and clinical protection in older adults, those with underlying disease, and evaluation of rare adverse events detected through post-authorization safety monitoring.
The SAGE experts, who issue policy recommendations to states and dosage guidelines, reviewed Sinovac clinical data last month.

The man, a resident of the city of Zhenjiang, was hospitalised on April 28 after developing a fever and other symptoms, the NHC said in a statement.
He was diagnosed as having the H10N3 avian influenza virus on May 28, it said, but did not give details on how the man had been infected with the virus.
The man was stable and ready to be discharged from hospital. Medical observation of his close contacts had not found any other cases.
H10N3 is a low pathogenic, or relatively less severe, strain of the virus in poultry and the risk of it spreading on a large scale was very low, the NHC added.
The strain is “not a very common virus,” said Filip Claes, regional laboratory coordinator of the Food and Agriculture Organization’s Emergency Center for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific.
Only around 160 isolates of the virus were reported in the 40 years to 2018, mostly in wild birds or waterfowl in Asia and some limited parts of North America, and none had been detected in chickens so far, he added.
Analyzing the genetic data of the virus will be necessary to determine whether it resembles older viruses or if it is a novel mix of different viruses, Claes said.
Many different strains of avian influenza are present in China and some sporadically infect people, usually those working with poultry. There have been no significant numbers of human infections with bird flu since the H7N9 strain killed around 300 people during 2016-2017.

The World Health Organization revealed the new names on Monday, May 31, amid criticism that those given by scientists such as the so-called South African variant, which goes by multiple names including B.1.351, 501Y.V2 and 20H/501Y.V2, were too complicated.
As such, the four coronavirus variants considered of concern by the UN agency and known generally by the public as the UK, South Africa, Brazil, and India variants have now been given the letters Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta according to the order of their detection.
Other variants of interest continue down the alphabet.
“While they have their advantages, these scientific names can be difficult to say and recall, and are prone to misreporting,” said the WHO, explaining the decision.
The choice of the Greek Alphabet came after months of deliberations in which other possibilities such as Greek Gods and invented, pseudo-classical names were considered by experts, according to bacteriologist Mark Pallen who was involved in the talks.
But many were already brands, companies, or alien names.
Another idea to refer to variants of concern as VOC1, VOC2 etc. was scrapped after he pointed out it resembled an English swear word.
Historically, viruses have often been associated with the locations from which they are thought to have emerged such as Ebola which is named after the eponymous Congolese river.
But this can be damaging for the places and often inaccurate such as with the so-called “Spanish flu” pandemic of 1918 whose origins are unknown.
“No country should be stigmatized for detecting and reporting variants,” said WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove.
Before the new WHO scheme, some scientists had adopted their own simplified nomenclature for variants such as a February paper using bird names. However, it was criticized on the grounds that this could imperil birds and by the mother of a girl named “Robin.”

https://www.rappler.com/world/south-central-asia/india-accelerates-vaccine-supplies-fight-against-covid-19/,India accelerates vaccine supplies in fight against COVID-19,"India’s Serum Institute will increase production of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines by nearly 40% in June, officials said on Monday, May 31, in the first step towards alleviating a shortage that has worsened the country’s battle with coronavirus.
The world’s second most-populous nation has struggled with a catastrophic outbreak of COVID-19 since last month which is only now starting to abate after killing tens of thousands of people.
Government officials and experts say the only way India can avoid a third wave of infections is by having most of its 1.3 billion population inoculated.
The Serum Institute of India, the world’s biggest manufacturer of vaccines, will make 90 million doses of AstraZeneca in June from about 65 million a month now, a company spokesman told Reuters.
Most of the shots administered in India are AstraZeneca, but local firm Bharat Biotech also plans to ramp up production of its Covaxin vaccine to 23 million in June from about 10 million in April, a government official said.
“There will be a gradual buildup of vaccines,” said the official, who is involved in the approval of vaccines.
Only about 3% of India’s population is fully vaccinated and about 12% have got the first shot and are waiting for the second. State governments, including in the capital Delhi, have reported an acute shortage of vaccines and some are inoculating only the elderly and frontline workers.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has faced criticism for donating vaccines to neighboring countries and further afield early this year as part of a diplomatic initiative.
“The very possibility of a second wave was not considered serious enough, and all aspects of the pandemic response bore the brunt, including vaccination,” the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation said in a report on the vaccine rollout on Monday.
India reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections since April 11 on Monday at 152,734 cases over the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 3,128.
The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 28 million, while the death toll has reached 329,100, health ministry data showed.
Most experts believe the coronavirus infections and deaths are considerably undercounted. The New York Times said the most conservative estimate of deaths was 600,000 and the worst case scenario several times that number. The government has dismissed the assessments as absolutely false.
Dr Randeep Guleria, the head of the premier All India Institute of Medical Sciences based in New Delhi, said the pandemic was slowing in large parts of the country but it was not contained.
“We seem to be past the peak, but there is a certain level of concern about the south and north eastern states,” he said, stressing on the need for increased vaccinations.
Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine will also be launched in the Indian market next month, its local partner Dr Reddy’s Laboratories said.",Reuters,"May 31, 2021 8:51 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/society-culture/former-anti-vaxxers-covid-quit-coda-story/,The anti-vaxxers who came in from the cold,"The first vaccine is always the hardest.
Before she took her baby son to the clinic to get his routine two-month shots, Anita Emly, 34, cried through the night. For several years, she had immersed herself in pseudoscience and anti-vaccine propaganda, filled with horror stories of autism, paralysis and death. Terrified by what she had read, she began to refuse vaccinations for her children.
Emly gave birth to her son in February 2020, shortly before the coronavirus started to tear through her home city of New York. In response to the chaos around her, she did something remarkable: she changed her mind.
Growing up in Astoria, Queens, Emly’s family were sometimes distrustful of doctors. She described how her father, a first-generation Indian immigrant, preferred to save western medicine for emergencies. “He would kind of laugh, like, ‘Haha, Tylenol,’” she said, explaining that he preferred to use ginger, cloves and herbal teas for everyday complaints.
Emly is a carer for several older relatives and often saw them experience unforeseen side-effects after taking prescribed medication. She believed that doctors had not warned them that adverse reactions were possible. That left her feeling blindsided. “It was never communicated to us that these events could happen,” she said.
When she got pregnant with her eldest daughter in 2016, Emly began reading up on vaccines. She sought advice from family and friends, looked for alternative medical sources online and read a book by Dr Robert Sears.
Sears advises readers to follow an “alternative schedule” of only taking some shots and delaying others — an approach popular in certain pseudoscience circles. The controversial pediatrician has said that he is not anti-vaccine, but is simply setting out “both sides of the story.” In 2016, California’s medical board accused him of gross negligence for writing invalid vaccine exemptions and, in 2018, placed him on probation.
Emly’s doctor did not engage with her when he found out that she had refused the routine hepatitis B vaccine for her newborn daughter — he simply told her that she should take it. “He didn’t listen, he didn’t ask why,” she said. “He wasn’t wrong, but he just didn’t have the best bedside manner. And that matters.” That experience left Emly feeling even more resistant and laid the groundwork for her to reject vaccines altogether.
“I was just scared, so inaction became my choice,” she said.
For people like Emly, every decision to ignore the enormous body of evidence that vaccines are safe and effective makes it increasingly difficult to turn back towards accepted science.
According to the researcher and vaccine advocate David Robert Grimes, “It’s hard to leave these communities because they have a social aspect to them, a sense of belonging. When you have people who are very, very far down that rabbit hole, it’s very difficult to get out. They have to give up their entire worldview.”
But that is precisely what some of them do.
In early 2020, Emly’s family went through a terrible trauma. A close friend died of flu at just 28 years old. She had not been vaccinated. As the coronavirus hit New York, Emly saw more people in her community lose their lives. Neighborhood hospitals were full to bursting, trucks carrying corpses standing outside. Meanwhile, on Facebook, anti-vaxxers began to campaign against coronavirus restrictions.
“It really hit home,” she said. “It made me run from the anti-vax movement.”
In 2008, Facebook’s enormous anti-vaccine groups were not yet established. When Lydia Greene’s daughter began crying excessively after receiving her first routine shots, she turned to parenting message boards, including Mothering Forum and the Babycenter.
“She had a very… what I felt was a scary reaction,” said Greene, 39, whose last name has been changed. When she called the nurse, she was told that she was being a jumpy first-time mom. “I felt brushed off, kind of dumb, embarrassed and worried.”
Greene, who lives in Alberta, Canada, said that the forums “gave me an answer.” Users falsely informed her that her daughter may have contracted encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, and that the next shot could kill her. Though Greene wasn’t entirely convinced, she was sufficiently swayed to not vaccinate her again.
“That’s how I fell into it. And I stayed there for years,” she said. Over the next decade, Greene became more deeply involved in the online anti-vaccine community. Along with some 200,000 others, she joined conspiracy theorist Larry Cook’s Facebook group and followed the influential anti-vaccination activists Sherri Tenpenny and Del Bigtree.
“Nothing is more primal than the desire to protect your child,” she said. “It’s pretty easy for people to hack that and profit.”
Online anti-vaccine propaganda exposed Greene to cherry-picked segments of studies and false information. Though she had worked as a quality-control chemist in a pharmaceutical plant for several years, she began to subscribe to views that Big Pharma was “trying to cover up something” about vaccines.
However, it was a sprawling, global conspiracy theory that finally helped Greene renounce her views. As the QAnon movement spread across the world during the presidency of Donald Trump, she started to see increasingly extreme theories in her online groups. Some linked vaccines to Satanism, deep state plots and the idea that the earth is flat. Larry Cook recently began to proclaim that vaccines are part of a “global plan to enslave humanity” and “literally slaughter the population.” Rather than drawing her further in, this torrent of false information made her think again.
“It just seemed to get more ridiculous, and I had to either dig in further, and stay with them, or start questioning myself,” she said.
The most painful moment of reckoning came when Greene began to question the pervasive falsehood that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is linked to autism. Popularized by Andrew Wakefield, a disgraced former doctor from the U.K., it is one of the most deeply held beliefs among anti-vaxxers.
Greene described how Wakefield’s discredited theory blinded her to a reality that was right in front of her: that her own unvaccinated son was autistic. She was convinced that he couldn’t possibly have autism, because he had never received the MMR shot. His diagnosis helped to shatter the worldview that she had built for herself and her family.
“I was so wrapped up in this movement, I couldn’t see my own kid,” she said.
For 36-year-old Veronika Fitzgerald — a mother of two based in Perth, Western Australia — a New Age upbringing paved the way towards anti-vaccine ideology. During her childhood, her father collected books about UFOs, while her mother had a keen interest in mysticism. Fitzgerald was intrigued. As a teenager, she was seduced by the idea that 9/11 was an inside job and captivated by theories about the lost city of Atlantis.
When she had her first daughter, now seven, she decided on an alternative approach to parenting, choosing a home birth with a doula because she didn’t trust the hospital system, doing yoga and belly dance classes to prepare. She then met a friend who told her that she wasn’t going to vaccinate her baby. Fitzgerald started to research the subject and decided not to vaccinate either.
That decision pushed her away from her local mothers’ groups. ”I didn’t want to belong in the mainstream groups because I felt I couldn’t speak openly anymore. I was always the black sheep that didn’t vaccinate.”
As she slipped deeper into the anti-vaccine community, she became increasingly alienated from other parents, and medical professionals were visibly shocked by her beliefs. Then, one doctor, from India, described how children still died of polio in her country. That was when she began to rethink.
“I hadn’t considered that my decision to not do something might impact someone who’s actually quite vulnerable,” she said.
After losing two family members in Slovakia to Covid-19, Fitzgerald began to back away from the movement. “The number of times I heard that Covid was just the flu — it made me really sad,” she said. At the same time, doctors, friends, and family members made an effort to explain the importance of vaccines to her. She credits her brother with helping her to repair her relationship with accepted science and journalism.
“I had to relearn which sources and which media to read,” she explained.
Slowly, all three women began to inch away from their fears and towards getting their children fully vaccinated.
Emly and Greene have both had their coronavirus shots, while Fitzgerald plans to get hers as soon as she is eligible.
These are not easy decisions to make. “It’s almost like leaving a cult, and you’re about to do something that your religion frowned upon for the first time,” said Greene. “You’re still wondering secretly, is God watching? Is my soul going to hell? What If I’m wrong and I kill my kid?”
I know that the #antivaxxers tell me that a real antivaxxer will not change their mind, but our support group is growing a little bit everyday with people that were exactly like @HeatherBSimpson and I. People want out, and we will welcome them and give them a soft place to land.
“It’s a bit like deradicalization,” said Daniel Jolley, a social psychologist at the University of Northumbria. “People are drawn to conspiracy theories when they feel anxious and disempowered. Maybe when we communicate about these issues, we can try and include language that isn’t going to threaten or provoke people.”
For Emly, the hardest part is facing the fact that she had placed her own child at risk — “that I had actually endangered my daughter. I’m tearing up right now. That was painful,” she said.
Greene now runs a Facebook group titled “Back to the Vax”. At just 35 members, it is a fraction of the size of the anti-vax supergroups she used to be part of, but it provides a valuable community for people from all over the world, all at different stages of their recovery.
“A lot of them have lost their community,” said Greene. “It’s like a breath of fresh air to put it all out there and just say, ‘I made a mistake.’”",Isobel Cockerell,"May 31, 2021 6:56 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/dog-coronavirus-found-humans-why-you-should-not-worry/,Dog coronavirus found in humans: Why you shouldn’t worry,"Scientists have found a new canine coronavirus in a handful of people hospitalized with pneumonia. This may sound alarming, but once we unpack it, you will see that there’s no reason to lose any sleep.
The discovery of the canine coronavirus in eight people at a hospital in Sarawak, Malaysia, was reported in Clinical Infectious Diseases by a group of highly regarded international scientists. So does this mean dogs can spread coronaviruses to humans?
The first thing to clarify is what canine coronavirus is. Importantly, it is quite distinct from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The coronavirus family can be divided into four groups of viruses: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 falls within the betacoronaviruses group, whereas the canine coronaviruses are in the entirely separate alphacoronavirus group.
Scientists have known about canine coronaviruses for almost 50 years. These viruses have existed in relative obscurity over most of this period, being of interest only to veterinary virologists and occasional dog owners. There are no previous reports of these viruses infecting people. But the sudden international spotlight on all coronaviruses is finding coronaviruses in places we haven’t looked before.
The canine coronavirus infections recently identified in people were actually discovered serendipitously. Scientists were not specifically looking for canine coronavirus, and the patients involved had long since recovered. The researchers were trying to develop a new test that could detect all kinds of coronaviruses at the same time – a so-called pan-CoV test.
After confirming the test worked on samples of viruses grown in laboratories, they tested it on 192 human swabs from hospitalized pneumonia patients in Malaysia. Nine of these samples tested positive for coronaviruses.
Further analysis showed that five out of the nine samples were ordinary human coronaviruses that can cause colds. But, surprisingly, four of the samples were canine coronavirus. Further study of patients from the same hospital revealed four more positive patients.
The researchers studied nose and throat swabs from all eight Malaysian patients to try to learn more about the canine coronaviruses. Samples were put onto dog cells in the lab to see if any live virus was present. Virus from a single sample replicated well, and virus particles could be seen using electron microscopy. The scientists were also able to sequence the virus’s genome.
The analysis found that this canine coronavirus was closely related to a few different alphacoronaviruses – including those from pigs and cats – and showed it had not previously been identified anywhere else.
Was canine coronavirus responsible for the pneumonia in the patients? At the moment, we simply can’t tell. Seven out of eight patients were simultaneously infected with another virus, either adenovirus, influenza, or parainfluenza virus. We know that all of these viruses can cause pneumonia by themselves, so it is more likely that these were responsible for the disease. We can say there is an association between pneumonia and canine coronavirus in these patients, but we can’t say it is the cause.
There have been concerns that the canine coronavirus identified in these Malaysian patients could spread from person to person, resulting in a wider outbreak. What many headlines don’t clarify is that these human infections actually occurred in 2017 and 2018. This makes the likelihood of a canine coronavirus outbreak from this source even lower as there is no evidence of onward spread in the intervening three to four years.
As coronaviruses have become the center of attention and we search for related viruses, we are inevitably going to find more positive samples in unexpected places. The vast majority of these will be of academic interest only, and need not raise alarm. However, it is critical that surveillance for new coronaviruses continues and expands so that we have the best possible chance of identifying significant cross-species jumps in the future. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/sanofi-gsk-phase-3-trial-covid-19-vaccine/,"Sanofi, GSK kick off Phase 3 trial for COVID-19 shot","France’s Sanofi and Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline launched a late-stage human trial for a recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate on Thursday, May 27, which they hope to get approved by the end of 2021.
The study initiated by Sanofi and GSK is one of the first late stage trials that combines tests for boosters and variants, as drugmakers adapt their strategies to deal with an evolving coronavirus.
The two drugmakers, which earlier this month reported positive interim results, confirmed their double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study would include more than 35,000 adults in the United States, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
“In a two-stage approach, the study will initially investigate the efficacy of a vaccine formulation targeting the original virus, while a second stage will evaluate a second formulation targeting the B1351 virus,” Sanofi said.
The virus lineage known as B1351 was first detected in South Africa.
“Recent scientific evidence shows that antibodies created against the B1351 variant may provide broad cross-protection against other more transmissible variants,” Sanofi said.
“The design of the Phase 3, conducted across a broad diversity of geographies, also allows evaluation of the efficacy of the candidate against a variety of circulating variants,” the French drugmaker added in a statement.
Sanofi also confirmed it would begin clinical studies in the coming weeks to assess the efficacy of the vaccine as a booster, regardless of what vaccine a subject may have received first.
Pending a positive phase 3 outcome, the vaccine could be approved in the fourth quarter after it was initially targeted for the first half of the year before a setback.

The controversy has led to a raging debate online and in Congress to the point of dividing the medical community. Can an anti-parasitic drug really treat COVID-19? In a war against a rapidly mutating virus, some would rather take the risk on a potential treatment, even as clinical trials point to insufficient evidence on its effectivity. But clinical trial reviewers say “the evidence is evolving.”

US intelligence agencies are examining reports that researchers at a Chinese virology laboratory were seriously ill in 2019 a month before the first cases of COVID-19 were reported, according to US government sources who cautioned on Monday, May 24, that there is still no proof the disease originated at the lab.
“Phase 2 of the COVID origins study must be launched with terms of reference that are transparent, science-based, and give international experts the independence to fully assess the source of the virus and the early days of the outbreak,” US health secretary Xavier Becerra said in a video message to the annual ministerial meeting of the World Health Organization.
Becerra did not mention China directly, where the first known human cases of COVID-19 emerged in the central city of Wuhan in December 2019.
The origin of the virus is hotly contested. In a report  issued in March written jointly with Chinese scientists, a WHO-led team that spent four weeks in and around Wuhan in January and February said the virus had probably been transmitted from bats to humans through another animal, and that “introduction through a laboratory incident was considered to be an extremely unlikely pathway”.
A WHO spokesman, Tarik Jasarevic, asking about a follow-up mission, told Reuters on Monday that the agency was reviewing the recommendations from the report at the technical level.
“The technical teams will prepare a proposal for the next studies that will need to be carried out, and will present that to the Director-General for his consideration,” he said, referring to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
Jasarevic, noting Tedros’ remarks on March 30, said that further studies would be needed in a range of areas, including on the early detection of cases and clusters, the potential roles of animal markets, transmission via the food chain and the laboratory incident hypothesis.",Reuters,"May 25, 2021 7:33 PM PHT"

Breathonix, a spin-off company from the National University of Singapore (NUS), said it is now working with the health ministry to run a deployment trial of the technology at one of the city-state’s border points with Malaysia.
The breath analysis will be carried out alongside the current compulsory COVID-19 antigen rapid test.
The tests would be sold for between S$5-S$20 ($3.76-$15.03) each, depending on the number purchased, said a company representative.
The breath test achieved more than 90% accuracy in a Singapore-based pilot clinical trial, the company said last year.
The Health Sciences Authority’s website confirmed the approval, which the company said was the first such system to secure provisional authorization in Singapore.
The system uses disposable mouthpieces and is designed to ensure there is no cross-contamination. After blowing into the device, the technology assesses the chemical compounds of the breath to determine whether or not a person is infected.
Any individual screened as positive will need to undergo a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 swab test, the company said.
Breathonix said it is in discussion with several local and overseas organizations to use the system, citing strong commercial interest. Other countries, including Indonesia and the Netherlands, have rolled out similar breath tests.
After recording almost zero or single-digit daily coronavirus tallies locally for months, Singapore has seen the number of infections grow recently and include variants such as more contagious strains first detected in India.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/why-do-we-get-shots-arm-all-about-muscle/,Why do we get shots in the arm? It’s all about the muscle,"Millions have rolled up their sleeves for the COVID-19 vaccine, but why haven’t they rolled up their pants legs instead? Why do we get most shots in our arms?
As an associate professor of nursing with a background in public health, and as a mother of two curious kids, I field this question fairly often. So here’s the science behind why we get most vaccines in our arm.
It’s worth noting that most, but not all, vaccines are given in the muscle – this is known as an intramuscular injection. Some vaccines, like the rotavirus vaccine, are given orally. Others are given just beneath the skin, or subcutaneously – think of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. However, many others are given in the muscle.
But why is the muscle so important, and does location matter? And why the arm muscle – called the deltoid – in the top of the shoulder?
Muscles make an excellent vaccine administration site because muscle tissue contains important immune cells. These immune cells recognize the antigen, a tiny piece of a virus or bacteria introduced by the vaccine that stimulates an immune response. In the case of the COVID-19 vaccine, it is not introducing an antigen but rather administering the blueprint for producing antigens. The immune cells in the muscle tissue pick up these antigens and present them to the lymph nodes. Injecting the vaccine into muscle tissue keeps the vaccine localized, allowing immune cells to sound the alarm to other immune cells and get to work.
Once a vaccine is recognized by the immune cells in the muscle, these cells carry the antigen to lymph vessels, which transport the antigen-carrying immune cells into the lymph nodes. Lymph nodes, key components of our immune system, contain more immune cells that recognize the antigens in vaccines and start the immune process of creating antibodies.
Clusters of lymph nodes are located in areas close to vaccine administration sites. For instance, many vaccines are injected in the deltoid because it is close to lymph nodes located just under the armpit. When vaccines are given in the thigh, the lymph vessels don’t have far to travel to reach the cluster of lymph nodes in the groin.
Muscle tissue also tends to keep vaccine reactions localized. Injecting a vaccine into the deltoid muscle may result in local inflammation or soreness at the injection site. If certain vaccines are injected into fat tissue, the chance of irritation and inflammation reaction increases because fat tissue has poor blood supply, leading to poor absorption of some vaccine components.
Vaccines that include the use of adjuvants – or components that enhance the immune response to the antigen – must be given in a muscle to avoid widespread irritation and inflammation. Adjuvants act in a variety of ways to stimulate a stronger immune response.
Yet another deciding factor in vaccine administration location is the size of the muscle. Adults and children ages three and older tend to receive vaccines in their upper arm in the deltoid. Younger children receive their vaccines mid-thigh because their arm muscles are smaller and less developed.
Another consideration during vaccine administration is convenience and patient acceptability. Can you imagine taking down your pants at a mass vaccination clinic? Rolling up your sleeve is way easier and more preferred. Infectious disease outbreaks, as in flu season or amid epidemics like COVID-19, require our public health system to vaccinate as many people as possible in a short time. For these reasons, a shot in the arm is preferred simply because the upper arm is easily accessible.
All things considered, when it comes to the flu shot and the COVID-19 vaccine, for most adults and kids, the arm is the preferred vaccination route. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/happiness-equation-research/,Is there a happiness equation? Here’s how we’re trying to find out,"Most people would like to be happier. But it isn’t always easy to know how to achieve that goal. Is there an equation for happiness? Many formulas have been suggested. Get enough sleep. Exercise. Meditate. Help others. Spend time with friends and family. On average, all of these things are linked to happiness. But they don’t work for everyone.
Happiness is really complicated. It can change quickly and it’s different for everyone in ways that scientists don’t understand. In our ongoing research, we are trying to capture this subjectivity and get a more complete view of what happiness is.
Happiness surveys can only tell us so much, summarizing with a few questions how people feel in general. We also don’t know what they were doing a few minutes earlier, even though we know it might be important for understanding their responses.
So we turned to smartphones, which billions of people are using almost constantly. People often believe that smartphones are bad for happiness, but many of us enjoy popular games including Candy Crush Saga, Fortnite and Among Us on our devices. How we feel can change quickly while we play games, providing an opportunity to gather detailed information about the complexities of happiness.
We recently launched a smartphone app, The Happiness Project, which anyone can download for free. In less than five minutes, you can play one of four games to learn about and contribute to happiness research. So far, thousands of people have played, answering the question “How happy are you right now?” over one million times.
So far, we’ve managed to work out that expectations matter a lot. In 18,420 people playing a simple risky decision game on their phones, we showed that happiness depended not on how well they were doing, but whether they were doing better than expected.
Our research shows how high expectations can be a problem. Clearly, it’s not a good idea to tell a friend that they will love the gift you are about to give them. Lowering expectations at the last moment increases the probability of a positive surprise.
The problem with using this trick to hack your own happiness is that expectations about future events also influence happiness. If you make plans to catch up with a friend after work, you may be unhappy if they suddenly cancel. But expecting your friend to cancel won’t make you happy – you might be a little happier the whole day if you look forward to seeing them, even if there is some risk that things don’t work out.
Another reason that it’s hard to hack your happiness is that expectations are really important for decision making. If you always expect the worst, it’s difficult to make good choices. When things go better than expected, that’s information your brain can use to revise your expectations upward so you make even better choices in the future. Realistic expectations are generally best. In fact, we discovered that happiness is closely linked to learning about our environment.
There are times, such as on holiday, when lowering your expectations might not be a bad idea. After all, your expectations might be a bit unrealistic if you chose your holiday destination based on a friend’s rave review. You may enjoy yourself more if you don’t expect everything to go perfectly.
Another lesson from our smartphone games is that most events don’t affect happiness for long. This is referred to as the “hedonic treadmill.” You might think that there is something wrong with you if you don’t feel lasting happiness about a promotion, but time-limited joy is an adaptation that helps your brain adjust to your circumstances so you are ready to make your next move. In uncertain environments, including both games and real life, what happened minutes ago is often irrelevant to the task at hand.
The ephemeral nature of happiness means we might be better off thinking about happiness in a different way. Happiness is a tool, not a goal in itself. It can help us better understand what we care about, what we value. It can tell us whether things are going surprisingly well, which could motivate us to keep going at key moments. When our happiness drops, it may be a sign that we should try something new.
The pandemic has had a big impact on mental health. It’s never been more important to understand happiness and well-being. We don’t know why some people stay upset for longer than others. We don’t know why uncertainty is really stressful for some people but not others.
Our games aim to find out. Each of the four games focus on something that scientists know is important for happiness: uncertainty, thinking about the future, learning, and effort. In one game, you can use information about the future to make different decisions depending on whether things look good or bad. In another, you are a fisherman deciding how much effort to spend to increase your catch. By asking about happiness as you play these games, we can figure out the factors that matter for everyone.
The thousands of people playing the games in The Happiness Project will help scientists write the equations for happiness. There will never be one formula for happiness, but science can help explain the different factors that matter for happiness in each and every one of us. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/inside-race-find-covid-19-treatment-pill/,Inside the race to find a COVID-19 treatment pill,"In early 2020, as a new deadly coronavirus began spreading around the world, Pfizer Inc assembled what it called a “SWAT team” of scientists and chemists to identify a potential treatment to fight COVID-19.
The US pharmaceutical giant, which had begun exploring a vaccine, also wanted to produce a pill that could stop the infection from progressing, similar to how the widely-used Tamiflu drug fights influenza. The team scoured Pfizer’s library of molecules looking for unused compounds to help jumpstart the process, and quickly identified a promising candidate.
More than a year later, Pfizer has yet to embark on large-scale human trials of a COVID-19 oral treatment – something it says it hopes to start by July.
Pfizer and its rivals, including US-based Merck & Co Inc and Swiss pharmaceutical Roche Holding AG, are racing to produce the first antiviral pill that people could take at early signs of the illness. Their shared goal: filling a key treatment hole by helping people recently-infected with coronavirus to avoid becoming seriously ill and needing hospitalization.
But after almost 18 months of the pandemic, there is still no easy-to-administer treatment proven to be effective against COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. That is despite the development of a number of effective COVID-19 vaccines, including one from Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE, which in December became the first to gain authorization for use in the United States.
Pfizer’s experience underscores the challenges drugmakers face in developing an oral treatment for the virus. Unlike a vaccine, which needs only to trigger the body’s own immune system, an effective antiviral pill must block a virus from spreading throughout the body while also being selective enough to avoid interfering with healthy cells.
Testing antivirals is also difficult, drug company executives say. A drug needs to be given early in the course of an infection, which means finding trial participants who have recently contracted COVID-19. Many people infected with the virus develop only mild symptoms, but studies need to prove that a drug has a meaningful impact on patient health.
Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla has said the company could seek emergency authorization in the United States for a COVID-19 pill as soon as late this year.
“Right now we have very good reason to believe that we can be successful,” Bourla told an economic forum in Greece via video conference last week.
Pfizer and its rivals say the development process has been much faster than the several years it typically takes to produce a drug that can be taken as a pill.
Merck and Roche recently started late-stage human trials and have also said their drugs could be ready by later this year. Merck is developing its drug in partnership with biotech Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP and Roche is working with Atea Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Governments around the world have poured billions of dollars into vaccine development, but Pfizer, Merck, and Roche say they have not received government funding to develop oral antivirals for the disease.
While the rate of new COVID-19 infections is currently in retreat in some countries, others continue to struggle with a rapid spread of the virus. And with vaccines in short supply in many countries, much of the world will not be vaccinated for several years. Many people also remain reluctant to take vaccines.
Scientists forecast that COVID-19 – which has killed more than 3.5 million people globally – could become a seasonal disease similar to influenza.
“We need a pill that can keep people out of the hospital,” said Dr Rajesh Gandhi, a professor and infectious disease specialist at Harvard Medical School.
Doctors have tried a number of existing oral drugs in fighting COVID-19, but none of them have succeeded yet in rigorous clinical testing.
Currently, the only treatments shown to help COVID-19 patients avoid hospitalization are antibody drugs that require lengthy intravenous infusions and work less well against variants of the coronavirus.
Pfizer and its rivals say their oral antiviral candidates could be effective against a broad spectrum of coronavirus variants, but no relevant data has been made public.
For patients already hospitalized with COVID-19, treatment often involves steroids or anti-inflammatory drugs to manage symptoms of the infection, but these medications do not target the virus itself. The only antiviral drug approved in the United States to treat COVID-19 is Gilead Sciences Inc’s remdesivir, which is delivered intravenously and used only for hospitalized patients.
Gilead is currently testing an inhaled form of remdesivir and is exploring other compounds that may be effective oral agents.
“We are all on the hunt for the next Tamiflu,” said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey.
Tamiflu is recommended for people who have had flu for no more than two days and has been shown to shorten the duration of flu symptoms.
Pfizer’s scientists and chemists began hunting for an antiviral treatment in January last year. They quickly zeroed in on a compound from 2003, when the company had sought a treatment for the first global SARS pandemic, said Charlotte Allerton, Pfizer’s head of medicine design.
The compound belongs to a class known as protease inhibitors, designed to block a key enzyme, or protease, essential to the ability of the coronavirus to multiply. Similar drugs are used to treat other viral infections such as HIV and hepatitis C, both on their own and in combination with other antivirals.
Pfizer’s scientists hit an early stumbling block. Laboratory testing showed the drug candidate was active against the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, but concentrations were not strong enough to combat the virus in humans, Allerton said.
Pfizer continued working with the active component of that compound to formulate a drug that could be given intravenously. But antivirals are most useful if you catch a disease early, “and that isn’t easy with an IV drug,” said Allerton.
In March 2020, Pfizer scientists also started designing a new compound that could be absorbed through the stomach and taken as a pill, which they finalized in July, according to Allerton.
Discovering a protease inhibitor that could be delivered orally was “a bit of a chemistry masterpiece,” said Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten.
Antivirals are more complex to develop than vaccines because they have to target the virus after it is already replicating inside human cells, without damaging healthy cells. COVID-19 vaccines typically teach the human immune system to recognize and attack a portion of the “spike” protein that is specific to the coronavirus.
A COVID pill would likely be taken for only a few days, but drugmakers have had to move slowly to ensure safety.
The Merck and Roche drug candidates use different mechanisms to Pfizer’s, and to each other, to disrupt the replication machinery of the virus. But the companies share similar challenges in testing.
One is ensuring a patient receives the drug soon after infection with COVID-19. “It’s all about treating as early in the disease process as possible, when the virus is expanding,” Pfizer’s Dolsten said.
And with vaccination rates high in some regions, trials have to be located in countries where COVID-19 is still on the rise.
In March of this year, Pfizer began early-stage human trials in the United States of its experimental oral COVID-19 treatment, known as PF-07321332. It followed a separate trial by the company of the intravenous drug started last fall.
Dolsten declined to comment on how the pending late-stage trials of either drug will be structured.
Merck’s antiviral drug candidate, called molnupiravir, recently had a setback. The company said last month it would not pursue its use in hospitalized patients. But Merck said it was moving the drug into late-stage trials of a narrow group of non-hospitalized patients – specifically those who have had symptoms for no more than five days and with at least one risk factor for serious disease, such as advanced age, obesity or diabetes.
Merck said it could have definitive data by September or October.
Roche and its partner Atea are also limiting participation in their recently launched late-stage trial of their AT-527 drug to COVID-19 patients experiencing symptoms for less than five days. Atea said final trial results are expected before the end of this year.",Reuters,"May 21, 2021 8:48 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/study-new-type-coronavirus-originating-dogs-found/,New type of coronavirus originating in dogs found – study,"A new type of coronavirus believed to have originated in dogs was detected among patients hospitalized with pneumonia in 2017-2018, and may be the eighth unique coronavirus known to cause disease in humans if it is confirmed as a pathogen, a study said.
Researchers in the study, published in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal on Thursday, May 20, said their findings underscored the public health threat of animal coronaviruses.
The researchers said they had tested nasal swab samples taken from 301 pneumonia patients at a hospital in the east Malaysian state of Sarawak. Eight of the samples, mostly from children under 5 years old, came back positive for a canine coronavirus.
Further genomic sequencing found that the new strain, named CCoV-HuPn-2018, shared characteristics of other coronaviruses known to have infected cats and pigs but was mostly similar to one that is known to have infected dogs.
It also contained a genetic deletion, or mutation, that was not found in any known canine coronaviruses but was present in human strains such as SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic. The source of the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus itself, whether animal or other, remains unclear.
The paper’s authors said the findings indicated that the virus likely recently jumped from animals to humans, but stressed that more studies were needed to determine whether it can be transmitted between people.
They also said it was unclear whether the virus could make people sick, noting that it was possible it was merely “carried” in the patient’s airways without causing disease.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/astrazeneca-covid-19-shots-effective-united-kingdom-real-world-analysis/,2 AstraZeneca COVID-19 shots 85-90% effective – UK real-world analysis,"Two doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is around 85% to 90% effective against symptomatic disease, Public Health England (PHE) said on Thursday, May 20, citing an analysis of real-world data from the rollout of the shot.
Britain has suffered one of the worst death tolls globally from the pandemic, but has also had one of the fastest rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines, generating a lot of data about the use of the shots in real world settings.
In a weekly surveillance report, Public Health England said that the estimated effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine, invented at the University of Oxford, was 89% compared to unvaccinated people.
That compares to 90% estimated effectiveness against symptomatic disease for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.
“This new data highlights the incredible impact that both doses of the vaccine can have, with a second dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine providing up to 90% protection,” vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said.
PHE said there was a “small reduction in vaccine effectiveness” from 10 weeks after the first dose. Britain extended the gap between doses to 12 weeks, though Pfizer warned there was a lack of evidence of its efficacy outside the three-week gap used in trials.
Last week, Britain cut the gap between doses down to 8 weeks for the over 50s, aiming to give maximum protection to more vulnerable people in light of concern about the B.1.617.2 variant first found in India.
Britain has been rolling out the shots manufactured by Pfizer and AstraZeneca since December and January respectively, and in April also started rolling out Moderna’s vaccine.
PHE also estimated that the COVID-19 vaccine program overall had prevented the deaths of 13,000 over-60s up to May 9, and stopped 39,100 of those over 65 from needing hospital treatment from COVID-19.",Reuters,"May 20, 2021 11:07 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/paying-people-get-vaccinated-might-work-but-ethical/,Paying people to get vaccinated might work – but is it ethical?,"A financial shot in the arm could be just what is needed for Americans unsure about vaccination.
On May 12, the Republican governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced five $1 million lottery prizes for those who are vaccinated. Meanwhile, in West Virginia, younger citizens are being enticed to get the shot with $100 savings bonds, and a state university in North Carolina is offering students who get vaccinated a chance to win the cost of housing. Many companies are paying vaccinated employees more money through bonuses or extra paid time off.
The push to get as many people vaccinated as possible is laudable and may well work. But leading behavioral scientists are worried that paying people to vaccinate could backfire if it makes people more skeptical of the shots. And ethicists have argued that it would be wrong, citing concerns over fairness and equity.
As a behavioral scientist and ethicist, I draw on an extensive body of research to help answer these questions. It suggests that incentives might work to save lives and, if properly structured, need not trample individual rights or be a huge expense for the government.
In the United States, incentives and disincentives are already used in health care. The US system of privatized health insurance exposes patients to substantial deductibles and copays, not only to cover costs but to cut down on what could be deemed as wasteful health care – the thinking being that putting a cost to an emergency room visit, for example, might deter those who aren’t really in need of that level of care.
In practice, this means patients are encouraged to decline both emergency and more routine care, since both are exposed to costs.
In the case of COVID-19, the vaccines are already free to consumers, which has undoubtedly encouraged people to be immunized. Studies have shown that reducing out-of-pocket costs can improve adherence to life-sustaining drugs, whether to prevent heart attacks or to manage diabetes.
A payment to take a drug goes one step further than simply reducing costs. And if properly designed, such incentives can change health behaviors.
Payments and cash prizes have been shown effective in encouraging blood donations, adherence to blood thinner drugs, blood glucose monitoring, physical activity, and smoking cessation.
And for vaccination in particular, payments have been succesful for human papillomavirus (HPV) in England; hepatitis B in the United States and the United Kingdom; and tetanus toxoid in Nigeria. The effects can be substantial: for example, for one group in the HPV study, the vaccination rate more than doubled with an incentive.
For COVID-19, there are no field studies to date, but several survey experiments, including one my group conducted with 1,000 Americans, find that incentives are likely to work. In our case, the incentive of a tax break was enough to encourage those hesitant about vaccinations to say they would take the shot.
Even if incentives will save lives by increasing vaccinations, there are still other ethical considerations. A key concern is protecting the autonomous choices of people to decide what they put into their own bodies. This may be especially important for the COVID-19 vaccines, which – although authorized as likely safe and effective – are not yet fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
But already people are often paid to participate in clinical trials for drugs that have not yet been approved by the FDA. Ethicists have worried that such payments may be “coercive” if the money is so attractive as to override a person’s free choices or make them worse off overall.
One can quibble about whether the term “coercion” applies to offers of payment. But even if offers were coercive, payments may still be reasonable to save lives in a pandemic if they succeed in greater levels of immunization.
During the smallpox epidemic nearly 100 years ago, the US Supreme Court upheld the power of states to mandate vaccines. Compared with mandating vaccination, the incentives to encourage vaccines seem innocuous.
Yet some still worry. Bioethicists Emily Largent and Franklin Miller wrote in a recent paper that a payment might “unfairly” exploit “those US residents who have lost jobs…or slipped into poverty during the pandemic,” which could leave them feeling as if they have “no choice but to be vaccinated for cash.” Others have noted that vaccine hesitancy is higher in non-white communities, where incomes tend to be lower, as is trust in the medical establishment.
Ethicists and policymakers should indeed focus on the poorest members of our community and seek to minimize racial disparities in both health outcomes and wealth. But there is no evidence that offering money is actually detrimental to such populations. Receiving money is a good thing. To suggest that we have to protect adults by denying them offers of money may come across as paternalism.
Some ethicists also argue that the money is better spent elsewhere to increase participation. States could spend the money making sure vaccines are convenient to everyone, for example, by bringing them to community events and churches. Money could also support various efforts to fight misinformation and communicate the importance of getting the shot.
Financial incentives could be expensive as a policy solution. As in Ohio, lottery drawings are one way to cap the overall cost of incentives while giving millions of people an additional reason to get their shot.
The tax code could also allow for a no-cost incentive for vaccination. Tax deductions and credits are often designed to encourage behaviors, such as savings or home ownership. Some states now have big budget surpluses and are considering tax relief measures. If a state announced now that such payments would be conditional on being vaccinated, then each person declining the shot would save the government money.
Ultimately, a well-designed vaccination incentive can help save lives and need not keep the ethicists up at night. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/colon-cancer-screening-should-start-age-45-united-states/,"Colon cancer screening should start at age 45, says US task force","Routine screening for colorectal cancer in people deemed at average risk should begin at age 45 – earlier than previous guidelines to start screening at 50 – due to rising incidence of the disease in younger adults, according to new recommendations from a US task force.
The new US guidance is now aligned with that of the American Cancer Society, which in 2018 lowered its recommended age for routine colorectal cancer screening to 45 from 50.
Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, with nearly 53,000 people in the United States projected to die of the disease this year, according to the US Preventive Task Force, whose guidelines are followed by doctors, insurance companies and policymakers.
Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed in people between the ages of 65 and 74, but nearly 11% of new  cases occur in people younger than 50, according to the task force.
The incidence of colorectal cancer in adults aged 40 to 49 has increased by almost 15% over the past 15 years, the task force – a group of independent experts appointed by the Department of Health and Human Services – said in a statement published on Tuesday in the JAMA medical journal.
It said rates of colorectal cancer are higher in Black adults, Native Americans and indigenous Alaskans. They are also higher for people with a family history of colorectal cancer, men, and those with other risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, history of smoking or unhealthy alcohol use.
“The updated guidelines will make lifesaving colorectal cancer screening available to millions more people in the US and offer the potential for averting colorectal cancer diagnoses and deaths,” Dr. Kimmie Ng, director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at the Dana-Farber Institute in Boston, said in a JAMA editorial.
She said about a third of the population over the age of 50 who should already be undergoing routine screening are not being screened for colorectal cancer.
To address that, Dr. Ng suggested employers could offer a paid “wellness day” for employees, weekend and after-hours appointments be made available, and that ride services be offered to individuals who do not have the caregiver support needed after a colonoscopy, which typically requires anesthesia.
In the United States, colonoscopy is the most common method used to screen for colorectal cancer. Other methods include fecal occult blood tests and flexible sigmoidoscopy followed by colonoscopy if precancerous polyps are detected so they can be removed.
In deciding on a screening method, the guidelines say clinicians and patients can consider a variety of factors, such as how often various tests need to be done. Stool-based tests, for instance, may need to be done annually, while colonoscopies for people at average risk are suggested every 10 years.
The task force still recommends that screening of adults aged 76 to 85 should be based on individual considerations and that routine screening be discontinued after the age of 85.",Reuters,"May 18, 2021 11:54 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/spanish-study-finds-astrazeneca-vaccine-followed-by-pfizer-dose-is-safe-and-effective/,Spanish study finds AstraZeneca vaccine followed by Pfizer dose is safe and effective,"A Spanish study on mixing COVID-19 vaccines has found that giving a dose of Pfizer’s drug to people who already received a first shot of AstraZeneca vaccine is highly safe and effective, preliminary results showed on Tuesday, May 18.
The Combivacs study, run by Spain’s state-backed Carlos III Health Institute, found the presence of IgG antibodies in the bloodstream was between 30 and 40 times higher in people who got the follow-up Pfizer shot than in a control group who only received one AstraZeneca dose.
Meanwhile, the presence of neutralising antibodies rose sevenfold after a Pfizer dose, significantly more than the doubling effect observed after a second AstraZeneca shot.
Around 670 volunteers between the ages of 18-59 who had already received a first dose of AstraZeneca’s vaccine participated in the study, with some 450 given a Pfizer dose.
Just 1.7% of the participants reported severe side effects, which were limited to headaches, muscle pain and general malaise, said Dr Magdalena Campins, one of the study’s leaders.
“These are not symptoms that can be considered serious,” she said.
In a UK “mix-and-match” study, first findings recently showed that people vaccinated with a shot of Pfizer’s vaccine followed by a dose of AstraZeneca’s, or vice versa, were more likely to report mild or moderate symptoms such as headaches or chills than if they received two of the same type. Data on immune responses are expected in the coming months.
Spain embarked on the study to determine how best to proceed after limiting AstraZeneca’s shot to people aged over 60 due to concerns about blood clotting in younger people.
That restriction caused widespread uncertainty and meant some younger people who had already received a first dose have been excluded from getting a second.
“Today’s results support the possibility of vaccinating patients who have received the first dose from AstraZeneca, but the decision is not up to the investigators of this study,” said Jesus Antonio Frias, clinical director at Carlos III.",Reuters,"May 18, 2021 9:29 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/why-no-hiv-vaccine-after-37-years/,Why don’t we have an HIV vaccine after 37 years? COVID-19 vaccines took months.,"Smallpox has been eradicated from the face of the Earth following a highly effective, worldwide vaccination campaign. Paralytic poliomyelitis is no longer a problem in the US because of development and use of effective vaccines against the poliovirus. In current times, millions of lives have been saved because of rapid deployment of effective vaccines against COVID-19. And yet, it has been 37 years since HIV was discovered as the cause of AIDS, and there is no vaccine. Here I will describe the difficulties facing development of an effective vaccine against HIV/AIDS.
I am a professor of pathology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. My laboratory is credited with the discovery of the monkey virus called SIV, or simian immunodeficiency virus. SIV is the close monkey relative of the virus that causes AIDS in humans – HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus. My research has contributed importantly to the understanding of the mechanisms by which HIV causes disease and to vaccine development efforts.
Vaccines have unquestionably been society’s most potent weapon against viral diseases of medical importance. When the new disease AIDS burst onto the scene in the early 1980s and the virus that caused it was discovered in 1983-84, it was only natural to think that the research community would be able to develop a vaccine for it.
At a now famous press conference in 1984 announcing HIV as the cause of AIDS, then US Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler predicted that a vaccine would be available in two years. Well, it is now 37 years later and there is no vaccine. The rapidity of COVID-19 vaccine development and distribution puts the lack of an HIV vaccine in stark contrast. The problem is not failure of government. The problem is not lack of spending. The difficulty lies in the HIV virus itself. In particular, this includes the remarkable HIV strain diversity and the immune evasion strategies of the virus.
So far there have been five large-scale Phase 3 vaccine efficacy trials against HIV, each at a cost of over US$100 million. The first three of these failed quite convincingly; no protection against acquisition of HIV infection, no lowering of viral loads in those who did become infected. In fact, in the third of these trials, the STEP trial, there was a statistically significant higher frequency of infection in individuals who had been vaccinated.
The fourth trial, the controversial Thai RV144 trial, initially reported a marginal degree of successful protection against the acquisition of HIV infection among vaccinated individuals. However, a subsequent statistical analysis reported that there was less than a 78% chance that the protection against acquisition was real.
A fifth vaccine trial, the HVTN 702 trial, was ordered to confirm and extend the results of the RV144 trial. The HVTN702 trial was halted early because of futility. No protection against acquisition. No lowering of viral load. Ouch.
What is the problem? The biological properties that HIV has evolved make development of a successful vaccine very, very difficult. What are those properties?
First and foremost is the continuous unrelenting virus replication. Once HIV gets its foot in the door, it’s “gotcha.” Many vaccines do not protect absolutely against the acquisition of an infection, but they are able to severely limit the replication of the virus and any illness that might result. For a vaccine to be effective against HIV, it will likely need to provide an absolute sterilizing barrier and not just limit viral replication.
HIV has evolved an ability to generate and to tolerate many mutations in its genetic information. The consequence of this is an enormous amount of variation among strains of the virus not only from one individual to another but even within a single individual. Let’s use influenza for a comparison. Everyone knows that people need to get revaccinated against influenza virus each season because of season-to-season variability in the influenza strain that is circulating. Well, the variability of HIV within a single infected individual exceeds the entire worldwide sequence variability in the influenza virus during an entire season.
What are we going to put into a vaccine to cover this extent of strain variability?
HIV has also evolved an incredible ability to shield itself from recognition by antibodies. Enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses and herpes viruses encode a structure on their surface that each virus uses to gain entry into a cell. This structure is called a “glycoprotein,” meaning that it is composed of both sugars and protein. But the HIV envelope glycoprotein is extreme. It is the most heavily sugared protein of all viruses in all 22 families. More than half the weight is sugar. And the virus has figured out a way, meaning the virus has evolved by natural selection, to use these sugars as shields to protect itself from recognition by antibodies that the infected host is trying to make. The host cell adds these sugars and then views them as self.
These properties have important consequences relevant for vaccine development efforts. The antibodies that an HIV-infected person makes typically have only very weak neutralizing activity against the virus. Furthermore, these antibodies are very strain-specific; they will neutralize the strain with which the individual is infected but not the thousands and thousands of other strains circulating in the population. Researchers know how to elicit antibodies that will neutralize one strain, but not antibodies with an ability to protect against the thousands and thousands of strains circulating in the population. That’s a major problem for vaccine development efforts.
HIV is continually evolving within a single infected individual to stay one step ahead of the immune responses. The host elicits a particular immune response that attacks the virus. This puts selective pressure on the virus, and through natural selection a mutated virus variant appears that is no longer recognized by the individual’s immune system. The result is continuous unrelenting viral replication.
So, should we researchers give up? No, we shouldn’t. One approach researchers are trying in animal models in a couple of laboratories is to use herpes viruses as vectors to deliver the AIDS virus proteins. The herpes virus family is of the “persistent” category. Once infected with a herpes virus, you are infected for life. And immune responses persist not just as memory but in a continually active fashion. Success of this approach, however, will still depend on figuring out how to elicit the breadth of immune responses that will allow coverage against the vast complexity of HIV sequences circulating in the population.
Another approach is to go after protective immunity from a different angle. Although the vast majority of HIV-infected individuals make antibodies with weak, strain-specific neutralizing activity, some rare individuals do make antibodies with potent neutralizing activity against a broad range of HIV isolates. These antibodies are rare and highly unusual, but we scientists do have them in our possession.
Also, scientists have recently figured out a way to achieve protective levels of these antibodies for life from a single administration. For life! This delivery depends on a viral vector, a vector called adeno-associated virus. When the vector is administered to muscle, muscle cells become factories that continuously produce the potent broadly neutralizing antibodies. Researchers have recently documented continuous production for six and a half years in a monkey.
We are making progress. We must not give up. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/sanofi-gsk-report-positive-interim-results-their-covid-19-shot/,Sanofi-GSK report positive interim results for their COVID-19 shot,"An experimental COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline showed a robust immune response in early-stage clinical trial results, enabling them to move to a late-stage study, the French drugmaker said on Monday, May 17.
Sanofi and Britain’s GSK said a global Phase III trial would start in the coming weeks and involve more than 35,000 adults, with the hope of seeing the vaccine approved by the fourth quarter after having initially targeted the first half of this year before a setback.
Sanofi and GSK last December were forced to restart their trial when the vaccine showed a low immune response in older adults as a result of a weak antigen formulation.
Sanofi and GSK shares were little changed in early trading.
“The Phase II interim results showed 95% to 100% seroconversion following a second injection in all age groups and across all doses, with acceptable tolerability and no safety concerns,” Sanofi said.
Seroconversion refers to the vaccine’s ability to prompt the body to produce antibodies against the coronavirus, as measured by blood readings. Later mass trials will be based on real infections.
“Interestingly, we also observed that our vaccine generated a higher antibody response in those with previous COVID-19 infection, we are analysing this further as it may suggest our vaccine could serve as a potential booster, regardless of what vaccine someone may have received (beforehand),” Su-Peing Ng, Sanofi’s global head of medical for vaccines, told reporters.
Ng said the vaccine had not been tested against so-called variants in the Phase II trial but that the Phase III study would be assessing it against various strains including a virus lineage known as B.1.351 first detected in South Africa.
But Sanofi, Ng said, has conducted parallel studies evaluating its vaccines against variants, with results expected to be published soon.
GSK and Sanofi’s vaccine candidate uses the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines. It will be coupled with an adjuvant, a substance that acts as a booster to the shot, made by GSK.
Some 162.75 million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019, while economies have taken a hit and restrictions have turned daily life upside down.
The United States and Europe have embarked on mass vaccinations programs in the past months, raising hopes of a gradual reopening, although the virus is still in circulation in many regions, with variants causing concern.
Last month, the European Union executive’s President Ursula von der Leyen said protein-based COVID-19 vaccines such as the one developed by Sanofi and GSK offered “quite a potential”, a positive signal as the bloc develops its purchasing strategy for the next two years.
Sanofi’s shot, however, even if approved, will come long after ones from Pfizer/BioNTech  and Moderna , which have produced efficacy results of more than 90%.
So far, Sanofi has purchasing agreements with the United States, the EU, Britain and Canada, as well as with the World Health Organization-backed COVAX facility.
The company has pledged to help other drugmakers this year, striking “fill and finish” deals for vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.
In addition to its vaccine project in collaboration with GSK, Sanofi is working on a mRNA candidate with US company Translate Bio for which it has started clinical trials.",Reuters,"May 17, 2021 6:03 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/long-working-hours-killer-who/,Long working hours are a killer – WHO,"Working long hours is killing hundreds of thousands of people a year in a worsening trend that may accelerate further due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization said on Monday, May 17.
In the first global study of the loss of life associated with longer working hours, the paper in the journal Environment International showed that 745,000 people died from stroke and heart disease associated with long working hours in 2016.
That was an increase of nearly 30% from 2000.
“Working 55 hours or more per week is a serious health hazard,” said Maria Neira, director of the WHO’s Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health.
“What we want to do with this information is promote more action, more protection of workers,” she said.
The joint study, produced by the WHO and the International Labor Organization, showed that most victims (72%) were men and were middle-aged or older. Often, the deaths occurred much later in life, sometimes decades later, than the shifts worked.
It also showed that people living in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region – a WHO-defined region which includes China, Japan, and Australia – were the most affected.
Overall, the study – drawing on data from 194 countries – said that working 55 hours or more a week is associated with a 35% higher risk of stroke and a 17% higher risk of dying from ischemic heart disease compared with a 35-40 hour working week.
The study covered the period 2000-2016, and so did not include the COVID-19 pandemic, but WHO officials said the surge in remote working and the global economic slowdown resulting from the coronavirus emergency may have increased the risks.
“The pandemic is accelerating developments that could feed the trend towards increased working time,” the WHO said, estimating that at least 9% of people work long hours.
WHO staff, including its chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, say they have been working long hours during the pandemic and Neira said the UN agency would seek to improve its policy in light of the study.
Capping hours would be beneficial for employers since that has been shown to increase worker productivity, WHO technical officer Frank Pega said.

The novel coronavirus, which emerged in China in late 2019, has killed 3.34 million people, cost the world trillions of dollars in lost income and upended daily life for billions of people.
“More investigation is still needed to determine the origin of the pandemic,” said the 18 scientists, including Ravindra Gupta, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Cambridge and Jesse Bloom, who studies the evolution of viruses at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
“Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,” the scientists including David Relman, professor of microbiology at Stanford, said in a letter to the journal Science.
The authors of the letter said the World Health Organization’s initial investigation into the origins of the virus had not made a “balanced consideration” of the theory that it may have come from a laboratory incident.
“We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,” the scientists said, adding that an intellectually rigorous and dispassionate investigation needed to take place.
“In this time of unfortunate anti-Asian sentiment in some countries, we note that at the beginning of the pandemic, it was Chinese doctors, scientists, journalists, and citizens who shared with the world crucial information about the spread of the virus – often at great personal cost.”",Reuters,"May 14, 2021 2:32 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/indian-states-turn-ivermectin-fight-covid19-against-who-advice/,Indian states turn to ivermectin in fight vs COVID-19 against WHO advice,"At least two Indian states have said they plan to dose their populations with the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin to protect against severe COVID-19 infections as their hospitals are overrun with patients in critical condition.
The move by the coastal state of Goa and northern state of Uttarakhand, come despite the World Health Organization and others warning against such measures.
“The current evidence on the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 patients is inconclusive,” WHO said in a statement in late March. “Until more data is available, WHO recommends that the drug only be used within clinical trials.”
Merck, a manufacturer of the drug, has also said available data does not support using the drug as a COVID-19 treatment.
“We do not have enough data to support its use,” said Anita Mathew, an infectious diseases expert in Mumbai.
The state of Goa, a major tourist haven, said earlier this week it plans to give ivermectin to all those older than 18, while the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand announced plans on Wednesday, May 12, to distribute the tablets to any person over the age of two, except for pregnant and lactating women.
“An expert medical panel has recommended this” Uttarakhand’s Chief Secretary Om Prakash told Reuters. “We are waiting for supplies to come in. Once they do we will distribute this drug.”
Uttarakhand state in March and April played host to the Kumbh Mela, a weeks-long Hindu gathering that attracted millions of devotees from across the country. Images of the gathering showed scant evidence of any mask wearing or social distancing as throngs of people congregated for a holy dip in the river Ganges.
The state, ruled by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, has since early April seen its COVID-19 cases surge from under 300 a day to above 7,000 a day and the death toll has also risen sharply.
Modi and other political leaders in India have faced sharp criticism for failing to stop big religious and political gatherings in many states, despite evidence from mid-February onward that India’s case count was rising.
Despite India’s overwhelming surge in cases, Modi has shied away from imposing a nationwide lockdown fearing the economic fallout and has left it to state governments, which experts say have acted too late.
Uttarakhand state currently has coronavirus-related social restrictions, including curbs on interstate travel.
Goa, which is also ruled by Modi’s BJP, remains open to tourists and only imposed an extended 15-day lockdown this week, despite data showing more than one in three patients were testing positive for COVID-19 since mid-April. The state is reporting the highest positivity rates in the country.
Goa Health Minister Vishwajit Rane said an expert panel based in Europe had found the drug ivermectin reduced the time to recovery and risk of death, but regulators such as WHO and the US Food and Drug Administration say there is little evidence of this.
The state-run Indian Council of Medical Research recommends doctors could use the drug for mild COVID-19 patients, but warns this is based on “low certainty of evidence”.

https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/pfizer-seeks-uk-approval-covid-19-vaccine-teenagers/,Pfizer seeks UK approval for use of COVID-19 vaccine in teenagers,"Pfizer is seeking British approval for the use of its COVID-19 vaccine among 12- to 15-year olds and has submitted data to the health regulator, a company representative said on Tuesday, May 11, paving the way for inoculation of adolescents in the country.
The vaccine, developed along with Germany’s BioNTech, has already been approved in the United States and Canada for use against COVID-19 infections in children and young adults.
“I can confirm we’ve submitted data on the efficacy of the vaccine in 12 to 15 year olds for review by UK MHRA,” an official for the USdrugmaker told Reuters, referring to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.
Health officials are banking on vaccines to end the pandemic, but are worried that some parents will be hesitant in vaccinating their children due to fears of potential side effects and long-term risks. Kids under 12 have so far been less susceptible to COVID-19.
The drug makers have said their shot is safe, effective and produced robust antibody responses in children as young as 12 years of age.
The vaccine, which uses mRNA technology to deliver instructions to the human body to build immunity against the illness, is also being tested in children aged two to 11, with safety and efficacy data expected in September, Pfizer has said.
Although other drug makers, including AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, are working on vaccines for children, Pfizer and BioNTech have managed to steal a march.
Pfizer’s vaccine, branded Comirnaty, is also under an EU review for use in children aged 12 to 15 years, with the head of the region’s medicines regulator saying an approval could come as early as end-May.
The Telegraph earlier reported on the British review, saying the vaccine was likely to be approved before the end of July.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-classifies-india-variant-of-global-concern/,WHO classifies India variant as being of global concern,"The World Health Organziation said on Monday, May 10, that the coronavirus variant first identified in India last year was being classified as a variant of global concern, with some preliminary studies showing that it spreads more easily.
The B1617 variant is the fourth variant to be designated as being of global concern and requiring heightened tracking and analysis. The others are those first detected in Britain, South Africa, and Brazil.
“We are classifying this as a variant of concern at a global level,” Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO technical lead on COVID-19, told a briefing. “There is some available information to suggest increased transmissibility.”
Indian coronavirus infections and deaths held close to record daily highs on Monday, increasing calls for the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lock down the world’s second-most populous country.
The WHO has said the predominant lineage of B1617 was first identified in India in December, although an earlier version was spotted in October 2020.
The variant has already spread to other countries, and many nations have moved to cut or restrict movements from India.
Van Kerkhove said more information about the variant and its three sub-lineages would be made available on Tuesday.
“Even though there is increased transmissibility demonstrated by some preliminary studies, we need much more information about this virus variant and this lineage and all of the sub-lineages,” she said.
Soumya Swaminathan, WHO chief scientist, said studies were under way in India to examine the variant’s transmissibility, the severity of disease it causes, and the response of antibodies in people who have been vaccinated.
“What we know now is that the vaccines work, the diagnostics work, the same treatments that are used for the regular virus works, so there is really no need to change any of those,” Swaminathan said.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/biontech-build-mrna-vaccine-manufacturing-site-singapore/,BioNTech to build mRNA vaccine manufacturing site in Singapore,"BioNTech plans to set up a regional center and a new factory in Singapore for its vaccines, it said on Monday, May 10 boosting its presence in Asia as a debate over patents rages and pressure grows on drugmakers to raise output of COVID-19 shots.
Governments are looking to build up local vaccine production to secure access to supplies after manufacturing setbacks have slowed the rollout of COVID-19 doses in some countries.
The Singapore facility will “address potential pandemic threats” in southeast Asia and will increase BioNTech’s global supply capacity of product candidates – also beyond vaccines – based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, BionTech said.
MRNA vaccines, like BionTech and Pfizer’s COVID-19 shot, prompt the human body to make a protein that is part of the virus, triggering an immune response.
The German biotech company said the Singapore factory will have an estimated annual capacity of several hundred million doses of its mRNA vaccines depending on the specific type, once it is operational in 2023.
“Having multiple nodes in our production network is an important strategic step in building out our global footprint and capabilities,” said Ugur Sahin, CEO and co-founder of BioNTech.
He told a press conference that the investment amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars, declining to be more specific.
BioNTech Chief Strategy Officer Ryan Richardson said there were ongoing discussions with countries around the world about more production sites but added the Singapore decision was exceptional.
“We made a unique long-term commitment to Singapore,” following more than a year of talks with the country, he added.
Leading vaccine makers have come under growing pressure to free up their COVID-19 vaccine patents to aid poor countries. BioNTech and other vaccine makers have said they were already transferring vital production knowledge to other parts of the world.
BioNTech and Pfizer are jointly commercializing the vaccine worldwide, excluding China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which are covered by BioNTech’s collaboration with Fosun Pharma.
BioNTech and Fosun Pharma have done clinical trials in China but Fosun had not started producing the vaccine, which has yet to be granted approval there.
Fosun said on Sunday, May 9, it would provide a factory with an annual capacity to make up to 1 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine under a joint venture with BioNTech.
This marks a step closer for China to have localized manufacturing capability for the German firm’s vaccine. Five domestically-developed COVID-19 vaccines are being used in the country, while no foreign ones have gained regulatory approval.
BioNTech plans to open the Singapore office in 2021 and expects the manufacturing site to be operational by 2023, creating up to 80 jobs in Singapore.
The establishment of a southeast Asia regional hub, which is supported by the Singapore Economic Development Board, comes after BioNTech, based in Mainz, Germany, set up a US headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2020.
BioNTech has said it and Pfizer would have capacity to produce up to 3 billion doses in 2021. Pfizer said last week the pair was targeting production of 4 billion doses next year, mostly for low- and middle-income countries.",Reuters,"May 10, 2021 10:50 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/valneva-covid-19-vaccine-french-shot-variant-proof/,"What’s the Valneva COVID-19 vaccine, the French shot supposed to be ‘variant proof?’","A COVID-19 vaccine from French company Valneva has yet to complete clinical trials. But it has caught the eye of governments in the UK, Europe, and Australia.
One of the vaccine’s main selling points is its apparent ability to mount a more general immune response against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, rather than rely on the spike protein to do this.
This means the vaccine is more likely to be effective against the type of virus variants we’ve already seen emerging, and may emerge in the future. Some reports describe it as “variant proof.”
The hope is vaccines using this technology would be able to provide protection for longer, rather than keep being reformulated to get ahead of these new variants.
Valneva’s vaccine, called VLA2001, is based on tried and tested vaccine technology. It’s the technology used in the vaccine against poliovirus and in some types of flu vaccines. And the company already has a commercially available Japanese encephalitis vaccine based on the same technology.
VLA2001 uses an inactivated version of the whole virus, which cannot replicate or cause disease. The virus is inactivated using a chemical called beta-propiolactone or BPL. This is widely used to inactivate other viruses for vaccines. It was even used to make experimental versions of vaccines against SARS-CoV, the virus that caused SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).
This type of inactivation is expected to preserve the structure of the viral proteins, as they would occur in nature. This means the immune system will be presented with something similar to what occurs naturally, and mount a strong immune response.
After being inactivated, the vaccine would be highly purified. Then, an adjuvant (an immune stimulant) is added to induce a strong immune response.
VLA2001 isn’t the first inactivated vaccine against COVID-19. Leading COVID-19 inactivated vaccines, such as those developed by Sinopharm and Bharat Biotech, have been approved for use in China and received emergency approval in other countries, including India.
However, VLA2001 is the only COVID-19 vaccine candidate using whole inactivated virus in clinical trials in the UK and in mainland Europe.
This approach to vaccine development presents the immune system with all of the structural components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, not just the spike protein, as many other COVID-19 vaccines do.
So Valneva’s vaccine is thought to produce a more broadly protective immune response. That is, antibodies and cells of the immune system are able to recognize and neutralize more pieces of the virus than just the spike protein.
As a result, Valneva’s vaccine could be more effective at tackling emerging COVID-19 virus variants and, if approved, play a useful role as a booster vaccine.
Valneva’s vaccine can be stored at standard cold-chain conditions (2-8℃) and is expected to be given as two shots.
According to the company, no safety concerns or serious adverse events were associated with VLA2001 in early-stage clinical trials.
VLA2001 was given as a low, medium, or high dose in these trials with all participants in the high-dose group generating antibodies to the virus spike protein.
One measure of immune response in the high-dose group after completing the two doses indicated antibody levels were, after two weeks, at least as high as those seen in patients naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, VLA2001 induced immune responses against a number of virus proteins (including the spike protein) across all participants, an encouraging sign the vaccine can provide broad protection against COVID-19.
The vaccine has since advanced to phase 3 clinical trials in the UK. The trial, which started in April 2021, will compare its safety and efficacy with the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The phase 3 trial is expected to be completed by the northern hemisphere’s autumn this year. And if successful, would be submitted for regulatory approval after that.
Despite phase 3 clinical trials only just starting, the UK government has pre-ordered more than 100 million doses of the vaccine from Valneva, with the option of buying more down the track. If trials prove successful and pass regulatory approval, this means the vaccine could be used as a booster in time for this year’s northern hemisphere’s winter.
Australia has confirmed it’s also in talks with Valeneva about importing the vaccine. Some countries in Europe are also reportedly keen to strike a deal.
As new cases of COVID-19 increase globally, we’ll continue to see new viral variants emerge that threaten to escape the protection existing vaccines offer.
Already, we are seeing vaccines from companies such as Moderna and Novavax begin to reformulate their spike protein-based vaccines to get ahead of emerging variants.
So Valneva’s vaccine, with the potential to elicit a more broadly protective immune response, may prove to be a useful tool to combat the rise of the virus and its mutations. However, whether the vaccine is really “variant proof” or merely less affected by emerging variants remains to be seen. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/united-states-backed-vaccine-patent-waiver-pros-cons-explained/,US-backed vaccine patent waiver: Pros and cons explained,"The Biden administration has now agreed to back a proposal to suspend intellectual property protection for COVID vaccines. This is a break from US government’s long-held position on strong intellectual property protection, which has also been supported by many research-intensive countries in western Europe as well and the pharmaceutical industry.
These protections are codified in the World Trade Organization’s Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreements. India, South Africa, and many other emerging economies have been pushing for a waiver from patent protection, and have been supported in this effort by the director general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
While the waiver cannot be put into place until other WHO members agree (at which point manufacturers can presumably start production without any licensing agreements), more and more countries that were previously opposed to the deal, including France and New Zealand, are also now indicating their support. It could be a matter of time before the proposal goes into effect.
So what are the pros and cons of this waiver and what are the alternatives?
The primary concern remains that while the COVID-19 vaccines now thankfully exist, their distribution across the world is not even, despite the existence of the COVAX network: a global effort to share vaccines between countries.
At the time of writing, 44% of the US population and 51% of the UK population are vaccinated, but these percentages are woefully much lower in many developing economies with India at 9.4% and all of Asia and Africa at 4.4% and below 1% respectively.
The intent behind the push for the waiver is of course well intended – to remove any bottlenecks due to intellectual property protections and ramp up the production and distribution of these vaccines in the rest of the world.
The question remains as to whether the bottlenecks in COVID vaccine production are due to intellectual property protection. Typically, we think of patent protection leading to high prices and reduced output as monopolies tend to set prices well above the marginal cost of production to maximise profits.
But high prices do not seem to be the problem here. This is not the same situation as the $750 dollar pill, Daraprim, bought by “pharma bro” Martin Shrekeli.
Vaccines are priced far more reasonably even if all countries do not pay the same price for them. So even if companies like Pfizer are making profits, would removing the IP protection increase production and distribution in the developing world?
If IP protection is waived, perhaps some immediate relief in terms of production and distribution could follow if more manufacturers in emerging economies can join in and allocate resources to vaccine production immediately.
However, in addition to waiving legal protections, manufacturers in emerging economies need to be supported with the technology to actually produce the vaccines. This may be particularly true of the newer mRNA vaccines such as those from Pfizer and Moderna, which are difficult to manufacture, but may equally apply to adenovirus vaccines such as the one produced by AstraZeneca.
While opening up the possibility of production via the waiver may be a start, it is not a guarantee that enough manufacturers will be found to take up production. This type of technology transfer may be best achieved via voluntary licences – in which originators provide manufacturers with the know-how to produce their vaccines – as has already been done by AstraZenca.
One might then ask, where is the harm in trying even if this does not work? The trouble is in maintaining incentives for the future. After all, the reason we created patent protections in the first place is to provide incentives via short-term monopoly profits so that firms and individuals can invest in innovation. The monopoly creates inefficiencies, which we tolerate in exchange for technical progress.
If intellectual property protection is waived in the face of a public emergency, even as a one-off, will firms invest next time there is a similar emergency? The fact that Pfizer reaped millions in profits is beside the point. What is more relevant is how much more we benefited from the vaccines through saving lives, reducing suffering, and opening up the economy (when we eventually do).
Setting aside intellectual property protection can be a dangerous precedent, particularly if it may not work.
So what can be done to alleviate the production problem globally? Voluntary licenses are a start. Along the same lines, the US could just buy the patents from the current manufacturers outright based on their discounted future value, and then make them available to manufacturers world over.
These purchases could be done not just for the patents, but also for providing assistance for technology transfer. This would maintain incentives for research, development and innovation, and at the same time protect populations around the world and in the US from the rise of variants that may be able to evade the vaccines we have. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/science-solitaire-why-each-got-more-from-mom-than-dad/,[Science Solitaire] Why each of us got more from Mom than we did from Dad,"Each of us is a mix of what our parents gave us. That applies to how they raised us and the initial genetic pack they passed on to us – our DNA. But in terms of DNA, you have to know that you got more DNA from your mother than from your father – all of us did.
At the center of each of your trillions of cells are intertwined fibers called DNA. One strand comes from Mom and the other, from Dad. But outside the center of a cell are other cellular parts. One of them is the mitochondrion, which serves as the “power plant” of your cell. We have many mitochondria in each of our cells. Each mitochondrion also houses DNA, albeit much smaller and containing fewer genes than nuclear DNA. That DNA is called mDNA, which, as you would expect, scientists named as such to stand for “mitochondrial DNA,” but which might as well also mean “mom DNA,” because ONLY mothers can pass it on to their children.
Whether you are a son or a daughter, your mom passes on her mDNA to you. So men also have their mDNA, but somehow it “decays” in their possession, and so they never get to pass it on. Only women are able to “preserve” mDNA to be passed on.
This is one of the fundamental ways family tree services can put your family line together when you give them your DNA sample. They get your mDNA, which gives direct evidence of the chain of life traced through your mother’s line.
This is also how scientists were able to trace the entire history of modern humans – all of us living now – back to one common maternal genetic ancestor. They tagged this ancestor “Mitochondrial Eve,” and while the term loads it up with religious meaning, it has to be clarified that it did not mean that there was one individual female who gave birth to thousands and so on and so forth. But yes, it grounds our sense of humanity – that we are ALL connected in a very fundamental way in nature – across time, across distances, across political, religious, and social boundaries.
Just like the more popularly known DNA, mDNA also has genes, but a lot fewer. DNA has about 25,000 genes while mDNA has about 37. These 37 genes code for functions that have to do with powering your cells, which is how we are able to function. But like the better known DNA, it mutates as it is passed on. Mutations are small changes that happen as they are passed on. These changes, even if they are small, may sometimes spell maladies that affect your health.
So that is why your mother gets an additional shoutout if you were to give thanks to her genetic gift pack. But you must know that mDNA is passed on NOT ONLY by human mothers but also by “mothers” in animals, plants, and fungi, which are comprised of many cells like us humans. In fact, mDNA was first found in 1963 in chicks, by a married couple who were both scientists, Margit and Sylvan Nass.
This makes mDNA one of nature’s ancient keys to continuity – like if you had a quilt that is passed on from one generation to another through the maternal line, with each generation doing their own quilted contributions on the basic quilt.
My mother’s face, her powerhouse of inner energy, among many other things, are undoubtedly imprinted in me. She cares very little about the science of anything, but gave birth to someone like me who is passionate about it more than any other thing she wishes I were interested in. So Mom, thank you for the extra gene pack, but much more, thank you for giving me life to ponder the mystery.",Maria Isabel Garcia,"May 9, 2021 11:00 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/who-gives-emergency-approval-to-sinopharm-first-chinese-covid-19-vaccine/,WHO approves Sinopharm vaccine in potential boost to COVAX pipeline,"The World Health Organization (WHO) approved for emergency use a COVID-19 vaccine from China’s state-owned drugmaker Sinopharm on Friday, May 7, bolstering Beijing’s push for a bigger role in inoculating the world.
The vaccine, one of two main Chinese coronavirus vaccines that have been given to hundreds of millions of people in China and elsewhere, is the first developed by a non-Western country to win WHO backing.
It is also the first time the WHO has given emergency use approval to a Chinese vaccine for any infectious disease. Earlier this week, separate WHO experts had expressed concern about the quality of data the company provided on side effects.
A WHO emergency listing is a signal to national regulators that a product is safe and effective. It also allows it to be included in COVAX, a global program to provide vaccines mainly for poor countries, which has hit supply problems.
“This expands the list of COVID-19 vaccines that COVAX can buy, and gives countries confidence to expedite their own regulatory approval, and to import and administer a vaccine,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing.
Senior WHO adviser Bruce Aylward said it would be up to Sinopharm to say how many doses of its vaccine it can provide to the program, but added: “They are looking at trying to provide substantial support, make substantial doses available while at the same time of course trying to serve China’s population.”
The WHO had already given emergency approval to COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and, last week, Moderna.
“This…signifies that the quality, safety, efficacy and accessibility of Sinopharm CNBG’s COVID-19 vaccine meet the requirements of WHO standards, which will contribute more Chinese power to the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic,” Sinopharm said in a social media statement published on Saturday, May 8.
The decision to approve Sinopharm’s vaccine was taken by WHO’s technical advisory group, which met since April 26 to review the latest clinical data and manufacturing practices.
“Its easy storage requirements make it highly suitable for low-resource settings,” a WHO statement said.
Tedros said that, following the approval, its separate Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) had recommended that adults over 18 receive two doses of the Sinopharm vaccine.
“On the basis of all available evidence, WHO recommends the vaccine for adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of three to four weeks,” the WHO said in a statement.
The vaccine, developed by Beijing Biological Products Institute, a unit of Sinopharm subsidiary China National Biotec Group, has an estimated efficacy of 79% for all age groups, it said.
Alejandro Craviato, SAGE panel chair, said: “The information we have for people over 60 is still very scarce. There is no reason to think the vaccine would behave differently in this older age group.”
But noting gaps in clinical data, he said that Sinopharm or national authorities should monitor people over 60, those with comorbidities and pregnant women after vaccination.
The WHO has said it could reach a decision on China’s other main COVID-19 vaccine, made by Sinovac Biotech, next week. The technical experts reviewed it on Wednesday, May 5.
Arnaud Didierlaurent, chair of WHO’s technical advisory group, told the news conference: “We have started to review the report from Sinovac. We actually requested additional information to the manufacturer…which we hope to receive very soon to make a decision.”
Sinopharm, which has two COVID-19 vaccines approved in China, has supplied over 200 million doses at home and abroad, and Sinovac has shipped over 300 million doses of its shot worldwide, including at home. Both companies’ vaccines have been exported to many countries, particularly in Latin America, Asia and Africa, many of which have had difficulty securing supplies of vaccines developed in the West.",Reuters,"May 7, 2021 11:38 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/britain-says-under-40s-offered-alternative-astrazeneca-vaccine/,UK says under-40s should be offered alternative to AstraZeneca vaccine,"British officials said on Friday, May 7, people under 40 should be offered an alternative to Oxford/AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine where possible due to a small risk of blood clots, given the low number of cases and the availability of other shots.
AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 shot, developed by Oxford University, has resulted in reports of rare blood clots with low platelet levels that occur more commonly in younger adults. Some countries have advised the shot be given only to older people.
Officials emphasized the benign domestic conditions that provided the context for the decision, on the same day that Germany went the other direction and made the shot available to all adults who might want it.
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said the advice reflected low levels of COVID-19 infection in Britain and the availability of other vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna.
Officials said Britain would still offer a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine to all adults by the end of July, and emphasized it was better for people in the age group to receive AstraZeneca’s shot if no other one was available.
“As COVID-19 rates continue to come under control, we are advising that adults aged 18–39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, if available and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine,” said Wei Shen Lim, COVID-19 Chair for JCVI.
“The advice is specific to circumstances in the UK at this time and maximizes use of the wide portfolio of vaccines available.”
Previously, advice was only for people under 30 to be offered an alternative vaccine.
The British MHRA medicine regulator has found an incidence of 17.4 clots per million doses of the vaccine among 30 to 39 year olds, compared with 10.5 clots per million doses overall.
There have been 4.5 deaths per million doses for the 30 to 39 year olds, compared to 2.1 deaths from the clots per million doses reported overall.
June Raine, MHRA Chief Executive, said the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine “continue to outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people”.
“The balance of benefits and risks is very favourable for older people, but is more finely balanced for younger people.”
Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy Chief Medical Officer, emphasized that it was important for people to continue to get vaccinated, saying AstraZeneca had contributed to saving thousands of lives and its ease of use was key.
“Because of the deployability of AstraZeneca, (there will) still be a number of patients where it is only practical to offer AstraZeneca to them because of the circumstances,” he told a news conference.
“But on balance, it’s better to make this further course correction,” he said, referring to the new advice.",Reuters,"May 7, 2021 10:19 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/scrapping-gay-sex-bans-key-fighting-hiv/,"Scrapping gay sex bans key to fighting HIV, says UNAIDS ambassador","Scrapping gay sex bans around the world is vital to fighting the spread of HIV because it would encourage more people to get tested, Britain’s former health minister during the 1980s AIDS crisis said on Thursday, May 6.
Norman Fowler, who this month takes up an ambassadorial role at the U.N. agency UNAIDS, said many people are unwilling to come forward for HIV tests in countries that effectively criminalize homosexuality.
“That’s going to have a vast effect upon any population,” Fowler told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview.
“It means they don’t come forward for testing and it means that they come forward far too late for testing.”
Gay sex is illegal in 68 countries worldwide, according to the ILGA advocacy group.
As Britain’s secretary of state for health between 1981 and 1987 during the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Fowler oversaw the country’s first HIV/AIDS awareness program – facing widespread resistance, even from the late PM.
“I’m afraid that she was what these days might be called a sceptic on this whole area,” said Fowler, 83.
“Her position was quite near to a number of the religious leaders who simply said, as much as they said anything, that we should be pursuing a ‘moral’ campaign,” he added.
Thatcher’s concerns stemmed partly from what she saw as the explicit nature of some of Britain’s early HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns, which began in 1986.
An initial proposal for an advert mentioned “risky sex”, which Fowler said Thatcher thought “would offend people and … tell young people things about which they knew nothing, with the implication that it would encourage them”.
Thatcher’s skepticism was indicative of attitudes towards gay men and the wider LGBT+ community at the time, recently highlighted in the hit British television series “It’s A Sin”, which Fowler praised for its accurate depiction of the era.
While gay sex was partially decriminalized in England and Wales in 1967, there was still an unequal male age of consent up until 2001.
Famously, Queen Victoria’s refusal to believe lesbians existed meant that the age of consent for straight and gay women remained equal.
In 1988, when Thatcher was still prime minister, her Conservative administration passed a law banning local authorities from “promoting” homosexuality.
Fowler supported the legislation, which was overturned in England and Wales in 2003, and later also voted against a possible equalization of the age of consent at 16.
He said he regretted both decisions.
“That was a mistake,” he said. “And I’ve never made any bones about that.”
In his new role at UNAIDS, which he takes up after stepping down as the speaker of Britain’s upper parliamentary chamber on April 30, he will be focused on highlighting the battle to combat AIDS as COVID-19 dominates global health concerns.
“There’s a real danger that the world is going to forget about the crisis and problem of AIDS because obviously the COVID issue is foremost in people’s minds,” Fowler said.
“But the fact is that AIDS – in spite of all the heroic efforts that have been made over the past 20 years – remains an enormous problem.”
While anti-HIV/AIDS measures have seen transmission rates plummet in more developed countries, 1.7 million people were newly infected with HIV in 2019, according to UNAIDS.
Globally, more than 38 million are living with the virus.
“The issue of AIDS remains a very central one, and although it may not be as evident in Europe, it certainly remains very evident in whole swathes of the world,” Fowler said.",Thomson Reuters Foundation,"May 6, 2021 11:32 PM PHT"

The independent experts on the WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) reviewed Sinovac’s CoronaVac jab from phase 3 clinical trials in China, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and Chile.
The assessment came shortly after WHO SAGE experts had voiced “very low confidence” in data provided by Chinese state-owned drugmaker Sinopharm on its COVID-19 vaccine regarding the risk of serious side-effects in some patients, but overall confidence in its ability to prevent the disease, a document seen by Reuters showed.
The Sinovac vaccine has been authorized in 32 countries and jurisdictions, with 260 million doses distributed, the SAGE experts said.
“We are very confident that two doses of CoronaVac are efficacious in preventing PCR confirmed COVID19 in adults (18-59 years),” SAGE said in an assessment posted on the WHO website.
It cited evidence gaps in safety in pregnancy, and on safety and clinical protection in older adults, those with underlying disease, and evaluation of rare adverse events detected through post-authorization safety monitoring.
The experts said they had a “moderate level of confidence” that the risk of serious adverse effects was low in people aged 59 and less, but had a “low level of confidence” in the quality of evidence that such risk was also low for adults above 60.
“We have low confidence in the quality of evidence that the risk of serious adverse events in individuals with comorbidities or health states that increase risk for severe COVID-19 following one or two doses of CoronaVac is low,” they added.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/novavax-vaccine-51-percent-efficacy-south-african-variant/,Novavax vaccine shows 51% efficacy against South African variant – study,"Novavax Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine had efficacy of 51% against infections caused by the South African variant among people who were HIV negative, and 43% in a group that included people who were HIV positive, according to a new analysis published on Wednesday, May 5.
The variant, known as B.1.351, carries mutations that threaten the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, several studies have shown. Most vaccine makers, including Novavax, are testing versions of their vaccines to protect against emerging variants.
The Novavax post-hoc analysis was published in the New England Journal of Medicine along with full data from the company’s trial in South Africa, which included nearly 2,700 volunteers who had not been previously infected with the coronavirus.
Results announced in January showed efficacy of 60.1% against symptomatic COVID-19 in the South African trial looking at a mixture of the original virus and the South African variant among those who were HIV-negative. Efficacy was 49.4% among a mixed group of HIV positive and HIV negative participants.
The study also showed that prior infection with an earlier version of the virus did not reduce the risk of COVID-19 caused by the South African variant among people who got placebo shots.
The average age of trial volunteers was 32. Most cases were mild-to-moderate.
The study did not provide data on efficacy of the Novavax vaccine in preventing severe disease or hospitalization, “one of the most important factors in determining the usefulness of a vaccine,” said Dr Peter English, a retired consultant in communicable disease control and former chair of the British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee.
“Most vaccines are less effective at preventing mild disease than they are at preventing severe disease; so this vaccine could turn out to be much more effective at preventing hospital admissions and deaths – we simply don’t know, yet,” said English, who was not involved in the study.
The trial’s main goals were to test how the vaccine performed in people who were HIV negative, as well as those who were HIV positive and medically stable. Among those evaluated, 94% were HIV negative and 6% were HIV positive.
John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York who was not involved in the study, said he is not surprised efficacy was lower among volunteers with HIV, a virus that attacks the immune system.

There was no immediate reply from the World Health Organization to a query about any concerns linked to the Sinopharm vaccine, BBIBP-CorV. In Beijing, Sinopharm was not immediately reachable for comment outside working hours.
The “evidence assessment” document was prepared by the WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) for its review scheduled this week of the Sinopharm shot, authorized by 45 countries and jurisdictions for use in adults, with 65 million doses administered. The experts review evidence and give recommendations on policy and dosages associated with a vaccine.
The document includes summaries of data from clinical trials in China, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
Vaccine efficacy in multi-country Phase 3 clinical trials was 78.1% after two doses, the document said. This was a slight drop from 79.34% announced previously in China.
“We are very confident that 2 doses of BBIBP-CorV are efficacious in preventing PCR confirmed COVID19 in adults (18-59 years),” the document said.
But it added: “Analysis of safety amongst participants with comorbidities (was) limited by the low number of participants with comorbidities (other than obesity) in the Phase 3 trial.”
Among “evidence gaps”, it cited data on protection against severe disease, duration of protection, safety for use in pregnant women and in older adults and identification/evaluation of rare adverse events through post-authorization safety monitoring.
“We have very low confidence in the quality of evidence that the risk of serious adverse events following one or two doses of BBIBP-CorV in older adults (≥60 years) is low,” it said.
“We have very low confidence in the quality of evidence that the risk of serious adverse events in individuals with comorbidities or health states that increase risk for severe COVID-19 following one or two doses of BBIBP-CorV is low,” it added.
The SAGE analysis was prepared as a WHO technical advisory group currently reviews the vaccine for an emergency use approval, which would not only pave the way for its use in the global COVAX vaccine sharing platform but also provide a crucial international endorsement for a vaccine developed in China.

Data on the vaccine, COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell) Inactivated, will be assessed as they are made available to help speed up potential approvals, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said.
This is the first Chinese vaccine the EMA is studying in real-time, and the fourth COVID-19 vaccine under such a review, including those from CureVac, Novavax Inc and Russia’s Sputnik V.
Sinovac’s vaccine has shown efficacy rates between 50% and 90% in different studies and is currently authorized for use in China, Indonesia, Brazil and Turkey.
The vaccine contains inactivated or dead versions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to help the human body’s immune system make antibodies.
In early April, Sinovac said its third production plant for its vaccine, branded CoronaVac in some regions, was ready, doubling its annual capacity to 2 billion doses. The firm said more than 200 million doses of Sinovac’s vaccine have been delivered globally.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/are-chemicals-shrinking-penis-depleting-sperm/,Are chemicals shrinking your penis and depleting your sperm?,"A doomsday scenario of an end to human sperm production has been back in the news recently, now with the added threat of shrinking penises.
Professor Shanna Swan, a US epidemiologist who studies environmental influences on human development, recently published a new book called Countdown.
In it, she suggests sperm counts could reach zero by 2045, largely owing to the impact of a range of environmental pollutants used in manufacturing everyday products: phthalates and bisphosphenol A (BPA) from plastics, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) used, for example, in waterproofing. Under this scenario, she says, most couples wanting to conceive would need to rely on assisted reproductive technologies.
She has also warned these chemicals are shrinking penis size.
Such extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I would argue the evidence is not strong enough.
Epidemiologists find associations between disease and potential contributing factors, like lung cancer and smoking. But their work can’t identify the causes of disease — just because two things are associated doesn’t mean one is causing, or caused by, the other.
An article written by environmental activist Erin Brockovich in The Guardian in March leads by referring to “hormone-disrupting chemicals that are decimating fertility.” But causation is far from established.
It’s reasonable to expect chemicals that affect hormone function in our bodies, like BPA and PFAS, could affect reproduction in males and females, given available evidence. But we don’t have irrefutable proof.
In 2017, Swan and several colleagues published an exhaustive review study showing an apparent drop in men’s sperm counts of 59.3% between 1973 and 2011. This research informs the arguments Swan makes in Countdown and those we’ve seen in the media.
What’s not often mentioned is the fact the researchers only observed a decline in sperm count in groups of men from North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, but not in groups of men from South America, Asia, or Africa.
When Swan and her colleagues combined the data from all countries, they saw a decline because the studies of “Western” men outweigh those of men elsewhere (in the number of studies and participants).
Swan and her colleagues worked hard to avoid bias when conducting their study. But selection bias (related to how study participants are chosen), publication bias (resulting from researchers’ tendency to report only observations they think will be of interest) and other limitations of the original work used as the basis for their investigation could be influencing the results of the larger study.
Many studies from different parts of the world show declining sperm counts, which is concerning, but we don’t fully understand the reasons for the apparent decline. Blaming chemicals in the environment overlooks other important factors such as chronic disease, diet, and obesity, which people can act on to improve their fertility.
Swan’s 2017 study boils down to a straight descending line drawn between sperm counts of groups of men studied at different times between 1973 and 2011.
Just because a straight line can be drawn through the data, this doesn’t justify extrapolation of that line beyond its earliest and latest data points. It’s unscientific to assume trends in data exist outside the range of observations.
We know sperm counts of men in the early 1940s were around 113 million sperm per ml of semen, not the roughly 140 million/ml you get from extrapolating backwards from Swan’s research. Concluding sperm counts will reach zero in 2045, based on extrapolating forward from the available data, is just as likely to be incorrect.
When Swan told news website Axios “If you look at the curve on sperm count and project it forward” she was encouraging unjustifiable and unscientific interpretation of her data — even though she acknowledged it was “risky” to extrapolate in this way. Unfortunately this caution is too often unmentioned.
For example, Brockovich writes: “That would mean no babies. No reproduction. No more humans.” That’s hyperbole. It’s just not science.
Claims of shrinking penises are obvious clickbait. But only a single study, of 383 young men from the Veneto region in northeastern Italy, links men’s penis size to the types of chemicals Swan attributes to declining sperm counts.
Within Veneto there are geographic zones with varied levels of PFAS contamination. A group of 212 men who live in areas with high or intermediate PFAS exposure and have high levels of these chemicals in their bodies, had an average penis length of 8.6cm, about 10% lower than the average of a group of 171 men from an area without exposure (9.7cm).
But a few features of this study affect the reliability of the observations and whether we can generalize them to other populations.
And from a semantic perspective, for penises to be “shrinking” they must be getting shorter over time, on either an individual or population basis. I cannot find any reports of men’s penises shortening as a consequence of environmental pollution. Available data don’t suggest a decline in penis size over the past few decades.
While environmental pollution is a pressing concern, the evidence suggests the catastrophic collapse of human reproduction and accompanying penis shrinkage is thankfully a pretty unlikely prospect. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

The Imperial College-led study, which looked at immune responses among healthcare workers in Britain after their first dose of the Pfizer shot, found that those who had previously had mild or asymptomatic infection had enhanced protection against more infectious mutated variants that emerged in Britain and South Africa.
But the immune response after a first dose of the shot was weaker in people who had not previously been infected, potentially leaving them at risk from such variants, researchers leading the work said.
“This study highlights the importance of getting second doses of the vaccine rolled out to protect the population,” said Rosemary Boyton, a professor of immunology and respiratory medicine at Imperial who co-led the study.
“People who have had their first dose of vaccine and who have not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2 are not fully protected against the circulating ‘variants of concern’.”
The research, published in the journal Science, analyzed blood samples for the presence and levels of immunity against the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the so-called UK variant, known as B117, and another known as B1351 that emerged in South Africa.
It found that, after a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, a boosted immune response in the shape of T-cells, B-cells and neutralizing antibodies was associated with prior infection.
In people who had not had COVID-19, however, a single vaccine dose produced lower levels of neutralizing antibodies against the original virus and its mutant variants.
Danny Altmann, an Imperial professor of immunology who co-led the study, said this meant there would be a “window of vulnerability” for people between their first and second doses.",Reuters,"May 1, 2021 9:50 AM PHT"

“The objective is to make medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency,” the WHO said in a statement.
WHO Assistant Director-General Mariangela Simao said on Friday it was important to have more vaccines available because of supply problems for other shots, including from India, a main source of vaccines for the global COVAX vaccine sharing program. India has restricted exports because of a crisis of infections.
Moderna announced this week an expansion plan for its production network to boost its capacity to up to 3 billion doses in 2022.
The WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) already in January had recommended Moderna’s vaccine for all age groups 18 and above.

The vaccine shipment, produced at Pfizer’s Kalamazoo, Michigan plant, marks the first time the drugmaker has delivered abroad from US facilities after a Trump-era restriction on dose exports expired at the end of March, the source said.
The US government has been under mounting pressure in recent weeks to provide surplus vaccines to other nations desperately in need as it makes swift progress vaccinating its own residents. Many countries where the virus is still rampant are struggling to acquire vaccine supplies to help tame the pandemic.
Wealthy governments have been trying to stock up on COVID-19 shots from Pfizer and Moderna Inc because of their extremely high efficacy and after safety concerns and production problems temporarily sidelined vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson.
Pfizer has shipped more than 10 million doses to Mexico so far, becoming its largest supplier of COVID-19 vaccine.
Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE have been supplying other countries with doses from its main European production plant in Belgium.
Mexico’s health ministry said it is receiving 2 million doses from Pfizer this week. It has received more than a million doses from Belgium since Wednesday and expects around another million this week. Reuters could not confirm if all the remaining Pfizer doses would come from Michigan.
Pfizer will use extra capacity in its US facilities to deliver shots abroad while continuing to meet its commitment to supply the United States, the source said, adding that the drugmaker will also make shipments from Belgium.
Pfizer has said it will be making up to 25 million shots each week in the United States by mid-year, which is more than it needs to meet its commitment to deliver 300 million doses to the United States by the end of July.
The company expects to produce as many as 2.5 billion vaccine doses in 2021 and already has agreements to supply more than a billion to governments around the world.
A deal Pfizer signed with the White House last year had barred it from shipping doses made in the United States to other countries until after March 31, according to the source and a US official, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press.
The US vaccination campaign has been among the quickest and most successful in the world, with nearly 240 million shots administered to more than 140 million residents so far, according to federal data updated on Thursday.
The White House on Monday, April 26, said it would export up to 60 million doses of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine that have been made in a US facility to countries in need.
Officials said on Monday the United States no longer anticipates needing the AstraZeneca vaccine to meet its goal of having enough shots for all Americans by summer.
The US government on Sunday said it will immediately ship raw materials for COVID-19 vaccines, medical equipment and protective gear to India, which has become the latest epicenter of the pandemic with its health system on the brink of collapse. It has not yet promised finished vaccine shipments to India.",Reuters,"Apr 30, 2021 12:52 PM PHT"

It also said it is increasing its expectations for 2021 vaccine production to between 800 million and 1 billion shots, raising the bottom of its range from 700 million.
The final number of inoculations will depend on how many are lower-dose formulations for boosters and immunizations for children. Moderna shots currently deploy 100 micrograms of vaccine substance but some future shots may use only 50 micrograms.
“As we look forward to next year, we just see so much need for primary vaccine, we are hearing it all over the world, and also boosters,” Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in an interview.
“So depending upon… how much the ordering that happens is third doses or pediatric doses at 50 micrograms, we could see up to 3 billion doses,” he added. Moderna had previously said it expected to make 1.4 billion shots in 2022.
Moderna also said new data suggests its shots can be stored safely for up to 3 months at refrigerator temperatures, making it easier to get them to hard to reach areas that may not have access to freezers. “That might be a breakthrough that really matters in 2022 in Africa and across lower and middle income countries,” Hoge said.
Wealthy governments have been trying to stock up on COVID-19 shots from Moderna and Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE after safety concerns and production problems temporarily sidelined vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson.
But even as rich countries speed up their vaccine rollouts, other parts of the world are facing sharp upticks in cases and struggling to acquire needed shots.
India has recorded more than 300,000 cases each day and more than 2,000 deaths in the past week. Fewer than 10% of its more than 1.3 billion citizens have received one dose and only around 20 million are fully inoculated against the virus.
Moderna expects to double output at a drug substance plant in Switzerland run by Lonza Group AG and boost production in a Spain-based facility owned by Laboratorios Farmaceuticos ROVI SA more than two-fold. US plants will also raise output by more than 50%.
Moderna’s two-dose vaccine uses messenger-RNA technology that programs cells to build immunity to the novel coronavirus.
The US drugmaker said it would begin making investments this year and that production boosts would start in late 2021 and carry into early 2022.
Moderna said it is in advanced talks for additional deals with other manufacturers to help make its shots. Moderna earlier this month announced shot production deals with Sanofi SA and Catalent Inc.
The company would need regulatory sign-off to start shipping vaccine at the higher, refrigerator-level temperatures.
So far, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca have been the only major global drugmakers with authorized COVID-19 shots that can be stored without a freezer.
Both companies have faced production problems and reports of severe side effects that have slowed uptake of their vaccines.
Moderna Inc said on Wednesday the US government had agreed to increase the contract for the company’s COVID-19 vaccine by $236 million to roughly $1.25 billion, to include additional costs related to the shot’s studies.",Reuters,"Apr 29, 2021 2:03 PM PHT"

The length of time children spend viewing digital screens has been exacerbated by a massive increase in remote schooling, directly contributing to further increases in childhood myopia. Home-schooled children of the COVID-19 era are at risk of becoming the visually compromised population of tomorrow.
A recent study of more than 120,000 children in China demonstrated that six- to eight-year-olds who were in lockdown for the first six months of 2020 are more myopic than their counterparts from previous years.
For a child with myopia, distance vision is blurry while near vision remains clear. In the past, the increase in myopia diagnoses from year to year was given little thought, since it was correctable with glasses or contact lenses. However, eye-care professionals now know that the younger a child becomes myopic, the higher their prescription may eventually become, and high prescriptions are bad news for eyes.
There is an established link between high myopia and increased lifelong risk of devastating eye diseases. Someone who has a prescription of more than six corrective units, or diopters, (a prescription of -6.00) has a 90% likelihood of being visually impaired by the age of 75.
A number of eye conditions are more prevalent in highly myopic adults including cataract, glaucoma, retinal detachment, retinal degeneration, and other ocular diseases that can have a lifelong impact on their vision. These complications typically happen in later life, so concern for children may seem irrelevant or premature. However, there are other more immediate effects of high prescriptions.
A child or teenager with a fairly high prescription will be visually debilitated when not wearing their glasses or contacts, making them totally dependent on their vision correction. As an example, someone who has 10 diopters of myopia sees anything beyond half an arm’s length as blurred. And don’t think that laser vision correction will save the day once they’re old enough. That degree of myopia may leave them ineligible or subject to a less successful outcome.
The question then turns to what causes myopia in the first place, and what can be done about its onset and progression.
The biggest factor that can’t be changed is parental myopia. A child is extremely likely to become myopic if both parents are myopic.
One factor that is modifiable is the amount of time children spend on “near tasks,” those that involve viewing things closer than 40 centimeters from their eyes.
Extended periods of time spent focused on short distances is contributing to myopia increases. Digital screens have been targeted as the reason, but is it the electronic display itself or that a child holds a tablet or phone very close for extended periods? While there is some debate, the short focusing distance is the more likely culprit.
Even with the digital onslaught, all is not lost. Parents and caregivers can help prevent children from becoming nearsighted and slow down the rate at which the condition progresses.
Simply spending more time outside can delay the onset of myopia. Direct sunlight plays a part, as well as the long-range focusing while playing outdoors. Restricting screen time is an option with optometrist-endorsed recommendations relating to screen times for children.
For children schooled at home where limits are not practical, ensure that the screen is not being held or positioned too close to a child, encourage regular breaks and use the 20-20-20 rule: look 20 feet (seven meters) away every 20 minutes for 20 seconds. Some researchers have found that children who go to bed later are more likely to be myopic — an added incentive for parents who are looking for reasons to call it a night.
A child’s myopia usually continues to progress until around the age of 16, but about 10% of myopic patients’ vision keeps worsening into their early 20s.
Many options exist for vision correction, but more importantly, there are an increasing number of options available to slow down the progression of myopia and reduce the risk of developing sight-threatening complications in later life. They range from contact lenses and glasses specifically designed to slow down myopia progression to precisely formulated eye drops.
These can be discussed with your eye-care practitioner, who will recommend the best path based on each child.
More than anything else, do not assume a child can see well. There is no substitution for an examination with an eye-care professional. The pandemic has already caused widespread hardship. By acting now, parents can minimize its impact on the vision and ocular health of generations to come. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/disruptions-immunization-put-millions-children-risk/,Disruptions to immunization put millions of children at risk – UN,"Millions of children whose immunizations have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in Africa, are now at risk from life-threatening diseases such as measles, polio, yellow fever, and diphtheria, UN health agencies warned on Monday, April 26.
Gaps in vaccination coverage have led to serious measles outbreaks in Pakistan and Yemen, the agencies said, and are likely to lead to future epidemics as more regular childhood vaccinations are missed.
“Gaps in vaccination coverage are already having grave, real world consequences,” said the World Health Organization’s (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a virtual briefing in which he also announced a new global immunization strategy.
The strategy aims to reduce by half the number of so-called “zero-dose” children receiving no inoculations from 20 million to 10 million, among other steps.
The WHO director of immunization Kate O’Brien told the same briefing such measures could avert up to 50 million deaths by 2030.
Compared to 2020, some progress has been made in restoring routine vaccinations disrupted by the pandemic. But more than a third of the 135 countries that responded to a WHO survey said they were still experiencing difficulties.
“Even before the pandemic, there were worrying signs that we were beginning to lose ground in the fight against preventable child illness, with 20 million children already missing out on critical vaccinations,” Henrietta Fore, executive director of the UN children’s fund UNICEF, said in a joint statement with the WHO and the GAVI vaccines alliance.
She said the pandemic had “made a bad situation worse.”
The WHO survey found that at least 60 mass immunization campaigns in 50 countries were currently on hold, putting around 228 million people, mostly children, at risk from preventable serious diseases. More than half the affected countries are in Africa.
Immunization programs against measles – one of the world’s most contagious diseases – account for 23 of the postponed campaigns, affecting around 140 million people.",Reuters,"Apr 27, 2021 9:37 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/no-male-or-female-brain-scientists-study-weaker-evidence-sex-differences/,"You don’t have a male or female brain – the more brains scientists study, the weaker the evidence for sex differences","Everyone knows the difference between male and female brains. One is chatty and a little nervous, but never forgets and takes good care of others. The other is calmer, albeit more impulsive, but can tune out gossip to get the job done.
These are stereotypes, of course, but they hold surprising sway over the way actual brain science is designed and interpreted. Since the dawn of MRI, neuroscientists have worked ceaselessly to find differences between men’s and women’s brains. This research attracts lots of attention because it’s just so easy to try to link any particular brain finding to some gender difference in behavior.
But as a neuroscientist long experienced in the field, I recently completed a painstaking analysis of 30 years of research on human brain sex differences. And what I found, with the help of excellent collaborators, is that virtually none of these claims has proven reliable.
Except for the simple difference in size, there are no meaningful differences between men’s and women’s brain structure or activity that hold up across diverse populations. Nor do any of the alleged brain differences actually explain the familiar but modest differences in personality and abilities between men and women.
My colleagues and I titled our study “Dump the Dimorphism” to debunk the idea that human brains are “sexually dimorphic.” That’s a very science-y term biologists use to describe a structure that comes in two distinct forms in males and females, such as antlers on deer or the genitalia of men and women.
When it comes to the brain, some animals do indeed exhibit sexual dimorphism, such as certain birds whose brains contain a song-control nucleus that is six times larger in males and is responsible for male-only courtship singing. But as we demonstrate in our exhaustive survey, nothing in human brains comes remotely close to this.
Yes, men’s overall brain size is about 11% bigger than women’s, but unlike some songbirds, no specific brain areas are disproportionately larger in men or women. Brain size is proportional to body size, and the brain difference between sexes is actually smaller than other internal organs, such as the heart, lungs and kidneys, which range from 17% to 25% larger in men.
When overall size is properly controlled, no individual brain region varies by more than about 1% between men and women, and even these tiny differences are not found consistently across geographically or ethnically diverse populations.
Other highly touted brain sex differences are also a product of size, not sex. These include the ratio of gray matter to white matter and the ratio of connections between, versus within, the two hemispheres of the brain. Both of these ratios are larger in people with smaller brains, whether male or female.
What’s more, recent research has utterly rejected the idea that the tiny difference in connectivity between left and right hemispheres actually explains any behavioral difference between men and women.
Still, “sexual dimorphism” won’t die. It’s a zombie concept, with the latest revival using artificial intelligence to predict whether a given brain scan comes from a man or woman.
Computers can do this with 80% to 90% accuracy except, once again, this accuracy falls to 60% (or not much better than a coin flip) when you properly control for head size. More troublesome is that these algorithms don’t translate across populations, such as European versus Chinese. Such inconsistency shows there are no universal features that discriminate male and female brains in humans – unlike those deer antlers.
Neuroscientists have long held out hope that bigger studies and better methods would finally uncover the “real” or species-wide sex differences in the brain. But the truth is, as studies have gotten bigger, the sex effects have gotten smaller.
This collapse is a telltale sign of a problem known as publication bias. Small, early studies which found a significant sex difference were likelier to get published than research finding no male-female brain difference.
We must be doing something right, because our challenge to the dogma of brain sex has received pushback from both ends of the academic spectrum. Some have labeled us as science “deniers” and deride us for political correctness. On the other extreme, we are dismissed by women’s health advocates, who believe research has overlooked women’s brains – and that neuroscientists should intensify our search for sex differences to better treat female-dominant disorders, such as depression and Alzheimer’s disease.
But there’s no denying the decades of actual data, which show that brain sex differences are tiny and swamped by the much greater variance in individuals’ brain measures across the population. And the same is true for most behavioral measures.
[Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.]
About a decade ago, teachers were urged to separate boys and girls for math and English classes based on the sexes’ alleged learning differences. Fortunately, many refused, arguing the range of ability is always much greater among boys or among girls than between each gender as a group.
In other words, sex is a very imprecise indicator of what kind of brain a person will have. Another way to think about it is every individual brain is a mosaic of circuits that control the many dimensions of masculinity and femininity, such as emotional expressiveness, interpersonal style, verbal and analytic reasoning, sexuality, and gender identity itself.
Or, to use a computer analogy, gendered behavior comes from running different software on the same basic hardware.
The absence of binary brain sex features also resonates with the increasing numbers of people who identify as nonbinary, queer, nonconforming or transgender. Whatever influence biological sex exerts directly on human brain circuitry is clearly not sufficient to explain the multidimensional behaviors we lump under the complex phenomenon of gender.
Rather than “dimorphic,” the human brain is a sexually monomorphic organ – much more like the heart, kidneys and lungs. As you may have noticed, these can be transplanted between women and men with great success. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/environmental-dna-tool-used-to-detect-endangered-wildlife-helping-fight-covid-19-pandemic/,Environmental DNA – how a tool used to detect endangered wildlife ended up helping fight the COVID-19 pandemic,"Imagine discovering an animal species you thought had gone extinct was still living – without laying eyes on it. Such was the case with the Brazilian frog species Megaelosia bocainensis, whose complete disappearance in 1968 led scientists to believe it had become extinct. But through a novel genetic detection technique, it was rediscovered in 2020.
Such discoveries are now possible thanks to a new approach that recovers and reads the trace amounts of DNA released into the environment by animals. It’s called environmental DNA, or eDNA – and it takes advantage of the fact that every animal sheds DNA into its environment via skin, hair, scales, feces or bodily fluids as it moves through the world.
As wildlife biologists at the University of Florida’s Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience & Sea Turtle Hospital, we use eDNA to track a virus responsible for a sea turtle pandemic called fibropapillomatosis, which causes debilitating tumors. We also use eDNA to detect sea turtles in the wild.
But in 2020, human health researchers began repurposing eDNA techniques to track the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a prime example of how research in one area – wildlife conservation – can be adapted to another area – human disease mitigation. Going forward, we believe eDNA will prove to be an essential tool for monitoring both human and animal health.
Scientists in the 1980s began hunting for microbe DNA in soil samples. Over the next 20 years, the technique was adapted for use with air and water samples, and scientists started using eDNA to detect larger animals and plants.
While the science behind eDNA techniques is complex, the actual process of collecting and testing a sample is relatively simple. Samples are filtered through very fine paper, which traps loose cells and strands of DNA. The techniques to read what DNA is present are the same as those used for tissue or blood samples, usually quantitative polymerase chain reaction or whole genome sequencing. Scientists can either read all of the DNA present from every organism – or target just the DNA from species of interest.
Scientists now routinely use eDNA to detect endangered wildlife and invasive species. The ability to tell whether an animal is present without ever needing to lay eyes or a lens on it is an incredible leap forward, decreasing the time, resources and human effort needed to monitor and protect vulnerable species.
However, to truly protect endangered species, it’s not just the animals that need to be monitored, but the pathogens that threaten their survival. Environmental DNA is able to monitor the parasites, fungi, and viruses that can cause disease in wildlife.
While scientists originally applied eDNA to human pathogen detection over a decade ago, it wasn’t until the beginning of the current COVID-19 human pandemic that the repurposing of eDNA took off on a large scale, allowing the technology to make staggering advancements in very short order.
Coronavirus genomes consist not of DNA, but rather its cousin molecule, RNA. So researchers have rapidly optimized a variation of eDNA – eRNA – to detect coronavirus RNA in air and human wastewater.
For example, at the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital, researchers collected air samples from the hospital room of two COVID-19 patients. Using eRNA, they successfully isolated and sequenced the virus. Confirming air as a key route of transmission directly influenced public health guidelines.
When scientists apply eRNA to archived wastewater samples, the true dates of SARS-CoV-2 appearance can be detected. SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater in Valencia, Spain, peaked on March 9, 2020, but the number of clinical cases didn’t peak until the start of April 2020 because of the lag time between infection and severe clinical symptoms.
This sort of predictive monitoring has profound implications for health care systems, allowing time to prepare – not just for COVID-19, but for any future disease outbreaks that threaten human populations.

It’s vital that human and animal diseases are studied together. Sixty percent of emerging human pathogens come from animals – with many of these (42%) originating in wildlife populations, including Ebola, Zika, West Nile and Marburg viruses. Alternatively, people can also transmit pathogens to animals.
SARS-CoV-2 has already infected apes at a zoo in San Diego, large cats at a zoo in New York and minks at farms in Europe – the latter of which gave rise to new variants that could prove a new threat to people.
Medics, veterinarians and scientists call this convergence of human, animal, and environmental well-being OneHealth or EcoHealth. Studying and treating human and wildlife disease together recognizes their commonalities and often yields breakthroughs.
With eDNA, all pathogens can be monitored in an environment regardless of where they come from. An integrated eDNA monitoring program could cost-effectively provide advanced warning of human, livestock and wildlife diseases. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

An infection of the new coronavirus in such newborns is associated with a three-fold risk of severe medical complications, according to a study conducted by scientists at the University of Oxford.
While pregnant women are at higher risk of complications such as premature birth, high blood pressure with organ failure risk, need for intensive care and possible death.
“Women with COVID-19 during pregnancy were over 50% more likely to experience pregnancy complications compared to pregnant women unaffected by COVID-19,” said Aris Papageorghiou, co-lead of the trial and a professor of fetal medicine at Oxford University.
The study was conducted in more than 2,100 pregnant women across 18 countries, where each woman affected by COVID-19 was compared to two non-infected women giving birth at the same time in the same hospital.
Findings from the study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, also showed a delivery by caesarean section may be associated with an increased risk of virus infection in newborns.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/navalny-hunger-strike-how-long-humans-survive-without-food/,Navalny has been on hunger strike for over 3 weeks. How long can humans survive without food?,"From time to time, generally when there’s a public case of a hunger strike, people ask me how long a person can survive without food.
The hunger strike generating attention at the moment is that of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Navalny, who was arrested in January after returning to Russia, began refusing food on March 31 in protest at not being able to access medical care in prison. This means he’s been fasting now for more than three weeks.
Based on the science of long-term fasting, Navalny could theoretically continue his hunger strike for another number of weeks. But reports suggest he’s experiencing problems with his kidneys, which may be caused by underlying health issues. He’s now in a prison hospital, with concerns circulating he is very ill.
To put the specifics of Navalny’s situation aside, a normal adult human can actually survive a surprisingly long time without food, provided they have an adequate intake of water, which contains some minerals.
I advise my undergraduate students to avoid hunger strikes to generate public pressure, because generally it takes too long for health risks to become severe enough to garner the expected attention.
Evolution has prepared us well to starve. It’s conceivable early hunter-gatherers and early farmers endured extended periods without adequate food. We’re also aware of pictures of prisoners of war with a skeletal appearance who were undernourished for months, if not years.
The science is pretty well understood, thanks to a pioneer in this field, George F. Cahill, and his colleagues. In the 1960s Cahill worked with volunteers in fasting experiments of up to 40 days, and established many of the ways our bodies seem to adapt to long periods without food.
The main challenge to long-term fasting is our brain. It consumes 20% of our total energy, regardless of mental activity. It also loves glucose, our preferred energy provider when we’re eating normally.
The body’s stores of glucose are fairly limited and run out in less than one day when we stop eating. But your body knows what to do. While you’re sleeping or fasting, your body starts to convert muscle mass into glucose, thereby keeping glucose levels up.
Producing glucose from muscle protein is a good way to keep up glucose in the short term, but you don’t want to lose muscle mass in case you need to be active again.
Enter fat. Fat is our best energy store. In contrast to glycogen (our stores of glucose in the body), fat doesn’t need water to be stored with it, meaning it gives you far more energy for an equivalent amount. Per gram, fat has more than twice the energy content of carbohydrates and protein.
Even a person at a normal weight has about 15kg of fat and 6kg of protein in the form of muscle. Almost all the fat is dispensable, but only part of the muscles can be wasted to avoid damage to vital organs.
So fat stores are mobilized during fasting to sustain the body. But they provide limited capacity to generate glucose. To keep your brain happy, your body has two tricks up its sleeve. First, fat is converted into ketone bodies — an alternative energy supply to glucose — through a process called ketogenesis.
You can push your body to make ketone bodies by eating a lot of fat and minimal glucose (think ketogenic diets), or by starving. The levels of ketone bodies in blood rise after a couple of hours of fasting, and skyrocket over the next couple of days of fasting. Importantly, your organs prefer them over glucose to generate energy.
The second trick is that your brain starts using ketone bodies as an energy source as well. This is an important trick to minimize the loss of muscle mass, by reducing the demand for glucose. The brain works very well on ketone bodies and there’s no reduction of intellectual capacity.
In summary, the body has some nifty ways of using muscle mass and fat to produce the energy we need, when it’s not coming directly from glucose. And we can usually survive until these alternate supplies are depleted.
A normal person might last for almost three months without eating if resting; two months is considered a safe bet.
An obese person could take much longer to starve, perhaps 6-12 months, because of the considerably larger fat mass their body can draw on for energy supplies. However, loss of muscle mass could impair mobility, and heart and kidney function.
For a person on a hunger strike, the feeling of hunger first increases but then subsides. In response to starvation and malnutrition, a person is likely to experience chronic fatigue, and a range of negative effects on their mood.
However, not drinking any water is much more dangerous than abstaining from food. It will cause serious health problems and death a lot more quickly.",Stefan Broer,"Apr 23, 2021 10:42 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/eu-regulator-finds-possible-link-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-blood-clots/,"EU regulator backs J&J shot, finds possible link to clots","Europe’s drug regulator has found a possible link between Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine and rare blood clotting issues in adults who received doses in the United States, but backed its overall benefits against any risks.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Tuesday, April 20, its safety committee had concluded that a warning about unusual blood clots with low platelets must be added to the vaccine’s labels, just as it has also required of rival vaccine maker AstraZeneca.
The review of the cases prompted a pause in the rollout of the vaccine in Europe and the United States last week, the latest blow to efforts to tackle the pandemic, which has killed more than 3.1 million and infected 142.1 million worldwide.
While the regulator said it considers the vaccine safe, it was up to the EU member states to decide how to use it, taking a similar stance to that with AstraZeneca.
“I have to stress again (the cases) are very rare and in the vast majority of cases these vaccines are going to prevent death and hospitalization from COVID-19,” EMA executive director Emer Cooke said in a briefing.
“We have to balance the benefits of the vaccine with the risks.”
Several nations have suspended or limited the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine over possible blood clots.
The EMA examined eight cases of clotting that occurred in US adults under 60 years, mostly women, within three weeks of vaccination with J&J’s single shot.
If treated early, health care professionals can help people in their recovery and avoid further complications, Sabine Straus, chair of EMA’s safety committee, told the briefing.
With both the AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines, the reports involve extremely rare clotting, mainly a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), which was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets, called thrombocytopenia.
J&J has said it is working closely with regulators and noted that no clear causal relationship had been established between the clotting cases and its shot.
The EU watchdog also said that most clots had occurred in the brain and abdomen, as was the case with AstraZeneca’s shot, Vaxzevria, which is also being studied for similar blood clotting problems.
“One plausible explanation for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in patients treated with heparin,” the EMA said.
The US health regulator last week recommended pausing the use of the J&J single-dose shot after six women under the age of 50 developed blood clots after receiving it.
The cases were reported out of more than 7 million doses administered in the United States as of April 13, the EMA said.
US authorities will meet on Friday, April 23, to discuss whether to resume using the vaccine.
J&J, which recorded $100 million in COVID-19 vaccine sales, has delayed rolling out the vaccine to Europe, but said on Tuesday it was prepared to resume the deployment. It has said it would aim to deliver 55 million doses to the EU, as contracted, by the end of June.

The new effectiveness rate is higher than the 91.6% rate outlined in results from a large-scale trial of Sputnik V that was published in The Lancet medical journal earlier this year, and compares favorably with data on the effectiveness of other COVID-19 vaccines.
The new data was based on 3.8 million Russians who received both a first shot and a booster shot as part of the national roll-out of Sputnik V.
“This data confirms that Sputnik V demonstrates one of the best protection rates against coronavirus among all vaccines,” said Kirill Dmitriev, head of the RDIF sovereign wealth fund which is backing the vaccine.
The incidence of infection was calculated from the 35th day from the first injection, the statement said, showing an incidence rate of 0.027%.
The incidence of infection among unvaccinated adults during a considerable period following the launch of mass vaccination in Russia was 1.1%, it said, without specifying the date range used.
The new data will be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal next month, the statement added.
The data was collated from a database kept by the health ministry that registers vaccinated people, as well as a separate database of people who were infected with COVID-19 in the country, the statement said.",Reuters,"Apr 20, 2021 9:29 AM PHT"

The vaccine was 85% effective in preventing hospitalizations and 80% effective in preventing deaths, the government said in a report prepared by the Chilean health ministry.
The release of the data makes Chile one of a handful of countries, including the United Kingdom and Israel, that have used inoculation campaigns to gather insights into how effective vaccines are outside controlled clinical trials and when faced with unpredictable variables in societies.
Israel’s real-world study of the effectiveness of Pfizer’s vaccine looked at the results among 1.2 million people, a mix of those who received the shot and those who did not.
Chile’s study examined CoronaVac’s effectiveness among 10.5 million people, again looking both at people who had been vaccinated and those who had not. Vaccines were administered in Chile approximately 28 days apart.
The data compares favorably to previous data released on CoronaVac’s efficacy in clinical trials.
In January, a Brazilian trial said general efficacy of the drug in preventing symptomatic infection was 50.4%. A later study, published this month, said efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 was 50.7%, efficacy against cases requiring medical treatment was 83.7%, and efficacy against moderate and severe cases was 100%.
Indonesia gave the vaccine emergency-use approval based on interim data showing it was 65% effective.
In a Turkish trial, CoronaVac had an efficacy in preventing symptomatic infection of 83.5%, and 100% in preventing severe illness and hospitalization.
The Chilean study looked at the impact of the vaccination among people in the public health system between February 2 and April 1, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, income level and nationality.
Its authors stressed that its results, for example a lower protection against death than in clinical trials, should be considered against the backdrop of a fierce second wave of the pandemic.
It compared people who were not inoculated, individuals 14 days or more after receiving one dose and more than 14 days after receiving a second dose.
Partially vaccinated people, those with just one shot, were found to be far more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19, the results showed.",Reuters,"Apr 16, 2021 11:27 PM PHT"

“Cases and deaths are continuing to increase at worrying rates,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a briefing focused on Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the western Pacific region.
He said he was very worried about the potential for a much larger epidemic in PNG, and it was vital the country received more COVID-19 vaccines as soon as possible.
PNG has now reported more than 9,300 COVID-19 cases and 82 deaths. “While these numbers are still smaller than other countries, the increase is sharp and WHO is very concerned about the potential for a much larger epidemic,” Tedros said.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/iranian-islamic-medicine-coda-story/,The rise of pseudoscientific Islamic cures in Iran,"In late January 2020, the Iranian cleric Abbas Tabrizian publicly set fire to a copy of “Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine,” a foundational text for doctors around the world. It was a dramatic gesture to his hostility to modern medicine.
The following month, when COVID-19 began to ravage his home city of Qom, he had an immediate alternative remedy. “Before going to sleep, put a cotton ball soaked in violet oil into your anus,” he told his 200,000 Telegram followers. A year on, he made international headlines by declaring that coronavirus vaccines would “make people gay.”
Tabrizian is often referred to as the “father of Islamic medicine” by his followers and is known for pushing unproven remedies to believers, with no regard for scientific consensus. Thousands of shops in Iran sell herbal treatments. This has increased since the imposition of U.S. sanctions in 2012, and the country’s internet is full of start-ups advertising “Islamic” oils and potions for every kind of ailment, backed by religious influencers like Tabrizian.
Mehdi Sabili, an “Islamic medicine specialist” with over 60,000 followers on Instagram, runs one such company. In April, he urged Iranians to sip hot camel urine to ward off the virus. Another even more popular figure, with 185,000 followers, is Dr. Hossein Ravazadeh, a conspiracy theorist and promoter of Islamic medicine who considers much of modern medicine to be a “colonial conspiracy” dreamed up by Zionists and the British. His remedy for the virus is simpler than Sabili’s: drop bitter watermelon oil into your ears, morning and night, and “all obnoxious creatures” will be unable to enter the body, including COVID-19.
Rather than being fringe figures, Ravazadeh, Sabili, Tabrizian and others like them are prominent and powerful anti-science voices in Iran. They regularly appear on state TV stations, and draw the support of members of parliament and religious authorities.
“These people aren’t necessarily popular among the middle class or educated people, but they are being supported, they are being funded, and they have followers who believe what they’re saying and do whatever they say. It’s obviously harmful,” said Farhad Souzanchi, editor of the Farsi-language fact-checking site Fact Nameh.
The Islamic alternative medicine industry creates a new class of religious “experts” within Iran, who claim miraculous results by prescribing unscientific treatments. The ideology they promote is upheld by some within religious factions of the regime.
Iran has a history of traditional medicine that stretches back thousands of years. Some traditional remedies have been shown to be effective. For instance, modern clinical research suggests that saffron, a highly prized spice, may have mood-boosting properties that could be effective in helping people with mild to moderate depression.
In Iran, experts make a distinction between legitimate research into time-honored practices and the endorsement of pseudoscience that relies upon interpretations of Islamic scripture, obsolete medical theories, and the whims of contemporary religious figures.
In recent decades, the revival of traditional Iranian medicine has been a top priority for the government, which has provided funding for universities to research age-old treatments. “The interest is political,” said Kiarash Aramesh, Director of the Bioethics Institute at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania. He explained that promoting Iranian traditional medicine will in turn “promote Iranian identity and the notion of self-reliance.”
Traditional remedies are a source of national pride in many countries. In China, Xi Jinping is leading a similar drive to leverage traditional Chinese medicine to his advantage, believing it to be an effective soft power tool for the Communist party. Beijing is now proposing a ban on all criticism of such treatments, in order to stop scientists questioning their legitimacy.
Homayoun Kheyri, an Iranian-Australian biologist and journalist based in London,  believes there is a big difference between the use of complementary herbal remedies for common complaints, and religious figures advocating that unproven treatments be used as replacements for science-backed medicines during a pandemic.
“You grow up with these kinds of traditions and you believe they work,” he said. “But you can’t sell it by ideology, whether Islamic or communist, or imperialist, or whatever.”
Still, scientists in Iran can be hesitant to push back against the clerical endorsement of such treatments. “It’s very dangerous to question Islamic texts — it’s risky. But whenever they get the chance, the scientific community object,” said Souzanchi.
Last year, three doctors were reportedly sentenced to 60 lashes each after they criticized Tabrizian’s burning of the medical manual. But there was also disagreement among clerics: Grand Ayatollah Ja’far Sobhani stated that “insulting medical learning is against the spirit of Islam.”
Iran has experienced a steady rejection of established science during the pandemic. In January, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned the importation of vaccines from the U.S. and U.K., branding them “untrustworthy” and saying that it was “not unlikely they would want to contaminate other nations.”
The Iranian regime maycondone public advocacy of unproven treatments because it has few alternatives. Crippling sanctions mean that the country has struggled for years to get hold of essential medicines. During the coronavirus crisis, human rights groups said those same measures have impeded its ability to import medical equipment and vaccines.
As a result, Iran’s black market for medical supplies is flourishing, and religious figures have been busily promoting alternative COVID-19 treatments. In March 2020, one cleric visited a ward full of coronavirus patients in northern Iran, swabbing what he called “perfume of the Prophet” beneath their noses. Even fewer resources are needed for the practice of so-called “energy healing,” which relies on “the invigorating power” of healing hands.
“Iran is in a corner with no access to anything,” said Kheyri, the bioiogist in London. “If someone can say, ‘OK, well, we can provide energy without any medicine’ – people will try it.”
In June 2020, Iran’s ministry of health announced that all students in medicine, dentistry and pharmacology should take Islamic or traditional medicine modules. 26 Iranian MPs have also presented a plan to create an official “Islamic-Iranian medicine organization,” overseen by the health ministry, that would give licenses to sellers prescribing alternative remedies. Last week, the head of Iran’s medical council, the country’s main doctors association, said that such plans were “playing with the nation’s reputation,” and would “undoubtedly cause disillusionment towards both Islam and Iran in scientific and international forums.”",Isobel Cockerell,"Apr 15, 2021 4:22 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/sweden-faces-sperm-deficit-as-pandemic-keeps-donors-away-from-clinics/,Sweden faces sperm deficit as pandemic keeps donors away from clinics,"Sweden is facing an acute shortage of sperm for assisted pregnancy as would-be donors avoid hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic, halting inseminations in large parts of the healthcare system and driving up waiting times by years.
“We’re running out of sperm. We’ve never had so few donors as during the last year,” said Ann Thurin Kjellberg, head of the reproduction unit at Gothenburg’s University Hospital.
The shortage has meant waiting times for assisted pregnancy have shot up from around 6 months to an estimated 30 months in the past year, possibly longer, doctors familiar with the matter told Reuters.
“It’s stressful that we can’t get a clear time or date for treatment,” said Elin Bergsten, a 28-year-old math teacher from southern Sweden.
Two years ago, Bergsten and her husband learned he was unable to produce semen, and the pair immediately applied for assisted pregnancy. She was due to have her second cycle of insemination before her treatment was indefinitely delayed due to the shortage.
“It’s a national phenomenon,” Thurin Kjellberg said. “We’ve run out in Gothenburg and Malmo, they will soon run out in Stockholm,” she added, naming the 3 most populous areas of the country.
Beyond public healthcare providers, there are also private clinics in Sweden which are able to circumvent shortages by buying sperm from abroad.
But assisted pregnancy treatment there often costs as much as 100,000 Swedish crowns ($11,785), making it unaffordable for many. Assisted pregnancy is free within Sweden’s national health service.
The Nordic countries and Belgium have the highest assisted conception rates in the world, in terms of availability of cycles per million of population, according to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.
Under Swedish law, a sperm sample can only be used by a maximum of 6 women. Most donated sperm in Sweden has reached this legal capacity, meaning that in many areas, assisted pregnancy is only available for women who have used a specific sperm sample before.
Margareta Kitlinski, who runs the reproduction unit at Skane University Hospital, the largest such clinic in Sweden, said it takes around 8 months to process a donor due to the many tests involved, and that many samples fail to become viable donations due to common problems in freezing.
“If you have 50 men contact you, at best only half of them could be donors,” Kitlinski said.
Some Swedish regions have taken to social media to encourage potential male donors, but with varying results. In the meantime, the shortage lingers.
“We need to go on TV and tell Swedish men to come forward,” Thurin Kjellberg said.",Reuters,"Apr 15, 2021 3:56 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/united-kingdom-trial-switching-covid-19-vaccines-adds-moderna-novavax-shots/,"UK trial on switching COVID-19 vaccines adds Moderna, Novavax shots","A UK study into using different COVID-19 vaccines in two-dose inoculations is being expanded to include shots made by Moderna and Novavax, researchers said on Wednesday, April 14.
The trial, known as the Com-Cov study, was first launched in February to look at whether giving a first dose of one type of COVID-19 shot, and a second dose of another, elicits an immune response that is as good as using two doses of the same vaccine.
The idea, said Matthew Snape, the Oxford University professor leading the trial, “is to explore whether the multiple COVID-19 vaccines that are available can be used more flexibly”.
Britain and many other countries in Europe are currently using AstraZeneca’s and Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines in nationwide immunization campaigns against the coronavirus pandemic.
But reports of very rare blood clots have prompted some governments –including France and Germany – to say the AstraZeneca shot should only be given to certain age groups, or that people who have had a first dose of AstraZeneca’s vaccine should switch to a different one for their second dose.
In a briefing about the expansion of the study to include Moderna’s and Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccines, Snape, an associate professor in pediatrics and vaccinology at Oxford, said it will seek to recruit adults aged over 50 who have received their first, or “prime” vaccination in the past 8-12 weeks.
These volunteers, who will have received either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine, will be randomly allocated to get either the same vaccine, or the Moderna or Novavax vaccine, for a second dose.
The 6 new arms of the trial will each involve 175 people, adding a further 1,050 recruits in total, Snape said.
“If we can show that these mixed schedules generate an immune response that is as good as the standard schedules, and without a significant increase in the vaccine reactions, this will potentially allow more people to complete their COVID-19 immunization course more rapidly,” Snape said.
“This would also create resilience within the system in the event of a shortfall in availability of any of the vaccines.”

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/novavax-supply-shortages-delaying-full-speed-production-covid-19-vaccine/,Novavax says supply shortages delaying full-speed production of its COVID-19 vaccine,"Novavax Inc has pushed back the timeline for hitting its production target of 150 million COVID-19 vaccine doses per month until the third quarter due to supply shortages including bags used to grow cells, a company spokeswoman told Reuters.
Novavax executives had previously said full-scale vaccine production could be achieved by mid-year. The company told Reuters in January it expected to reach full production capacity by May or June.
“We said during our earnings call that we expect all capacity being online by around mid-year. We’re continuing to refine that timing as we get closer, which now leads us to think we’re online/at full capacity by Q3,” Novavax communications director Amy Speak said by email on Monday.
“There are some supply shortages that come and go that have contributed to the revision in timing,” she added. “These have included things like the bioreactor bags and filters.”
Novavax could receive UK regulatory authorization for its vaccine as early as this month after releasing impressive UK trial data. It anticipates clearance in the United States could come as early as May after soon-to-be released data from its US vaccine trial are reviewed by regulators.
The Maryland-based company is one of several COVID-19 vaccine makers that have had to push back production timelines due to industrywide shortages of raw materials and difficulties getting plants up and running.
Reuters reported last month that Novavax had delayed a planned deal to ship at least 100 million doses of its two-shot vaccine to the European Union, in part because of supply challenges.
In a Saturday interview with the Guardian, Novavax Chief Executive Stan Erck said the company has faced difficulties sourcing key production materials including single-use bags used to grow vaccine cells.
“Single-use bags are facing critical shortages and delays,” said Mark Womack, chief business officer of AGC Biologics, a contract manufacturer that is producing materials used in Novavax’s vaccine.
Data released in March from the UK trial showed the vaccine to be highly effective against the original strain of the novel coronavirus as well as the more contagious and deadly variant first discovered in Britain and now rampant in Europe and the United States. The data also suggests the shot provides some protection against a highly concerning variant that emerged in South Africa, which some drugmakers have said may require a booster shot to address.",Reuters,"Apr 14, 2021 11:01 AM PHT"

“I think that the AstraZeneca vaccine from a standpoint of efficacy is a good vaccine, and if the safety issue gets straightened out in the European Union … the efficacy of that vaccine is really quite good,” he told BBC radio on Tuesday, April 13.
“Whether or not we ever use AZ is unclear but it looks right now at this point in time that we will not need it. It’s not a negative indictment of AZ, it is just possible that given the supply that we have from other companies that we may not need to use an AZ vaccine.”
As the United States loosens its COVID-19 restrictions, Fauci also said there was a “really risky situation” when bars and restaurants were reopening in some places where the use of masks was not being enforced.
He said the vaccine rollout would blunt “a real explosion of a surge” but it would not stop a moderate increase in cases.
“This is not a time to prematurely declare victory because we have such a successful rollout,” he said.
The AstraZeneca vaccine is being investigated by European regulators over concerns about rare cases of blood clots. It has not yet been approved in the United States.
European regulators have found possible links between the shot, which has been given to tens of millions of people, and blood clots but they have reaffirmed the vaccine’s importance in protecting people against COVID-19.
More than a dozen countries have at one time suspended use of the vaccine, but most have resumed, with some, including France, the Netherlands and Germany, recommending a minimum age.
Officials in Britain, where the vaccine was first approved, have advised that those aged under 30 should be offered an alternative.

The strain, known as B117, was identified in Britain late last year and has become the most common strain in the United States, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The study analyzed a group of 496 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to British hospitals in November and December last year, comparing outcomes in patients infected with B117 or other variants. The researchers found no difference in risks of severe disease, death, or other clinical outcomes in patients with B117 and other variants.
“Our data, within the context and limitations of a real-world study, provide initial reassurance that severity in hospitalized patients with B117 is not markedly different from severity in those without,” the researchers said in the study.
A separate study published in The Lancet Public Health medical journal found that vaccines were likely to be effective against the British variant since there was no apparent increase in reinfection rate when compared to non-UK variants.
According to British scientists, the British variant was about 40%-70% more transmissible than previously dominant variants.

So far some 780 million vaccines have been administered globally, but measures including wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing must be applied to reverse the trajectory.
“We too want to see societies and economies reopening, and travel and trade resuming,” Tedros told a news briefing.
“But right now, intensive care units in many countries are overflowing and people are dying – and it’s totally avoidable.”
“The COVID-19 pandemic is a long way from over. But we have many reasons for optimism. The decline in cases and deaths during the first two months of the year shows that this virus and its variants can be stopped,” he added.
Transmission was being driven by “confusion, complacency, and inconsistency in public health measures.”
India has overtaken Brazil to become the nation with the second highest number of infections worldwide after the United States, as it battles a massive second wave, having given about 105 million vaccine doses among a population of 1.4 billion.

Noting that there had been a 9% rise in cases last week, the seventh consecutive week of increases, and a 5% rise in deaths, she added: “If you look at the epi (epidemic) curve and the trajectory of the pandemic right now, it is growing exponentially.”
Tedros said that in some countries, despite continuing transmission, restaurants and nightclubs were full and markets were open and crowded with few people taking precautions.

Available data shows Chinese vaccines lag behind others including Pfizer and Moderna in terms of efficacy, but require less stringent temperature controls during storage.
The currently available vaccines “don’t have very high rates of protection” Gao Fu, the director of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a conference in the Chinese city of Chengdu on Saturday.
“Inoculation using vaccines of different technical lines is being considered,” he said.
Gao said that taking steps to “optimize” the vaccine process including changing the number of doses and the length of time between doses was a “definite” solution to the efficacy issues.
China has developed 4 domestic vaccines approved for public use and an official said on Saturday that the county will likely produce 3 billion doses by the end of the year.

A follow-up study of 33 people who received Moderna Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine in early trials show the antibodies it induced are still present 6 months after the second dose. “Antibody activity remained high in all age groups,” researchers said. They confirmed the findings using 3 different tests, according to a report on Tuesday, April 6, in The New England Journal of Medicine. Earlier this month, Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE said their vaccine using similar messenger RNA (mRNA) technology remained highly effective for at least 6 months. The researchers conducting the Moderna vaccine study will continue to follow the same volunteers to see whether the antibodies last longer than 6 months. They are also evaluating the potential for a booster dose to extend the duration of the antibodies and improve their potency against new more contagious variants of the coronavirus.
Surgeons worldwide have been performing lung transplants in COVID-19 survivors with irreversible lung damage, and an international group of transplant experts has proposed guidelines for selection of eligible patients. To possibly qualify for a transplant, COVID-19 survivors with complete lung failure should be younger than 65, nonsmokers, and have no pre-existing medical conditions, or only manageable ones, they advise. They said transplants should be performed at least 4 weeks after a diagnosis of irreversible lung damage. In the United States alone, more than 50 double lung transplants have been performed on COVID-19 survivors, and all the patients are alive, said Dr. Ankit Bharat of Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, who has performed a dozen of them. A study published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine that examined 12 of the first double-lung transplants performed in COVID-19 patients in the United States, Italy, Austria, and India showed that all but two survived and are doing well, said co-author Bharat. “It’s a really remarkable outcome, given how critically ill these patients were,” he said. “Without the possibility of transplant, the medical team and the families were ready to withdraw care.”
The mRNA COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech is safe for patients being treated with cancer immunotherapies like Merck & Co’s Keytruda and Opdivo sold by Bristol Myers Squibb, Israeli physicians said in a report published in The Lancet Oncology. They studied 134 vaccine recipients who were being treated with the so-called immune-checkpoint inhibitors, including some who were also receiving chemotherapy. The vaccine was “safe from both sides: we did not see immunotherapy-related side effects and did not see severe side effects from the vaccine itself,” said the report’s co-author Dr. Ido Wolf of the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. “We believe that the vaccine should be given to these patients … especially in areas of an active COVID-19 outbreak.” However, questions still need to be answered for these patients, including whether there are any long-term issues. “We looked at our patients only a few weeks from the second dose and cannot rule out the possibility of long-term side effects,” Wolf said. His team is also looking into whether other cancer drugs, such as chemotherapies, may reduce the efficacy of the vaccine.
A wide range of skin reactions has been documented in recipients of the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, but none have been serious, according to researchers who analyzed 414 cases in a registry run by dermatology societies. The majority (83%) were associated with the Moderna shot. Most started the day after, or often several days to a week, after vaccination, said Dr. Esther Freeman of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who coauthored a report published on Wednesday in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. Fewer than half of patients who experienced a delayed skin reaction after the first dose experienced a recurrence with the second dose. Furthermore, no patients in the registry developed serious adverse events after the first or second dose. “If the patient develops a delayed-onset rash more than four hours after vaccination, while the rash may be uncomfortable, our data suggest they … should feel comfortable proceeding with the second dose of their vaccine,” Freeman said. However, she added, hives that start within 4 hours after vaccination “should be taken very seriously,” as that may be a sign of an immediate allergic reaction.

More than 700 million jabs have been administered worldwide against the disease, but 87% have gone to high income or upper middle-income countries, with low income countries receiving just 0.2%, he said.
“On average in high-income countries, almost one in four people has received a COVID-19 vaccine. In low-income countries, it’s one in more than 500,” Tedros told a briefing.
The COVAX facility has delivered nearly 38.4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to 102 countries across 6 continents, 6 weeks after it began to roll out supplies, the GAVI vaccine alliance and WHO said on Thursday. It aims to deliver more than 2 billion doses this year but has faced delays.
“We hope to be able to catch up during April and May. The problem is not getting vaccines out of COVAX, the problem is getting them in,” Tedros said, decrying the scarcity of supply.
The AstraZeneca shot – the mainstay of the COVAX program so far – has been hit by safety concerns after reports of blood clots in some recipients.
Australia said on Friday it had ordered more alternatives for the AstraZeneca vaccine, setting back its vaccination rollout, and Hong Kong delayed deliveries of the shot amid concern about a possible very small risk of rare blood clots.
GAVI CEO Seth Berkley, asked whether COVAX was negotiating for more doses of the vaccine being shunned by some countries, said that the Anglo-Swedish company’s supply chain had “picked up.”
He hoped that the supply of AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India – whose doses are now being kept domestically for use against an accelerating epidemic – would improve over time.
“As countries decide they are going to prioritize one vaccine or another that may free up doses, and in doing we will try to make sure those doses are made available without delay, if countries are willing to make that happen,” Berkely said.",Reuters,"Apr 10, 2021 9:37 AM PHT"

The European Medicines Agency’s safety committee has also been looking at how AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine is associated with very rare cases of unusual blood clots and said it was now reviewing reports of capillary leak syndrome in people given AstraZeneca’s vaccine.
Johnson & Johnson (J&J) said it was aware of the rare reports of blood clots in individuals given its COVID-19 vaccine, and was working with regulators to assess the data and provide relevant information.
“At present, no clear causal relationship has been established between these rare events and the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine,” the company said in an emailed statement.
Of the 4 serious cases of clotting and low platelets, 3 occurred in the United States during the rollout of J&J’s vaccine from its Janssen unit, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said. That was in addition to one person who died from a clotting disorder reported in J&J’s clinical trial.
The US Food and Drug Administration said it is aware of a few reports of individuals who had serious blood clots – sometimes linked with low levels of blood platelets – after they received the J&J vaccine, and noted that these conditions can have many different causes.
“We have not found a causal relationship with vaccination and we are continuing our investigation and assessment of these cases. Our analysis of the data will inform the potential need for regulatory action,” the agency said in an emailed statement.
Nearly 5 million people in the United States had received J&J’s vaccine as of Thursday morning, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The report from the EMA is the first to mention a probe of blood clots associated with the J&J vaccine. The FDA said it was aware of the EMA’s statement and provided the agency with the data that formed the basis of its report.
The EMA’s statement follows an investigation of blood clots in the brain reported by some people given the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has prompted some European countries to change their vaccine recommendations.
In its report on Friday, EMA’s safety committee said unusual blood clots linked with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
It has also started to investigate reports of capillary leak syndrome – which causes blood vessel swelling and a drop in blood pressure – in 5 people who received the AstraZeneca vaccine. The safety panel said it was not clear whether these were linked with the vaccine. AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ian Douglas, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the reports were part of a normal process in which the EMA’s safety committee reviews important safety signals as they arise.
“It’s too early to comment on the signal of capillary leak with the AZ vaccine, or clots with the Janssen vaccine, but from what we’ve seen in the last few weeks, the EMA’s PRAC (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee) will doubtless assess all the evidence they have as thoroughly and quickly as possible,” he said.
Some countries in Europe and Asia have restricted the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, Vaxzevria, in younger people following an update by EU and UK regulators this week that found a link between the events and the shot. Regulators have said the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.
Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infectious disease expert at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. and a former chief scientist for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said in a briefing on Thursday that he was “fairly convinced” the brain blood clots were linked with the AstraZeneca vaccine, but said the events are rare and the risk during an active outbreak from COVID “is much higher.”
J&J’s single-dose vaccine has been approved for EU use, but a rollout is yet to begin. It is mainly being used in the United States currently.

Now 39 years old, she was an anxious child and struggled with bulimia as a teenager. In her twenties, she began to work as a school counselor and had reached a good place, where she was comfortable with her body and self-image.
In 2010, three years after giving birth to her first child, she took up CrossFit, a globally popular exercise regimen that also promoted the paleo diet, modeled on what hunter-gatherers are supposed to have eaten thousands of years ago. Based on lean meats, fish, fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds, it restricts a wide range of modern-day staples.
At first, Bloomberg, who lives in Los Angeles, did not follow the diet, mindful of her history of eating disorders. Others in her CrossFit community respected her decision, but she became curious and began reading books and listening to podcasts about the plan.
“I was like I’m in,” she said. “They all talked about how the cause of diseases like cancer or mental health issues, or anything was because of eating grains and dairy, and I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, the cause of everything terrible is all these toxins in food.’”
Bloomberg wasn’t just worried about herself. Soon, she began to believe that her three-year-old daughter should eat paleo.
“That caused me so much stress. She was in preschool at the time and they’d serve crackers at lunch or snack, and she’d go to parties and it felt like she was going to die — ‘These things are going to cause cancer, they’re serving pizza and cake,’” she said. “I didn’t want her, or me, to become anorexic and have an eating disorder, but it also seemed like a real danger to be eating these foods.”
Bloomberg abandoned clean eating in 2019. Looking back, she believes that she suffered from orthorexia nervosa, a proposed disorder characterized by an obsession with only consuming clean and pure food.
Orthorexia was named in 1997 by the U.S. alternative medicine practitioner Dr. Steven Bratman. He described it as when “thinking about healthy food can become the central theme of almost every moment of the day, the sword and shield against every kind of anxiety, and the primary source of self-esteem, value and meaning.”
Promoting “clean” ways of eating has long been a core part of wellness and diet culture. But, while a diet rich in fresh fruit and vegetables and low in processed foods is undoubtedly good for us, the merits of completely removing whole food groups, such as grains and dairy, are at best debatable.
Along with a variety of other dubious trends, such as juice cleanses and unnecessary intermittent fasting, the clean eating movement has exploded on social media feeds in recent years. Impeccably curated feeds provide recipes and extol the purported health benefits of radically altering your diet, excluding many foods and only consuming whole, natural products. But, as colorful and wholesome as those images look, experts believe that fixating on the perceived purity of what we eat can be seriously detrimental to our physical and mental health.
While orthorexia is not an official diagnosis in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, health experts are witnessing a growing fixation with food purity and some have come to see “clean eating” as a possible trigger for unhealthy relationships with food.
“Once it starts contributing to distress for the individual, with feelings of shame and guilt, and starts to really interfere with their lives, that’s when we start to think it’s starting to look more like a disorder rather than somebody making minor modifications to their diet,” Suman Ambwani, an associate professor of psychology at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, told me.
In the course of her research on clean eating trends in the U.S., Ambwani has found that the vast majority of young adherents consider such dietary plans to be healthy and that most of them first become aware of them via social media. A 2017 study published in the peer-reviewed journal Eating and Weight Disorders also linked Instagram to symptoms of orthorexia.
Aside from a lack of formal diagnostic criteria, identifying orthorexia is tricky because — unlike other established eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia, which are based on calorie-counting and the quantity of food eaten — it is said to hinge solely around the quality and purity of a person’s diet.
“We want people to make sure that they have a balanced diet and that they’re being thoughtful about what they’re eating. But, just as you can get carried away with not being fat, you can get carried away with healthy eating,” said Thom Dunn, a professor at School of psychological science at University of Northern Colorado.
Experts contend that even when they contain enough calories, highly restrictive diets can result in digestion problems, malnutrition, deficiencies or hormonal balances. They can also have a profound effect on people’s lives.
“It sometimes has consequences with your friends or family because you can’t participate in certain events because the wrong foods are going to be served, or you have to spend an hour fixing your lunch because it’s got to be perfectly or meticulously prepared,” Dunn explained. “It’s not dieting to be thin, but dieting to be healthy.”
That being healthy is not only socially accepted, but celebrated and praised makes tackling the problem trickier.
“The big issue is that, intuitively, clean eating seems like it should be a good idea,” said Suman Ambwani. “Think about the language that’s being used. The opposite of clean is dirty. Nobody wants to follow dirty eating.”
As a result, hashtags like #eatclean #cleaneating and variations of them have millions of posts and followers on Instagram.
“That’s what I would really fuel myself with — so many podcasts and social media,” Bloomberg told me. “The whole reason I got on Instagram is because I was doing the ‘Whole 30’ challenge,” she said, referring to a routine in which participants would eat only whole foods for 30 days and post all their meals on the image-sharing platform.
“I didn’t have social media but it was recommended that you have it to keep yourself accountable.” she added. “There’s so much support for eating ‘healthy,’ which some people can do, but for me, somebody more prone to disordered eating, I will read it and it is like dogma to me.”
Experts believe that, while social media cannot be blamed alone, the competitive and performative nature of online clean eating culture can lead people to adopt progressively stricter diets, which can eventually lead to health problems.
“It’s a lot easier to get to a really bad place if you’re comparing yourself with the world of Instagram and not just your peer group and your friends that are in your neighborhood,” said Dunn.
The pseudoscientific fear-mongering around certain types of food and ingredients by popular accounts — describing conventional, “non-organic” produce as dangerous or claiming that gluten should be avoided, even when there is no medical necessity — makes the trend even more hazardous.
Debunking those is what Food Science Babe, a popular Instagram account, does. Erin, the woman behind it, who prefers not to give her last name, is a qualified food scientist. In her professional opinion, people who choose to eliminate certain foods from their diets need to have easy access to science-backed knowledge before doing so.
“I just think those decisions should be based on factual information, versus being scared into thinking you’re poisoning yourself if you’re eating these things, which you’re not,” she told me.
For all its problems, she also believes that social media has become an important medium for nutritionists and health experts to provide solid scientific facts to a global audience. In addition to her presence on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, she recently embraced TikTok as a way to reach a younger demographic.
Bloomberg feels the same way. After nine years, she came to the realization that her fixation with clean eating was damaging her relationships and potentially putting the health of herself and her daughter at risk. Rather than abandoning the internet, she simply changed track, embracing the body positivity movement and curating her social media feeds around it. Now, she accepts the benefits of an inclusive and balanced diet.
As Erin told me, “Clean is a meaningless term, when it comes to food, unless you’re literally talking about dirt.”",Mariam Kiparoidze,"Apr 10, 2021 8:31 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/countries-emphasize-importance-astrazeneca-shot-look-alternatives/,Countries emphasize importance of AstraZeneca shot as they look to alternatives,"Australia said on Friday, April 9, it had ordered more alternatives for the AstraZeneca vaccine, setting back its vaccination rollout, and Hong Kong delayed deliveries of the shot amid concern about a possible very small risk of rare blood clots.
The Australian decision effectively puts paid to plans to have its entire population vaccinated by the end of October, highlighting the delicate public health balancing act the issue has created.
Millions of doses of the AstraZeneca shot have been safely administered around the world and millions more have been ordered but some countries have limited its use to older age groups as a precaution while cases of clotting are investigated.
Australia said it had doubled its order of the Pfizer shot after health authorities recommended that those under 50 take it instead of AstraZeneca, which had been the mainstay of its vaccination program.
“It is not a prohibition on the AstraZeneca vaccine,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra. “For those who are over 50, there is a strong encouragement to be taking this AstraZeneca vaccine.”
The Anglo-Swedish company said it respected the Australian recommendation and was working with regulators around the world “to understand the individual cases, epidemiology and possible mechanisms that could explain these extremely rare events.”
European and British medicine regulators said this week they had found possible links with extremely rare cases of brain blood clots, while emphatically reaffirming the vaccine’s importance in mass vaccination against COVID-19.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) received reports of 169 cases of the rare brain blood clot by early April, after 34 million doses had been administered, Sabine Straus, chair of the EMA’s safety committee, said this week.
Most of the cases reported had occurred in women under 60.
On Friday, the EMA said that if a causal relationship is confirmed or considered likely, regulatory action will be needed to minimize risk. It also said it was looking into Johnson & Johnson’s shot over reports of blood clots.
The AstraZeneca shot is by far the cheapest and most high-volume vaccine launched so far, making it likely to be central to many of the worldwide inoculation programs that are vital to curbing the global pandemic and averting damaging lockdowns.
Germany, one of several European countries which have recommended alternatives to AstraZeneca for people under 60, said on Friday a surge in infections meant a new lockdown was needed.
“Every day in which we don’t act, we lose lives,” Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, said.
Hong Kong Health Secretary Sophia Chan said the city would delay shipments of the AstraZeneca vaccine it had ordered this year to avoid other countries going short.
“We believe that AstraZeneca vaccines will not need to be supplied to Hong Kong this year, so as not to cause a waste when the vaccine is still in short supply globally,” she said.
The government was considering buying a new type of vaccine that may offer better protection, she added.
The Chinese-ruled city had ordered 7.5 million AstraZeneca doses, which were scheduled to arrive in the second half of 2021. But Chan said the global financial center had sufficient alternatives.
Costa Rica said on Thursday, April 8, it would use the AstraZeneca shot after assessing the EMA’s guidance.
More than 40,000 doses of the vaccine arrived in the country on Wednesday, April 7, the first delivery under an agreement for a million vaccines with the COVAX mechanism of the World Health Organization (WHO) and GAVI alliance to ensure vaccines reach poorer states.
All the countries recommending age limits have emphasized that the vaccine is effective and its benefits far outweigh the risks of catching COVID-19 for older people.
The top health body in France, where vaccine hesitancy is high, recommended on Friday that those over 55 who had received a first dose of the AstraZeneca shot be given an alternative for the second one.
The Haute Autorite de la Sante suggested they get a new-style messenger-RNA vaccine, confirming an earlier Reuters exclusive. Two such vaccines, one from Pfizer and BioNTech and another from Moderna, have been approved for use in France.
Messenger RNA vaccines prompt the human body to make a protein that mimics part of the virus, triggering an immune response. AstraZeneca’s shot generates an immune response using a harmless, weakened version of a chimpanzee common cold virus.
The French health body also said there should be an interval of 12 weeks between the two shots in such cases and recommended a study to assess the immune responses given by these mixed vaccine prescriptions.",Reuters,"Apr 9, 2021 10:30 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/scientists-call-new-probe-covid-19-origins-with-without-china/,Scientists call for new probe into COVID-19 origins – with or without China,"A joint China-World Health Organization (WHO) study into COVID-19 has provided no credible answers about how the pandemic began, and more rigorous investigations are required – with or without Beijing’s involvement, a group of international scientists and researchers said on Wednesday, April 7.
The joint study, released last week, said the likeliest transmission route for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, involved bats and other wildlife in China and southeast Asia. It all but ruled out the possibility it had leaked from a laboratory.
In an open letter, 24 scientists and researchers from Europe, the United States, Australia, and Japan said the study was tainted by politics.
“Their starting point was, let’s have as much compromise as is required to get some minimal cooperation from China,” said Jamie Metzl, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, who drafted the letter.
The letter said the study’s conclusions were based on unpublished Chinese research, while critical records and biological samples “remain inaccessible.”
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus said last week China had withheld data.
Liang Wannian, China’s senior COVID-19 expert, denied this and appeared to rule out any further joint investigations in China, saying the focus should shift to other countries.
Metzl said the world might have to “revert to Plan B” and conduct an investigation “in the most systematic way possible” without China’s involvement.
China has rejected allegations that SARS-CoV-2 leaked from a research laboratory in Wuhan, the city where COVID-19 was first identified.
The joint China-WHO study said the lab leak was “extremely unlikely,” saying there was “no record” that any laboratory had kept SARS-CoV-2-related viruses. Tedros said more research was required to “reach more robust conclusions.”
Metzl said China should disclose information that would allow the lab hypothesis to be disproved.
“China has databases of what viruses were being held…. There are lab notes of the work that was being done,” he said, “There are all kinds of scientists who are actually doing the work and we don’t have access to any of those resources, or any of those people.”",Reuters,"Apr 8, 2021 10:29 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/britain-says-do-not-give-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-under-30s/,Britain advises alternative to Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine for under-30s,"Britain should give an alternative to Oxford-AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine to under 30s where possible due to a “vanishingly” rare side effect of blood clots in the brain, Britain’s vaccine advisory committee said on Wednesday, April 7.
Safety concerns have prompted more than a dozen countries in recent weeks to suspend use of the vaccine, which has been given to tens of millions of people in Europe, after reports linking it to a brain blood clotting disorder in a few dozen recipients.
Wei Shen Lim, chair of the Britain’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said that based on the available data and evidence, the committee has advised that it was preferable for adults aged under 30 with no underlying conditions to be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine where available.
He said that for younger people, where the risks of hospitalization were much lower, the risk-benefit calculation of the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot meant others vaccines were preferable.
“We are advising a preference for one vaccine over another vaccine for a particular age group, really out of the utmost caution, rather than because we have any serious safety concerns,” Lim said at a briefing.
He said people should continue to have a second dose of the AstraZeneca shot if they had received a first dose.
It came after Britain’s MHRA medicine regulator identified a possible side-effect from the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca involving rare brain blood clotting.
Chief executive June Raine said that the benefits of the shot outweighed the risks for the vast majority, echoing an update from Europe’s medicine regulator also made on Wednesday.
Europe’s and Britain’s medicine regulators have been investigating small numbers of reports of a brain blood clots, know as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), that have occurred in combination with unusually low blood platelet levels after people have been given the shot.
Munir Pirmohamed, Chair of the Commission on Human Medicines, said that the link between cerebral blood clots, lower platelets and the AstraZeneca vaccine was “getting firmer”
“Absolute proof of the link between the vaccine adverse events will need extensive scientific work based on the currently available evidence,” he said at a news conference.
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam said the move would have only a negligible impact on the pace of Britain’s vaccine rollout.
The rollout of Moderna’s shot began on Wednesday, while Britain is also deploying Pfizer’s vaccine. Raine said that over 20 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses had been given by March 31, with 79 case reports of the side effect and 19 deaths.
“This is a vanishingly rare, but sadly quite serious, adverse event…and you can’t pick these kind of things up until you have literally deployed tens of millions of doses of vaccine,” Van-Tam said.",Reuters,"Apr 7, 2021 11:35 PM PHT"

Researchers who conducted the analysis said it was not clear how the virus was linked to psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression, but that these were the most common diagnoses among the 14 disorders they looked at.
Post-COVID cases of stroke, dementia and other neurological disorders were rarer, the researchers said, but were still significant, especially in those who had severe COVID-19.
This is a very important paper. It confirms beyond any reasonable doubt that COVID-19 affects both brain and mind in equal measure.

“Although the individual risks for most disorders are small, the effect across the whole population may be substantial,” said Paul Harrison, a professor of psychiatry at Oxford University who co-led the work.
Max Taquet, also an Oxford psychiatrist who worked with Harrison, noted that the study was not able to examine the biological or psychological mechanisms involved, but said urgent research is needed to identify these “with a view to preventing or treating them”.
Health experts are increasingly concerned by evidence of higher risks of brain and mental health disorders among COVID-19 survivors. A previous study by the same researchers found last year that 20% of COVID-19 survivors were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder within 3 months.
The new findings, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, analyzed health records of 236,379 COVID-19 patients, mostly from the United States, and found 34% had been diagnosed with neurological or psychiatric illnesses within 6 months.
The disorders were significantly more common in COVID-19 patients than in comparison groups of people who recovered from flu or other respiratory infections over the same time period, the scientists said, suggesting COVID-19 had a specific impact.
Anxiety, at 17%, and mood disorders, at 14%, were the most common, and did not appear to be related to how mild or severe the patient’s COVID-19 infection had been.
Among those who had been admitted to intensive care with severe COVID-19 however, 7% had a stroke within six months, and almost 2% were diagnosed with dementia.
Independent experts said the findings were worrying.

“Scaling up production and equitable distribution remains the major barrier to ending the acute stage of the COVID-19 pandemic,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference.
“It’s a travesty that in some countries health workers and those at-risk groups remain completely unvaccinated.”
The COVAX facility, led by the WHO and GAVI vaccine alliance, has delivered 36 million doses to 86 countries and economies over the past six weeks, Tedros said.
The president of Namibia, Hage Geingob, one of several leaders invited to speak ahead of World Health Day on Wednesday, decried what he called “vaccine apartheid” under which some countries were forced to wait while others obtained doses.
Geingob said Namibia had received COVID-19 vaccines from “our good friends” India and China, but was still waiting for other vaccines despite having paid a deposit for them.
Tedros said Namibia would receive some vaccines from the COVAX program in around two weeks.
Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley said her Caribbean island nation had received its first tranche of vaccines via COVAX on Tuesday, enough to cover 3% of its population.
“But for many globally, this has been a difficult exercise. Because as we’ve seen the spikes (in disease) can literally grow, (and) we’ve not had access even when we are prepared to pay,” she said.

A 44-year-old man was admitted to a Melbourne hospital with clotting, days after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine, suffering serious thrombosis, a condition that prevents normal blood flow through the circulatory system.
The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) regulator and a panel, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI), met late Friday and early Saturday to discuss further advice on the AstraZeneca vaccine.
“We have not been advised at this time by ATAGI or the TGA to pause the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Australia,” Australia’s deputy chief medical officer, Michael Kidd, told a televised briefing Saturday afternoon.
Kidd said, however, that the blood clotting case is “likely” related to the vaccine.
“The risks of serious side effects remain very low, but safety is paramount and that is why TAGI and the TGA are continuing to do due diligence on this case,” Kidd said, adding that further announcements would come next week.
On Thursday, Britain identified 30 cases of rare blood clot events following use of the vaccine. Several nations, including Canada, France, Germany and Spain, limited its use after similar reports.
Possible complications with the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine could further slow the already delayed inoculation drive in Australia.
Australia launched mass vaccinations for its 25 million people in February, with most expected to receive the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, as 50 million doses are being produced domestically by CSL Ltd.
The country has had troubles, however, rolling out the program, missing a March target by about 3.3 million doses as states and the federal government bickered over the blame.
The troubles follow a year of significant success curbing the virus, with snap lockdowns, border closures and swift tracking limiting coronavirus infections to just under 29,300 infections, with 909 COVID-19 deaths.
On Saturday, Queensland state, the epicenter of the most recent small outbreak of the coronavirus, recorded one new infection, health officials said, but risks to the public were minimal as the victim had been in isolation for days.

The shot was also 100% effective in preventing illness among trial participants in South Africa, where a new variant called B1351 is dominant, although that rate was derived from a relatively small number of nine infections observed there, which were all in the placebo group, Pfizer said.
While the new overall efficacy rate of 91.3% is lower than the 95% originally reported in November for its 44,000-person trial, a number of variants have become more prevalent around the world since then.
Pfizer’s Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said the updated result, which includes data on more than 12,000 people fully inoculated for at least six months, positions the drugmakers to submit for full US regulatory approval.
The vaccine is currently authorized on an emergency basis by the US Food and Drug Administration.
The trial data “provide the first clinical results that a vaccine can effectively protect against currently circulating variants, a critical factor to reach herd immunity and end this pandemic for the global population,” Ugur Sahin, chief executive officer at BioNTech, said in a statement.
Experts fear new variants of COVID-19 from South Africa and Brazil may be resistant to existing vaccines and treatment. More than 300 cases of the South African variant have been detected in more than 25 US states and jurisdictions, according to federal data.
Lab tests have previously indicated that BioNTech’s vaccine was less potent but still offered a robust defense against the B1351 variant that first emerged in South Africa.
Still, BioNTech reiterated this week there would likely be a future need for booster shots that specifically address new variants and that the group was preparing to upgrade its vaccine when needed.
BioNTech has said that it started testing a modified vaccine version against the South African mutant in March for early indications on safety and efficacy but a product for later market launch would require yet another redesign and more tests.
The updated trial data would not prompt the company to change that development strategy, a BioNTech spokeswoman said.
The vaccine was 100% effective in preventing severe disease as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 95.3% effective in preventing severe disease as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration.
There were also no serious safety concerns observed in trial participants up to six months after the second dose, the companies said.
They added that it was generally equally effective irrespective of age, race, gender or ethnicity, and among participants with a variety of existing medical conditions.
The trial reviewed more than 900 confirmed cases of COVID-19, most of which were among participants who received a placebo.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-joins-europe-merck-recommending-against-ivermectin-for-covid-19/,"WHO joins Europe, Merck in recommending against Ivermectin for COVID-19","The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, March 31, recommended against using generic anti-parasite drug Ivermectin in patients with COVID-19 except for clinical trials, because of a lack of data demonstrating its benefits.
The recommendation follows the European Medicines Agency’s warning last week against the drug. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also recommended it not be used for COVID-19.
Officials in the Bolivian city of Trinidad launched a campaign in May last year to give out free doses of Ivermectin to combat the coronavirus, although the South American country’s health ministry noted the lack of evidence for it as a treatment.
Ivermectin tablets have been approved for treating some worm infestations and for veterinary use in animals for parasites. Merck, an Ivermectin manufacturer, has also said its analysis did not support the drug’s safety and efficacy for COVID-19.
“This applies to patients with COVID-19 of any disease severity,” Janet Diaz, a top WHO official for clinical care response, told reporters of the WHO recommendation, saying it was “based on very low certainty of evidence” that Ivermectin helps.
The WHO’s review was based on a survey of 16 trials of Ivermectin involving 2,400 people, including those comparing it with hydroxychloroquine, an older malaria medicine that has been discredited as a COVID-19 treatment. There were very few placebo-controlled studies of Ivermectin.
“We certainly need more data in order to make informed decisions,” said Bram Rochwerg, an associate professor at Canada’s McMaster University and a co-chair of the WHO panel that reviewed Ivermectin.
He said the data available was sparse and likely based on chance, though he said “high quality, trustworthy trials” were still merited.
“We did see an increase in adverse effects in patients that were randomized to Ivermectin,” he said, citing gastrointestinal upsets and headaches.
Worldwide, he said, there are 66 trials of Ivermectin registered, with 60,000 participants, so more data on its impact on the pandemic could be coming.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-safe-effective-adolescents-trial/,"Pfizer says COVID-19 vaccine safe, effective on adolescents in trial","Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective and produces robust antibody responses in 12 to 15-year olds, they said on Wednesday, March 31, paving the way for them to seek US and European approval in weeks to use the shot in this age group.
The read-out from a clinical trial, which puts the pair ahead of other Western vaccine developers in the quest to protect children, will likely allow for the use of the vaccine in that group before the next school year, Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s chief executive, said in a statement.
Whether COVID-19 vaccines work and are safe to use on children is one of the big questions drugmakers are trying to answer. Inoculating children and young people is considered a critical step towards reaching “herd immunity” and taming the pandemic, which has killed more than 2.9 million and infected 128.3 million.
Young people are less likely to have severe disease and more likely to have asymptomatic infection, allowing them to transmit the disease to others, said Dr Peter English, a retired consultant in communicable disease control.
The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine is already authorized for use in people starting at age 16. The new study offers the first evidence of how the vaccine will also work in school-age adolescents.
In the trial of 2,260 adolescents aged 12 to 15, there were 18 cases of COVID-19 in the group that got a placebo shot and none in the group that got the vaccine, resulting in 100% efficacy in preventing COVID-19, the companies said in a statement.
The vaccine was well tolerated, with side effects in line with those seen among those aged 16 to 25 in the adult trial. The companies did not list the side effects for the younger group, but the adult trial’s side effects generally were mild to moderate and included injection-site pain, headaches, fever and fatigue.
The companies also studied a subset of teens to measure the level of virus-neutralizing antibodies a month after the second dose and found it was comparable to study participants aged 16 to 25 in the pivotal trial in adults.
Bourla said the company planned to seek emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “in the coming weeks and … (from) other regulators around the world, with the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year.”
Shortly after the news, Israel, which is leading the world in its vaccination rollout, said it would start administering the shot to adolescents if the FDA gives it the green light.
Scientists welcomed the news, which has not been published in a medical journal or peer reviewed, but said more data was needed.
“It will be important to do this (vaccinate younger people to achieve herd immunity,” said English, who is also former chair of the British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee.
Last week, the companies gave the first vaccine doses in a series of trials testing the vaccine in younger children, that will eventually go to those as young as 6 months of age.
Rivals are also testing their shots on younger people.
A trial by Moderna Inc to test its COVID-19 vaccine in children aged six months to less than 12 years was launched this month, while Johnson & Johnson, which recently won approval for its vaccine in adults, has yet to begin a planned trial on children.
AstraZeneca in December removed children from a mid-to-late stage trial of its COVID-19 vaccine in Britain.
The British drugmaker’s vaccine has been linked this year with a very rare form of blood clotting in the brain, prompting some European countries to halt its use in younger adults even though the cause of the condition remains unclear.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/can-giving-up-masturbation-really-boost-men-testosterone-levels/,Can giving up masturbation really boost men’s testosterone levels?,"Nofap is a growing online movement devoted to giving up masturbation and even sex for extended periods – typically around 90 days. Starting as a spin-off from a 2011 thread on Reddit, the organization NoFap.com describes itself as a community-centered sexual health platform, designed to help people overcome porn addiction and compulsive sexual behavior.
The claimed benefits, however, have now extended the reach of nofap beyond the realms of porn addiction recovery and into mainstream health and lifestyle initiatives. Advocates of nofap are heralding an array of sexual, physical, and mental improvements – including increased testosterone levels. But is there any evidence to back this up?
There are many movements that are similar to nofap, such as semen retention, and they all appear to be predominantly aimed at and practiced by straight men, with only smaller pockets of women and LGBTQ+ people participating. It has also been taken up by certain far-right and misogynist groups, such as Proud Boys.
Testosterone in men does indeed have profound effects on mood, being demonstrated to improve depression, happiness, and motivation. It is clearly linked to muscle growth and physical performance (that’s why it is a banned supplementary substance in most sporting events). And many aspects of male sexual function are reliant on testosterone. So why wouldn’t we connect the dots between nofap and testosterone?
Well, the main reason is the evidence. Two studies keep popping up when evidence is quoted to support benefits of sexual abstinence as a means to increase testosterone. In the first one, 10 men had their testosterone levels measured twice (baseline) before masturbation and orgasm (several tests are more reliable than just one), and then in 10-minute intervals after.
This was followed by a three-week period in which they were instructed to refrain from “any type of sexual activity.” After that period, the process was repeated. Testosterone was reported as being higher in the baseline measurements after abstinence.
Despite the conclusions of the research, the sample size of this study was tiny. And the increase in testosterone may have actually been due to the anticipation of sexual arousal in the second experiment after abstinence. What’s more, testosterone levels at the first baseline measurement were actually the same before and after abstinence, with only the second measurement differing slightly. So without more data it is impossible to really say that abstinence increases testosterone at all.
The second study reported a 45% increase in testosterone levels after seven days of abstinence. But this was a temporary peak which then returned to the same levels as before, even with continued abstinence, and stayed that way. Such transient alterations in testosterone levels are unlikely to have any lasting effects on men’s health and may primarily serve as a regulator of the creation of new sperm.
A few studies, on the other hand, have shown either no effect of abstinence on testosterone or that testosterone levels were actually higher after masturbation or sex. Measuring testosterone before and directly after masturbation in 34 healthy young men found that testosterone levels increased after self stimulation. But any longer term effects were not checked. At best, the evidence linking masturbation with changes in testosterone levels is limited and with mixed conclusions.
Countering the argument for nofap is the well-documented benefits of sexual activity, including masturbation, on health. The release of endorphins during orgasm leads to positive feelings. Masturbation can help relieve built-up stress and assist relaxation, improve sleep, boost mood, release sexual tension and cramps and even allow a better understanding of sexual wants and needs. And in men there may even be some possible protection against prostate cancer from regular ejaculation, although this relationship is not fully clear yet.
In fact, masturbation as such doesn’t appear to have any negative effects on sexual and general health, and particularly in relation to testosterone levels in men. The problem may lie in excessive masturbation and attitudes towards self pleasure.
Personal perceptions of masturbation can cause psychological effects that impact testosterone levels. A build-up of anxiety and depression can occur if someone has feelings of guilt following masturbation. This guilt could be based around feeling immoral, such as being unfaithful to a partner or having religious conflicts. A study investigating the motivation for abstinence found that the reason was mostly due to attitudes, specifically the perception of masturbation as unhealthy or wrong.
This stress from prolonged guilt, anxiety, and depression can cause decreases in testosterone levels and in these situations, abstinence may relieve such feelings and could then theoretically lead to a testosterone increase. Maybe, then, the argument shouldn’t be about changing the tendency or frequency of masturbation, but more about improving understanding and attitudes towards sexual behaviour.
That said, abstaining from masturbation could help people with destructive porn addictions. Taking a break from pornography, masturbation, or even sex altogether for an extended period of time could help break the cycle, or reboot from porn addiction. Beyond this, though, health benefits of nofap are anecdotal and evidence to show abstinence even alters testosterone at all is simply not there.
So for anyone embarking on a period of “fapstinence” as a health fad, there is no apparent harm in trying and there might even be perceived improvements in certain aspects of life. But bear in mind that there is no reason to believe that nofap will meaningfully boost your testosterone levels and you may be missing out on the many benefits of healthy masturbation. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-moderna-covid-19-vaccines-highly-effective-first-shot-real-world-use/,"Pfizer, Moderna COVID-19 vaccines highly effective after first shot in real-world use – study","COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc with BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc reduced risk of infection by 80% two weeks or more after the first of two shots, according to data from a real-world US study released on Monday, March 29.
The risk of infection fell 90% by two weeks after the second shot, the study of nearly 4,000 US healthcare personnel and first responders found.
The results validate earlier studies that had indicated the vaccines begin to work soon after a first dose, and confirm that they also prevent asymptomatic infections.
Some countries dealing with limited vaccine supplies have pushed back schedules for second doses with the hope of getting some protection to more people. US public health officials, however, continue to recommend two doses be given on the schedule authorized by regulators based on clinical trials.
The study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) evaluated the vaccines’ ability to protect against infection, including infections that did not cause symptoms. Previous clinical trials by the companies evaluated their vaccine’s efficacy in preventing illness from COVID-19, but those studies would have missed asymptomatic infections.
The findings from of the real-world use of these messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines also confirm the efficacy demonstrated in the large controlled clinical trials conducted before they received emergency use authorizations from the US Food and Drug Administration.
The study looked at the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines among 3,950 participants in six states over a 13-week period from December 14, 2020 to March 13, 2021. About 74% had at least one shot, and tests were conducted weekly to catch any infections without symptoms.
“The authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines provided early, substantial real-world protection against infection for our nation’s healthcare personnel, first responders, and other frontline essential workers,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.
The new mRNA technology is a synthetic form of a natural chemical messenger being used to instruct cells to make proteins that mirror part of the novel coronavirus. That teaches the immune system to recognize and attack the actual virus.
The CDC study comes weeks after real-world data from Israel suggested that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 94% effective in preventing asymptomatic infections.
Britain and Canada were among the countries that have allowed extended gaps between doses of up to three or four months. UK authorities said in January that data supported its decision for a 12-week gap between doses.
Pfizer and its German partner have warned that they had no evidence to prove that. In their pivotal trials, there was a three-week gap between Pfizer shots and four weeks for the Moderna vaccine.
The CDC said the study results on Monday provide reassurance that people start to develop protection from the vaccine two weeks after their first dose, although the agency reiterated that the greatest protection was seen among those who had received both recommended doses of the vaccines.",Reuters,"Mar 30, 2021 9:30 AM PHT"

The reported findings match what WHO officials have said in the past about their conclusions following a January-February visit to China.
Many questions remain unanswered, and the team proposed further research in every area except the lab leak hypothesis, the Associated Press reported, citing a draft copy it had obtained.
WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus acknowledged receipt of the report from the independent experts but declined to give details, telling a Geneva news briefing: “All hypotheses are on the table and warrant complete and further studies.”
The 400-page report, drawn up by the team which carried out a mission to the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus was first encountered in late 2019, is to be issued on Tuesday, March 30, after diplomats from WHO’s 194 member states are briefed on its findings, Tedros said.
Germany’s international development minister Gerd Mueller, speaking to the same briefing after holding talks with Tedros, welcomed China’s cooperation with the probe.
The United States expects the WHO-led investigation to require further study of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, perhaps including a return visit to China, a senior US official told reporters last week. He hoped it would be “based on science.”

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/human-fetus-cells-important-developing-vaccines-not-ingredient/,Human fetus cells important for developing vaccines – but not an ingredient,"The US Conference of Catholic Bishops recently issued a statement advising Catholics to opt for the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, if possible, because human embryonic cells collected from an aborted fetus were used to develop the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
Using human embryonic cells from aborted fetuses in vaccine development has been controversial for some faiths. Given the severity of the pandemic and the necessity that a significant percentage of the population must be vaccinated to protect public health, most faith communities have publicly stated it is morally acceptable to receive any of the authorized vaccinations, even those that used cells that have been replicated from those originally taken from aborted fetuses in their development. These replicated cells are known as cell lines.
Human embryonic cells have been used to develop safe and effective vaccines since the 1960s and have played varying roles in the rapid development of six of the eight authorized COVID-19 vaccines.
Modern vaccination has come a long way since 1796 when Edward Jenner infected his first “patient” with cowpox to prevent smallpox. One modern vaccination strategy is to hack viruses to deliver immunity. The adenovirus, a virus that can cause the common cold and other respiratory illness, has been re-engineered to create vaccines, including the Johnson & Johnson, Oxford/AstraZeneca, CanSino, and Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccines.
The adenovirus is stripped of its original instructions, or genes, that trigger disease, and replaced with blueprints for a small part of the coronavirus – the spike protein. The body’s immune system recognizes the spike protein as foreign and makes antibodies that then protect against future coronavirus infection.
Viruses are not alive and need to infect cells to propagate. To make enough re-engineered adenovirus for vaccines, cells that closely resemble the target of vaccination (humans) are needed. This is one reason scientists use human cells to create adenovirus-based vaccines. The adenovirus used in these vaccines also tends to infect human cells better than other animal cell types, making it easier to create more copies of the virus in human cells. For this, embryonic cell lines are sometimes used.
Two embryonic cell lines have been used to develop COVID-19 vaccines: human embryonic kidney cells called HEK 293 and human embryonic retinal cells called PER.C6. The PER.C6 cell line is from an elective abortion in the Netherlands in 1985, and the HEK 293 cell line comes from an undisclosed source (either spontaneous miscarriage or elective abortion) in the Netherlands in about 1972.
Johnson & Johnson used PER.C6 cells in their COVID-19 vaccine development, and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine used HEK 293 cells. CanSino Biologics and Gamaleya Research Institute’s Sputnik V vaccines have also used HEK 293 cells.
Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech used HEK 293 cells in their proof-of-concept tests to see effectively take up the genetic instructions contained in these vaccines and produce the required spike protein. But human embryonic cell lines were not used to make either company’s final vaccine.
HEK 293 and PER.C6 cell lines have been genetically altered to include the part of the adenovirus instructions that trigger replication of adenoviruses. This allows the production of a large amount of the final vaccination product and allows the removal of the adenoviral replication instructions in the vaccine.
This prevents further replication of the adenovirus in the patient. So the delivered dose of adenovirus infects a relatively controlled number of host cells, which create a limited amount of coronavirus spike protein, enough for the body to mount an immune response.
After a large enough dose of coronavirus spike-containing adenoviruses is collected, the adenovirus is purified and isolated from the embryonic cell material for inclusion in the vaccine. No embryonic cells are included in the actual vaccine.
Before human embryonic cell lines were available, animal cell lines, such as monkey kidney, dog kidney, and chicken embryo cells, were used to develop vaccines.
Between 1955 and 1963, the polio vaccine was grown in monkey kidney cells that were later found to have been infected with a virus called simian virus 40 (SV40), making vaccinated people vulnerable to SV40 infection. Modern versions of the polio vaccine are still made in a similar manner but are now extensively filtered so that the original animal cell content is removed.
The polio vaccine is also an example of a different type of vaccination from the adenovirus-based vaccines. This type of vaccine is based on an inactivated version of the poliovirus that had been grown in monkey cells. Historically, concerns about potential contamination or endemic viral content in animal cell lines encouraged the search for and use of “cleaner” human cell lines.
Embryonic cell lines are considered “clean” since they have not had time to be infected by other potentially contaminating viruses, making them safe factories for generating adenovirus-based vaccines.
Using cells from electively aborted fetuses to develop vaccines is not new. Two human embryonic cell lines called WI-38 and MRC-5, derived from electively aborted fetuses in Sweden in 1962 and the UK in 1966, respectively, have historically been used to develop weakened or inactivated virus-based vaccines against chickenpox, shingles, rubella, hepatitis A, polio, and rabies.
The polio component of the Quadracell vaccine and rabies vaccine called Imovax are based on inactivated viruses cultured in MRC-5 cells developed by Sanofi-Pasteur. Imovax replaced potentially dangerous, sometimes deadly versions of the rabies vaccine that had been produced in animal tissue.
The hepatitis A, chickenpox, and shingles vaccines by Merck were produced using MRC-5 cells. Merck’s rubella component of the MMR vaccine along with the 1970 adenovirus vaccine were all produced using WI-38 cells.
In 2020, WI-38 cells were estimated to have saved over 10 million lives thanks to their contributions to the development of many vaccinations.
Despite their relatively recent foray into the biomedical field, human embryonic cell lines have made formidable contributions to modern medicine. They have played and promise to continue to play a major role in the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-vaccines-highly-effective-for-pregnant-women-babies-new-study/,COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective for pregnant women and their babies – new study,"COVID-19 vaccines are proving highly effective in pregnancy, according to a newly published study in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. It has also found that mothers who have been vaccinated are passing on precious immunity to their newborns.
A group of researchers in Massachusetts studied pregnant women’s response to two approved mRNA vaccines – Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna/NIH. The women were vaccinated either during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, and their ability to produce virus-specific antibodies was compared to that of vaccinated, non-pregnant women.
While the small number of women included in this study – 131 – is a limiting factor, it nonetheless provides very important early insight into the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy. This matters, because new infectious diseases can come with all kinds of risks for women during pregnancy and childbirth, as well as in the neonatal phase. All of these risks need to be considered when making healthcare decisions related to pregnant women and, in particular, when considering vaccine strategies.
While there remains a lot that we don’t yet know about the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their babies, there are some things we do know.
In early pregnancy, the virus is not associated with an increased chance of miscarriage. Vertical transmission – where the virus passes from the mother to the baby in the womb – is relatively rare. And babies seldom get sick.
We also know that, overall, pregnant women tend to have milder symptoms than the general population. However, they remain at greater risk of complications including placental inflammation and can become very ill. This in turn can lead to an increased likelihood of being admitted to intensive care and giving birth prematurely. As within the general population, pregnant women who are Black or Asian, as well as those who are obese, are at greater risk of severe COVID-19.
Now, of course, vaccination would prevent these outcomes. However, women are typically not included in any early vaccines trials if they’re pregnant. It is only now that data relating specifically to the response to the vaccine of pregnant and breast-feeding women are emerging. The work published in this paper is the first study to address this, making it incredibly valuable.
The Massachussets study focused on 84 pregnant women, 31 who were breast-feeding and 16 who were neither. The women each received two doses – what is known as prime and boost – of one of the vaccines. They had blood taken with each dose, and again up to 6 weeks after the second.
These blood samples were used to track the women’s antibody responses to the virus. The results were conclusive. All the women – both pregnant and breastfeeding – were found to have robust immunity, comparable to that of the non-pregnant women. And, this immunity increased with time, post-vaccination.
The researchers compared these findings with the antibody response in pregnant women who had contracted the virus naturally. This enabled them to show that the level of antibodies made in response to the vaccines far exceeded those made in response to natural infections.
One important reason to vaccinate pregnant women is so they can in turn provide their antibodies to the baby. This is known as passive immunity and it occurs when a mother is infected naturally or when she is vaccinated. The antibodies she produces are passed to her baby through the placenta or via breast milk. This affords the baby protection against infectious diseases it might come in contact with while its own immune system is still maturing. It is one of the reasons, for example, that pregnant women in many countries, including the UK, are encouraged to be vaccinated for flu and whooping cough.
When the babies in the study were delivered, the researchers studied blood samples from their umbilical cords. They found virus-specific antibodies in every sample. This shows that vaccinated mothers are passing antibodies to their babies through the placenta, in keeping with what we know from studies in natural infection. They also found virus-specific antibodies in breast milk from the women who were breastfeeding when vaccinated, which means that passive immunity is taking place via this route as well.
The investigators in this study were also able to provide some insight into when in pregnancy might be the best time to vaccinate pregnant women. Vaccinating women in different trimesters of their pregnancies did not affect antibody levels. This suggests that women can make a robust response to the vaccine at any stage of pregnancy.
In contrast, the analysis of umbilical cord blood shows that the second dose of a  vaccine is important for maximizing passive immunity for the baby. The lowest levels of antibodies in the umbilical cord samples came from a woman who delivered her baby before the second dose. The ability of the antibody to stop the entry of the virus into cells and cause infection also seems to need the boost dose. This suggests that having both doses before giving birth is critical to ensuring the baby gets the most protection possible.
There have been recent calls for pregnant women to be included at the early stages of vaccine trials, in order to limit delays in protecting them and their newborns. This study supports those calls.
It also highlights important next steps. Larger studies are needed to investigate when the best time in pregnancy is to vaccinate. These should include more detailed analysis of how the mothers respond to the vaccine at different stages of pregnancy, whether the vaccine prevents placental inflammation and preterm birth, and what effects this timing might have for passive immunity in newborns.
It points to other important questions too. How effective is the immunity transferred to the infant? And how long-lived is vaccine-induced viral immunity in the mother when the vaccination is made during pregnancy? We will need more studies to answer these questions. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

Britain in December opted to extend the gap between doses in its vaccine rollout to up to 12 weeks, with officials saying they were confident in their analysis that initial doses of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines generated some protection.
The study, led by Sheffield and Oxford Universities with support from  the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium, and released as a pre-print on Friday, found 99% of people generate strong immune responses  after one dose of the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine.
It backs up real-world data on Britain’s vaccine rollout from a study called SIREN which has found that one shot of either vaccine reduces severe disease.
“SIREN is actually showing very high vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization after a single dose, with the majority of these people having not had infection before. So what we’re trying to do is look at the mechanisms for that,” Susanna Dunachie of the University of Oxford’s Nuffield Department of Medicine, told reporters.
“We are seeing T-cell and antibody responses after one dose in people who have not had infection before. So we find that quite reassuring.”
The study is the largest real world study on T-cell and antibody  responses from Britain’s vaccine rollout, and looked at healthcare workers, mainly women, who were given one dose of the Pfizer shot.
The researchers analyzed blood samples from 237 people, and found that the antibody and T-cell responses in those who had not previously had COVID-19 resembled those generated by natural infection.
Those who had been previously infected generated a stronger and broader immune response, with a T-cell response that was around six times higher than those who had not been infected.
Thushan de Silva, study author from the University of Sheffield, also said that boosting pre-existing antibody responses could provide protection against coronavirus variants, including the one first discovered in South Africa which has been shown to reduce the efficacy of existing vaccines.",Reuters,"Mar 27, 2021 8:27 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/poor-messaging-distracts-sound-data-astrazeneca-vaccine-scientists/,Poor messaging distracts from sound data on AstraZeneca vaccine – scientists,"Scientists who have watched with dismay a series of disputes over AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine say strong efficacy data from a large US trial should lay concerns to rest, but worry the skirmishes may leave a lasting mark on public trust.
Spats with governments across Europe about production, supplies, possible side effects, and the vaccine’s merits have dogged the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker for months. And a highly unusual public rebuke from US scientists monitoring the government-funded trial this week added to its woes.
While the disputes have raised questions about AstraZeneca’s messaging and communications, what is crucial, scientists say, is that the product at the heart of all this appears sound.
On Thursday, the company said the vaccine was 76% effective in an updated analysis of its US trial after providing a slightly higher efficacy figure that was criticized for not being based on the most up-to-date data.
“One has to distinguish between the strong, positive data from the US trial on the one hand, and the amazing ability of AstraZeneca’s press release messaging to continually rescue defeat from the jaws of victory,” said Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London.
Among researchers working to develop vaccines, treatments, and other weapons against COVID-19, the frustration is evident.
Altmann told Reuters he is “impatient to get politics out of vaccinology and get us safe.”
A US trial investigator involved in evaluating AstraZeneca’s shot, who was not authorized to speak publicly, called the avoidable controversy “upsetting, because a lot of people worked really hard and the vaccine is really important. I do think it’s a good and effective vaccine.”
AstraZeneca defended its handling of US trial data this week, saying in a statement it was “in the public interest” for the company to disclose the interim results that shed more light on the vaccine’s ability to protect older adults and its safety.
AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 shot has faced questions since late last year, when the drugmaker and Oxford University published data from its first large-scale trial with two different efficacy readings as a result of a dosing error.
Uncertainty over how the dosing error came about raised questions about the robustness of the data, and differing accounts from AstraZeneca and Oxford added to concerns
Trust in the vaccine – and its developers – took a further hit this month, when more than a dozen countries temporarily suspended its use after reports of a rare blood clotting disorder in a very small number of people shortly after they were inoculated.
Ian Jones, a professor of virology at Britain’s Reading University, said it is “generally accepted that the early trial data, while positive, did suffer from a communication issue.”
The focus now, he agreed, should be results from the latest trial and from real-world use “which shows an excellent safety profile and the prevention of severe disease.”
AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine has so far been most widely used in Britain, where its rollout January, along with the Pfizer/BioNTEch shot, is helping reduce severe COVID-19 cases and deaths.
US scientists were taken aback on Tuesday by a midnight news release issued from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) raising doubts about the company’s announcement a day earlier that the vaccine was 79% effective at preventing COVID-19 in the U.S trial.
That was prompted by a letter from an independent data and safety monitoring board to the NIH saying the company had excluded more current data, which top US infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci called “a really unfortunate unforced error.”
That assessment seemed to be backed up by the updated results released by AstraZeneca on Thursday that were only marginally different.
“To have them write to the trial sponsor, which is the NIH, to say that they see a problem – no one I know has ever heard of this,” said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. “It’s damaged the company’s reputation in Washington, DC circles. It’s tarnished.”
Asked whether the NIH was satisfied with AstraZeneca’s latest news release, a spokesperson said via email, “NIH looks forward to the review by the US Food and Drug Administration.”

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/astrazeneca-says-covid-19-vaccine-76-percent-effective-in-new-analysis/,AstraZeneca says COVID-19 vaccine 76% effective in new analysis,"AstraZeneca’s said its COVID-19 vaccine was 76% effective in a new analysis of its US trial – only a tad lower than the level in an earlier report this week criticized for using outdated data.
Interim data published on Monday, March 22, had put the vaccine’s efficacy rate at 79% but had not included more recent infections, leading to a highly unusual public rebuke from US health officials.
The small revision to the efficacy rate will go a long way to putting the vaccine back on track for gaining US emergency use authorization – which it plans to seek in the coming weeks – and help AstraZeneca in its efforts to dispel doubts about its effectiveness and side-effects, independent experts said.
AstraZeneca also reiterated that the shot, developed with Oxford University, was 100% effective against severe or critical forms of the disease. There have been 8 severe cases – all among trial participants who received the placebo.
“The vaccine efficacy against severe disease, including death, puts the AZ vaccine in the same ballpark as the other vaccines,” said William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert from the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, adding that he expects the shot to gain US approval.
The latest data was based on 190 infections among more than 32,400 participants in the United States, Chile and Peru. The earlier interim data was based on 141 infections through Feb. 17.
It also said the vaccine showed 85% efficacy in adults 65 years and older, higher than the 80% rate reported on Monday.
AstraZeneca said the latest data has been presented to the independent trial oversight committee, the Data Safety Monitoring Board, and it plans to submit the analysis for peer-reviewed publication in the coming weeks.
“The primary analysis is consistent with our previously released interim analysis, and confirms that our COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective in adults,” Mene Pangalos, executive vice president of BioPharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca said in a statement.
The drugmaker noted there were 14 additional possible or probable cases to be analyzed so numbers in later updates of the trial results may fluctuate slightly.
The updated 76% efficacy rate compares with rates of about 95% for vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech  and Moderna in their trial data.
Experts have noted, however, that AstraZeneca’s latest data is particularly significant because it was compiled after more infectious variants of the coronavirus became prevalent.
“This appears to be a very effective vaccine with no safety concerns,” said Paul Griffin, a professor at the University of Queensland.
“Hopefully, this should now give people the confidence that this vaccine is the right one to continue to use moving forward,” he said, adding that he and his parents have received the vaccine.
AstraZeneca’s vaccine is seen as crucial in tackling the spread of COVID-19 across the globe, not just due to limited supply of vaccines but also because it is easier and cheaper to transport than rival shots. It has been granted conditional marketing or emergency use authorization in more than 70 countries.
The vaccine, once hailed as a milestone in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, has been dogged by questions since late last year when the drugmaker and Oxford University published data from an earlier trial with two different efficacy readings as a result of a dosing error.
Then this month, more than a dozen countries temporarily suspended giving out the vaccine after reports linked it to a rare blood clotting disorder in a very small number of people.
The European Union’s drug regulator said last week the vaccine was clearly safe, but Europeans remain skeptical about its safety.
Canada on Wednesday, March 24, said it was safe but added a warning to the vaccine’s label about rare blood clots.
Its rollout has also been marred by production glitches and export curbs imposed by India and the European Union, threatening to slow global efforts to end the pandemic which has killed more than 2.8 million.",Reuters,"Mar 25, 2021 2:34 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/astrazeneca-incomplete-efficacy-data-latest-covid-19-trial/,US health body questions robustness of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine trial data,"AstraZeneca may have provided an incomplete view of efficacy data on its COVID-19 vaccine from a large scale trial in the United States, a US health agency said Tuesday, March 23, in a fresh setback for the shot.
The concerns throw into question whether the British drugmaker can seek US emergency use authorization for the vaccine in the coming weeks as planned, and come just one day after interim data from the trial had shown better-than-expected results.
The vaccine developed with Oxford University was 79% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in the large trial that also took place in Chile and Peru, according to the data. It was also 100% effective against severe or critical forms of the disease and hospitalization and posed no increased risk of blood clots.
The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), an independent committee overseeing the trial, has “expressed concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data,” the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said in a statement.
NIAID is headed by US infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci and is part of the National Institutes of Health.
“We urge the company to work with the DSMB to review the efficacy data and ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible,” it said, adding that the DSMB had informed AstraZeneca of its concerns.
AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Authorization and guidelines for use of the vaccine in the United States will be determined after thorough review of the data by independent advisory committees, the NIAID statement added.
Hailed as a milestone in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic when it emerged as a vaccine contender last year, the AstraZeneca shot has since been dogged by doubts over its efficacy, dosing regimen and possible side effects.
More than a dozen European countries halted use of the vaccine earlier this month after reports linked it to a rare blood clotting disorder in a very small number of people.
Germany and France resumed inoculations after the EU’s drug regulator said last week it was safe but an opinion poll on Monday showed Europeans remained sceptical about its safety.
Fauci, who also serves as chief medical advisor to US President Joe Biden, said on Monday the US trial found no indication at all of the rare blood clots.
Before the blood clot concerns, there were also earlier separate late-stage studies that had raised questions about its dosing regimen and the lack of data about its efficacy for elderly people.
The latest data, which has yet to be reviewed by independent researchers, was based on 141 infections among 32,449 participants.
Analysts had also noted AstraZeneca’s achievement of producing strong trial data against a backdrop of more infectious variants spreading in the United States and other countries.
The AstraZeneca vaccine, which is already widely used outside the United States, is seen as crucial in tackling the spread of COVID-19 across the globe because it is easier and cheaper to transport than rival shots.

Many countries are relying heavily on it to end the pandemic, and several state leaders have taken the shot to boost confidence in the vaccine including South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in who received it on Tuesday.

The drugmaker said on Monday, March 22, that interim data from trials in Chile, Peru and the United States found the vaccine, developed in conjunction with Oxford University, was 79% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and, crucially, posed no increased risk of blood clots. It intends to request US emergency authorization in the coming weeks.
More than a dozen European countries, including Germany and France, had halted use of the AstraZeneca vaccine earlier this month after reports linked it to blood clots in a very small number of people. They have since resumed inoculation after a regional regulator said it was safe, but an opinion poll on Monday showed Europeans remained skeptical over its safety.

The latest data has yet to be reviewed by independent researchers, but it helps to address some of the concerns, analysts said.
“It is clear this vaccine has very good efficacy (remember that 60% was, prior to any trials being started, regarded as a good target), and that this efficacy does not show a notable decline at older ages,” Stephen Evans, Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said.
Based on more than 32,000 people, the trial was larger and around 20% of volunteers were aged 65 and above, compared to 5.7% in an earlier British trial. The scarcer data had made some European countries hesitant to use the AstraZeneca shot on older people.
“Seeing this data now I hope gives others increased confidence that this is a very effective and safe vaccine,” Mene Pangalos, an AstraZeneca executive vice-president, told a news briefing.
AstraZeneca shares were up 2.6% in London, their highest since February 19.
US trials of rival vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, which are being deployed in the United States, have showed efficacy rates of around 95%.
But the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is already widely used outside the United States, is seen as crucial to tackling the spread of COVID-19 across the globe because it is easier and cheaper to transport than rival shots.
Political leaders have come forward for the vaccine to try to boost confidence.
“I have just finished getting the (AstraZeneca) injection, there is no pain at the injection site, and there is no soreness of the body,” Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters as the island launched its inoculation campaign on Monday.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson received his first dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, March 19, saying he “did not feel a thing.”
And French President Emmanuel Macron has said he would take the AstraZeneca vaccine if that’s what was offered after previously being quoted as saying the shot was “quasi-ineffective.”
The AstraZeneca vaccine has already been granted a conditional marketing authorization or emergency use in more than 50 countries, spanning four continents.
But it has yet to be approved in the United States, where President Joe Biden is stepping up the federal response to the pandemic by expanding testing, ramping up vaccinations and boosting production.
University of Oxford professor Sarah Gilbert told BBC radio that work to prepare a submission for Emergency Use Authorization in the United States will take a few weeks. A company spokesman said the filing would likely be in the first half of April.
If the AstraZeneca vaccine gets US approval, it would be the fourth after Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Some analysts have said the United States might use its AstraZeneca stockpile to largely support other countries rather than for domestic use.
But Ruud Dobber, a AstraZeneca executive vice president, said on Monday he would be “very surprised” if the company’s vaccine were not used in the United States.
The AstraZeneca shot uses a modified version of a chimpanzee common cold virus to teach the human body to make proteins from the novel coronavirus to generate an immune response and prevent infection.
Many Asia-Pacific countries heavily rely on the AstraZeneca vaccine to end the pandemic, as the shot is being used in inoculation programs in Australia, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, and India.
Some states in India, which has the highest coronavirus caseload after the United States and Brazil, are seeking to accelerate the vaccination drive, as the country reported its most COVID-19 cases and deaths in months on Monday.
As vaccine demand rises at home, top producer the Serum Institute of India has delayed further shipments of the AstraZeneca shot to Brazil, Britain, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. .
AstraZeneca has set a target to produce 3 billion doses this year, with India’s Serum Institute making most of that aimed at poorer nations.
In Europe, meanwhile, the European Union has threatened to block exports of COVID-19 vaccines to Britain to safeguard scarce doses for its own citizens, with Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen saying the epidemiological situation was worsening.",Reuters,"Mar 22, 2021 4:19 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/how-effective-is-the-first-shot-of-the-pfizer-or-moderna-vaccine/,How effective is the first shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine?,"As the COVID-19 vaccines reach more people across the country, some people have asked: Could we delay the second dose of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to allow more people to be vaccinated more quickly? And, how safe am I after my first dose?
As an immunologist, I hear this question frequently. The answer is that a single dose is very effective – but I would add that you should still get both doses. The issue is important, however, not only for your personal health but also for the country’s health as leaders figure out how to ensure there’s enough vaccine for everyone who wants one.
A recent study in Israel showed that a single dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective, up to 85%.
The Sheba Medical Center reported its experience with vaccinating its nearly 10,000 staff members with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccination there started December 19, 2020, which coincided with the third wave of COVID-19 in Israel. The researchers looked to see the rate of reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease after vaccination. By January 24, 2021, 7,214 health care workers there had received a first dose, and 6,037 had received the second dose.
Altogether, there were 170 cases of infection between December 19, 2020, and January 24, 2021. Of those, 89 people, or 52%, were unvaccinated; 78 people, or 46%, tested positive after the first dose; and 3, or 2%, tested positive after the second dose.
This is consistent with a reanalysis of the phase 3 clinical trial data reported in 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine. In that study, the 52% protection from the first dose included infections that occurred in the first 10 days after vaccination, when one would not expect the vaccine to have had time to generate protective anti-spike antibodies.
Using the data from the published study of the Pfizer vaccine, Public Health England determined that vaccine efficacy was 89% for 15-21 days after dose 1 – and before dose 2 on day 21. The range was between 52% and 97%. For days 15-28, or up to the first week after the second dose, protection from the first dose was estimated at 91%. The range for this was between 74% and 97%. A second dose would not be expected to confer immunity within that time.
So what do we know? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges people to get both doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. You should be reassured that even after a single dose of either of those vaccines, you have very high levels of protection after your body has time to build immunity, about a week. The scheduled second dose of these vaccines makes them even more effective, but at a time where vaccine supplies are limited, there’s a lot to be said about prioritizing the first dose for the most people. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/technology/innovations/medical-innovations-fueled-by-covid-19-outlast-pandemic/,3 medical innovations fueled by COVID-19 that will outlast the pandemic,"A number of technologies and tools got a chance to prove themselves for the first time in the context of COVID-19. Three researchers working in gene-based vaccines, wearable diagnostics and drug discovery explain how their work rose to the challenge of the pandemic, and their hopes that each technology is now poised to continue making big changes in medicine.
Deborah Fuller, Professor of Microbiology, University of Washington
Thirty years ago, researchers for the first time injected mice with genes from a foreign pathogen to produce an immune response. Like many new discoveries, these first gene-based vaccines had their ups and downs. Early mRNA vaccines were hard to store and didn’t produce the right type of immunity. DNA vaccines were more stable but weren’t efficient at getting into the cell’s nucleus, so they failed to produce sufficient immunity.
Researchers slowly overcame the problems of stability, getting the genetic instructions where they needed to be and making them induce more effective immune responses. By 2019, academic labs and biotechnology companies all over the world had dozens of promising mRNA and DNA vaccines for infectious diseases, as well as for cancer in development or in phase 1 and phase 2 human clinical trials.
When COVID-19 struck, mRNA vaccines in particular were ready to be put to a real-world test. The 94% efficacy of the mRNA vaccines surpassed health officials’ highest expectations.
DNA and mRNA vaccines offer huge advantages over traditional types of vaccines, since they use only genetic code from a pathogen – rather than the entire virus or bacteria. Traditional vaccines take months, if not years, to develop. In contrast, once scientists get the genetic sequence of a new pathogen, they can design a DNA or mRNA vaccine in days, identify a lead candidate for clinical trials within weeks and have millions of doses manufactured within months. This is basically what happened with the coronavirus.
Gene-based vaccines also produce precise and effective immune responses. They stimulate not only antibodies that block an infection, but also a strong T cell response that can clear an infection if one occurs. This makes these vaccines better able to respond to mutations, and it also means they could be capable of eliminating chronic infections or cancerous cells.
The hopes that gene-based vaccines could one day provide a vaccine for malaria or HIV, cure cancer, replace less effective traditional vaccines or be ready to stop the next pandemic before it gets started are no longer far-fetched. Indeed, many DNA and mRNA vaccines against a wide range of infectious diseases, for treatment of chronic infections and for cancer are already in advanced stages and clinical trials.
As someone who has been working on these vaccines for decades, I believe their proven effectiveness against COVID-19 will usher in a new era of vaccinology with genetic vaccines at the forefront.

During the pandemic, researchers have taken full advantage of the proliferation of smartwatches, smart rings and other wearable health and wellness technology. These devices can measure a person’s temperature, heart rate, level of activity and other biometrics. With this information, researchers have been able to track and detect COVID-19 infections even before people notice they have any symptoms.
As wearable usage and adoption grew in recent years, researchers began studying the ability of these devices to monitor disease. However, although real-time data collection was possible, previous work had focused primarily on chronic diseases.
But the pandemic both served as a lens to focus many researchers in the field of health wearables and offered them an unprecedented opportunity to study real-time infectious disease detection. The number of people potentially affected by a single disease – COVID-19 – at one time gave researchers a large population to draw from and to test hypotheses on.
Combined with the fact that more people than ever are using wearables with health monitoring functions and that these devices collect lots of useful data, researchers were able to try to diagnose a disease solely using data from wearables – an experiment they could only dream of before.
Wearables can detect symptoms of COVID-19 or other illnesses before symptoms are noticeable. While they have proved to be capable of detecting sickness early, the symptoms wearables detect are not unique to COVID-19. These symptoms can be predictive of a number of potential illnesses or other health changes, and it is much harder to say what illness a person has versus simply saying they are sick with something.
Moving into the post-pandemic world, it’s likely that more people will incorporate wearables into their lives and that the devices will only improve. I expect the knowledge researchers have gained during the pandemic on how to use wearables to monitor health will form a starting point for how to handle future outbreaks – not just of viral pandemics, but potentially of other events such as food poisoning outbreaks and seasonal flu episodes.
But since wearable tech is concentrated within pockets of affluent and younger populations, the research community and society as a whole must simultaneously address the disparities that exist.
Nevan Krogan, Professor of Cellular Molecular Pharmacology and Director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute, University of California, San Francisco
Proteins are the molecular machines that make your cells function. When proteins malfunction or are hijacked by a pathogen, you often get disease. Most drugs work by disrupting the action of one or several of these malfunctioning or hijacked proteins.
So a logical way to look for new drugs to treat a specific disease is to study individual genes and proteins that are directly affected by that disease. For example, researchers know that the BRCA gene – a gene that protects your DNA from being damaged – is closely related to the development of breast and ovarian cancer. So a lot of work has focused on finding drugs that affect the function of the BRCA protein.
However, single proteins working in isolation are usually not solely responsible for disease. Genes and the proteins they encode are part of complicated networks – the BRCA protein interacts with tens to hundreds of other proteins that help it perform its cellular functions. My colleagues and I are part of a small but growing field of researchers who study these connections and interactions among proteins – what we call protein networks.
For a few years now, my colleagues and I have been exploring the potential of these networks to find more ways drugs could ameliorate disease. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, we knew we had to try this approach and see if it could be used to rapidly find a treatment for this emerging threat. We immediately started mapping the extensive network of human proteins that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks so it can replicate.
Once we built this map, we pinpointed human proteins in the network that drugs could easily target. We found 69 compounds that influence the proteins in the coronavirus network. Twenty-nine of them are already FDA-approved treatments for other illnesses. On January 25 we published a paper showing that one of the drugs, Aplidin (Plitidepsin), currently being used to treat cancer, is 27.5 times more potent than remdesivir in treating COVID-19, including one of the new variants The drug has been approved for phase 3 clinical trials in 12 countries as a treatment for the new coronavirus.
But this idea of mapping the protein interactions of diseases to look for novel drug targets doesn’t apply just to the coronavirus. We have now used this approach on other pathogens as well as other diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.
These maps are allowing us to connect the dots among many seemingly disparate aspects of single diseases and discover new ways drugs could treat them. We hope this approach will allow us and researchers in other areas of medicine to discover new therapeutic strategies and also see whether any old drugs might be repurposed to treat other conditions.",Albert H.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/existing-covid-19-vaccines-may-protect-against-brazilian-variant-oxford-study/,Existing COVID-19 vaccines may protect against Brazilian variant – Oxford study,"Existing vaccines may protect against the Brazilian variant of the coronavirus, according to a University of Oxford study which also highlighted how a variant first found in South Africa poses the biggest headache for vaccine makers.
Coronavirus variants with specific mutations to the spike protein are of concern because scientists worry they will reduce the efficacy of vaccines, as well as immunity gained from prior infection.
The scientists used blood samples from people with antibodies generated by both COVID-19 infection and the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines that are being rolled out in Britain.
The data showed a nearly three-fold reduction in the level of virus neutralization by antibodies generated by the vaccines for the P1 Brazil variant – similar to the reduction seen with the variant first identified in Kent, Britain.
“These data suggest that natural- and vaccine-induced antibodies can still neutralize these variants, but at lower levels,” it said. “Importantly, the P1 ‘Brazilian’ strain may be less resistant to these antibodies than first feared.”
The variant first identified in South Africa triggered a much larger reduction in virus neutralization, with a 9-fold reduction in Oxford/AstraZeneca’s vaccine, and a 7.6-fold reduction for Pfizer/BioNTech.
Last month, South Africa put use of AstraZeneca’s shot on hold after data showed it gave minimal protection against mild-to-moderate infection cause by the country’s dominant variant.
The authors of the study said that developing vaccines against the South Africa variant, known as B1351, should be the “greatest priority for vaccine developers globally.”
Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford University vaccine trial, said the study provided “new insights that help us be prepared to respond to further challenges to our health from the pandemic virus, if we need to do so.”

For every 3 people who died within 4 weeks after being infected with another variant in England between mid-November and mid-January, roughly 5 died who had been infected with B.1.1.7, according to a paper posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
Between November and January in Manaus, Brazil, the frequency of COVID-19 cases involving the P.1 coronavirus variant increased from non-existent to 73%, and the number of infections there quadrupled compared to what the city experienced in the first wave of the pandemic, according to another report posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
The greater infectiousness of the P.1 variant likely contributed to that, the report suggests.
Most worryingly, antibodies induced by the Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc/BioNTech vaccines are dramatically less effective at neutralizing some of the most worrying coronavirus variants, a third new study suggests.

Taiwan’s first vaccines – 117,000 doses of the AstraZeneca shot – arrived on the island earlier this month, though they have yet to start being administered.
In a video statement late on Wednesday, Chen said the doses, which came from a South Korean factory, had now cleared the last of the checks by Taiwan’s Food and Drug Administration.
The aim is to start administering them from as early as Monday, he added.
Around 60,000 people are in line to get the first vaccinations, Chen said.
Taiwan is prioritizing health workers to get the shots.
In December, Taiwan said it had agreed to buy almost 20 million vaccine doses, including 10 million from AstraZeneca.
More than a dozen European countries have suspended use of the vaccine this week amid concerns about its safety, though the World Health Organization said on Wednesday it considers that its benefits outweigh its risks and recommends that vaccinations continue.
Taiwan’s government has played down concerns about the late start to the vaccination program, pointing out that with such a low case rate there is not the urgency that exists in other countries where the pandemic remains rampant.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/coronavirus-do-we-have-moral-duty-not-get-sick/,Coronavirus: Do we have a moral duty not to get sick?,"The personal ethics of COVID-19 are a minefield. Over winter, disputes over our duties to one another with regard to the virus dominated Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year and they continue to raise questions, with many people back in lockdown. Now, with vaccines being rolled out around the world, questions have arisen about how the vaccinated and non-vaccinated should behave.
All these debates revolve around a single question – is it our moral obligation not to get sick in a pandemic? Philosophy holds some of the answers, which I explore in my book on the ethical lessons of lockdown.
There are two main rival models of ethics: one is based on rights, the other on duties. The rights-based model, which traces its philosophical origins to the work of John Locke in the 17th century, starts from the assumption that individuals have rights. In its most zealous expression it also adds that there are things no person or group (especially the state) may do to individuals without violating their rights. Under this model, individuals have a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
According to this approach, duties are related to rights, but only in a subordinate role. My right to free speech puts you under a duty to allow me to publish my satirical cartoons. My right to an education puts others under a duty not to harm me on my way to school. My right to health implies a duty on my country to provide some healthcare services, to the best of its abilities.
This is arguably the dominant interpretation when philosophers talk about rights, including human rights.
Rights play a crucial role in modern politics and ethics, and rightly so. We cannot think of modern life in the West without reflecting on hard-fought rights. A law was approved in France in 2018, for example, which gives citizens the “right to make mistakes” in dealings with the government without being automatically punished. This is to be welcomed.
But what started as a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness has evolved to justify many other claims, including the right to get sick, or at the very least the right to risk getting sick. During the pandemic, this right has been taken to menacing excesses by anti-mask and anti-lockown groups, politically active in almost every country around the world.
This is the ugly side to rights-based theories. Your right to get sick, or to risk getting sick, could imply a duty on others to look after you during your illness.
In the exceptional times in which we find ourselves, putting rights before duties is beyond the realm of justification. The right to get sick is potentially deadly, and not only for the person getting sick: thousands of frontline healthcare workers have died worldwide from COVID-19 after caring for infected patients.
COVID-19 is forcing us to revisit some of our most entrenched moral assumptions and embrace new perspectives. Contrary to what the rights-based model would suggest, from a moral point of view, it is a mistake to think of duties merely as correlated and subordinate to rights.
The pre-eminence of rights in our moral compass has vindicated unacceptable levels of selfishness. It is imperative to undertake a fundamental duty not to get sick, and to do everything in our means to avoid causing others to get sick. Morally speaking, duties should come first and should not be subordinated to rights.
Putting duties before rights is not a new, revolutionary idea. In fact it is one of the oldest rules in the book of ethics. Primum non nocere, or first do no harm, is the core principle in the Hippocratic Oath historically taken by doctors, widely attributed to the ancient Greek philosopher and physician Hippocrates. It is also a fundamental principle in the moral philosophy of the Roman statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero, who in De Officiis (On Duties) argues that the first task of justice is to prevent men and women from causing harm to others.
When it comes to navigating the morality of living with COVID-19, we could do a lot worse than following the moral teachings of our ancestors. Because yes, we do have a moral duty to avoid catching this disease. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-reinfection-rare-more-common-older-people/,"COVID-19 reinfection rare, but more common in older people – study","The majority of people who have had COVID-19 are protected from getting it again for at least six months, a study published on Wednesday, March 17, showed, but older people are more prone to reinfection than younger people.
The study, appearing in the Lancet medical journal, found that just 0.65% of patients tested positive a second time for COVID-19 after previously being infected during Denmark’s first and second waves. That was much lower than the 3.27% who were positive for the virus using highly accurate PCR tests after initially being negative.
However, the study found that people over the age of 65 had only 47% protection against repeat infection, compared to 80% protection for younger people.
“Our study confirms what a number of others appeared to suggest: reinfection with COVID-19 is rare in younger, healthy people, but the elderly are at greater risk of catching it again,” said Steen Ethelberg of Denmark’s Statens Serum Institut.
“Since older people are also more likely to experience severe disease symptoms, and sadly die, our findings make clear how important it is to implement policies to protect the elderly during the pandemic.”
The authors of the study found no evidence that protection against reinfection declined over a six month follow-up period, but said further studies were needed to assess protection against reinfection from variants of the coronavirus.
The data analyzed was collected through Denmark’s national testing strategy, under which 69% of the population, or 4 million people, were tested over the course of 2020.
Commenting on the results, Imperial College London professors Rosemary Boyton and Danny Altmann, said the results showed lower protection and were “more concerning” than previous studies.
“These data are all confirmation, if it were needed, that for SARS-CoV-2 the hope of protective immunity through natural infections might not be within our reach and a global vaccination program with high efficacy vaccines is the enduring solution,” they said in a linked comment piece also published in the Lancet.",Reuters,"Mar 18, 2021 11:01 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/blood-clots-reasons-they-may-happen/,Blood clots: 5 reasons they may happen,"There’s been a lot of concern in recent days about blood clots, particularly after reports from Germany of people developing cerebral vein thrombosis – a blood clot in the brain – after receiving the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Other European countries have raised concerns about potentially increased risks of pulmonary embolisms and deep-vein thrombosis following vaccination.
However, AstraZeneca says there is currently no evidence that clots are associated with the vaccine, and the number of blood clots reported after having the vaccine is no greater than what would occur normally.
Clotting, also known as the coagulation system, is an extremely important function in the human body. Clotting helps prevent excessive blood loss both inside and outside the body when our skin, internal organs, or vessels get damaged.
But though it may be a normal and essential process, if a clot becomes dislodged from where it has formed, it can become dangerous – especially if it becomes lodged in an organ, or in an artery that’s too narrow for it to fit through. This is typically known as an embolus. This can block arterial blood flow, which is essential to vital organs and may result in a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs), ischaemic stroke (clot in the brain), or a heart attack. They can also block veins, such as a deep vein thrombosis in the legs – known as a thrombus.
Many things can increase a person’s chance of developing a blood clot. Here are five:
People who are obese are more than twice as likely to develop a thrombus (blood clot in the leg) compared with people of a normal weight. This is because obesity causes chronic inflammation and reduced fibrinolysis (ability to breakdown clots).
Chronic inflammation also happens as a result of having less nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide is a molecule that protects the specialized endothelium (the blood vessel’s lining) and prevents cells from sticking to the endothelial surface. Even at an early age, people who are obese have significantly lower levels of nitric oxide. It’s this reduced amount of nitric oxide in obese people that increases damage to the lining of blood vessels, in turn, increasing the risk of clots forming.
Smoking increases the risk of blood clots forming by up to three-fold.
As with obesity, smoking reduces the amount of nitric oxide in the body and encourages the blood to stick together to form clots. This process is driven in part by significantly increased levels of fibrinogen, an important component in clotting, present in the blood of smokers. Chemicals in cigarettes also cause platelets in the blood to stick together. Together, these factors make the blood thicker, making it harder for the heart to pump it around the body, in turn, damaging the inner lining of the blood vessels.
Traveling long distances in aircraft, or being immobilized for a long period after major surgery, can increase the risk of blood clots in the form of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) – blood clots in the legs. The typical incidence of DVT is one in 1,000, but it increases up to three-fold on flights longer than three hours.
Because the blood is not flowing as much, the cells and proteins in blood settle out and form clumps. When the person starts moving again, these clots can move around the body and block a blood vessel if they are not broken down. Increased body mass index, age and smoking increase the risk of developing DVT from inactivity or on flights.
As many as one in four people who have had major trauma, which causes damage to blood vessels – such as if large bones have been broken – develop clots. In such cases, the clot formation is linked to both the injuries to the blood vessels themselves, as well as the often prolonged bed rest associated with treatment and recovery.
Similarly, people with cancer are five to seven times more likely to develop blood clots. This is because some cancers produce increasing amounts of coagulation factors that promote clotting. Cancer also damages healthy tissues, which causes them to swell and clot.
Women taking the combined oral contraceptive pill containing artificial oestrogen and progesterone have been found to have a small increased risk of blood clots. Other oral contraceptives show similar levels of increase, with about 6-17 extra events per 10,000 women treated depending on the drug used, compared with women who don’t take the oral contraceptive.
The ingredients in contraceptives increase the levels of several clotting factors circulating in the blood, which increases the odds of blood forming clots in veins.
Research also shows that COVID-19 patients have significantly elevated levels of a molecule that forms when clots are present. This is because COVID-19 attacks the endothelial cells lining blood vessels, causing an increase in clots throughout the body and presenting as a vascular disease. One study also found between 2%-9% of COVID-19 patients develop pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs). And COVID-19 patients are between three to six times more likely to develop blood clots in the veins compared with the rest of the population. Other factors – such as bed rest and age – may increase the risk of blood clots in COVID-19.
But while many factors can increase a person’s risk of blood clots, there’s still no evidence to suggest a link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/how-worried-reports-blood-clots-astrazeneca-vaccine/,How worried should we be about reports of blood clots and AstraZeneca’s vaccine?,"Europe’s drug watchdog is reviewing a small number of reports of bleeding, blood clots, and low platelet counts in people who have received AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said it has so far found no causal link between the vaccine and the incidents. The World Health Organization has also said there was no proven link and people should not panic.
At least 13 EU member states including Germany, France, and Italy have suspended use of the shot pending the outcome of EMA’s probe.
Here’s what we know so far.
More than 45 million COVID-19 shots by all manufacturers have been administered across the EU and the European Economic Area since vaccinations started almost three months ago.
The EMA is investigating reports of 30 cases of unusual blood disorders out of 5 million people who got the AstraZeneca vaccine in the EU.
The EMA’s focus and primary concern is on cases of blood clots in the head, a rare condition that’s difficult to treat called cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT).
In Germany, seven people aged 20 to 50 have been diagnosed with CVT up to 16 days after vaccination as per Monday, according to the national vaccine authority Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). Based on the known rate of CVT in the general population, the PEI would have expected one case in 1.6 million.
Britain has administered more than 11 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and reports of blood clots were no greater than would have occurred naturally. The UK’s medicine regulator has urged Britons to keep on getting their vaccines, including the AstraZeneca shot.
Canada has said health experts are sure all COVID-19 vaccines being administered in the country are safe, including AstraZeneca’s.
AstraZeneca said on Sunday, March 14, a review of safety data of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the United Kingdom and European Union with its vaccine had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.​
EMA investigators are checking if the frequency of incidences is higher in the vaccinated population than normal background rates.
The normal frequency is drawn from public health statistics or insurance records. This would be combined with a medical analysis of each case and insight from scientific literature.
EMA’s head of safety monitoring, Peter Arlett, added the rarity of CVT meant the watchdog would have to rely more heavily on case-by-case analysis rather than on the sparse statistical data.
A spokeswomen for Germany’s vaccine authority, which is part of the investigation, said EMA would not rule on causality.
Instead, EMA will assess the likelihood of an increased risk of the condition and weigh that against the benefits of fighting COVID-19 and providing relief for health systems.
For example, the vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna have been linked with increased risk of anaphylaxis, but they are still recommended because benefits outweigh the risks of the side effect, which can be treated.
The regulator has said it remains for now “firmly convinced” that the product’s benefit outweighs any risks.
AstraZeneca and European regulators have said that concerns about blood coagulation disorders did not emerge during human trials.
Safety monitoring after approval is key because extremely rare side-effects, or those affecting only a small subset of the population, are near impossible to identify during clinical trials, according to PEI.
In Japan, a governmental recommendation for use of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to prevent cervical cancer has been suspended since June 2013, due to media reports of an alleged pain syndrome. This has drawn criticism from the WHO.
A study published in The Lancet Public Health last year concluded a continued suspension would lead to thousands of cancer deaths over the next decades.
In Ukraine, deep mistrust of vaccines has allowed measles to grow into an epidemic. Vaccine hesitancy there is rooted in corruption and mistrust of authority but also in a temporary government suspension in 2008, when a 17-year-old boy died shortly after receiving a measles-rubella vaccine.",Reuters,"Mar 18, 2021 9:35 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-statement-astrazeneca-march-17-2021/,Benefits outweigh risks of AstraZeneca COVID-19 shot as review continues – WHO,"A World Health Organization (WHO) vaccine safety panel said on Wednesday, March 17, that it considers that the benefits of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine outweigh its risks and recommends that vaccinations continue.
The WHO listed AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s vaccine for emergency use last month, widening access to the relatively inexpensive shot in the developing world.
More than a dozen European countries have suspended use of the vaccine this week amid concerns.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said it was investigating reports of 30 cases of unusual blood disorders out of 5 million recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine. In total, 45 million COVID shots have been delivered across the region.
The EU regulator will release its findings on Thursday, March 18, but its head, Emer Cooke, said she saw no reason to change its recommendation of AstraZeneca – one of four vaccines that it has approved for use.
The WHO said its Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety is carefully assessing the latest available safety data for the AstraZeneca vaccine.
“Once that review is completed, WHO will immediately communicate the findings to the public,” WHO said in its statement a day after its experts held a closed-door meeting.
“At this time, WHO considers that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh its risks and recommends that vaccinations continue,” it added.
Kate O’Brien, director of WHO’s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, said that its vaccine safety panel was assessing whether adverse events such as blood clots were actually related to vaccination.
“We should not over-interpret these specific numbers that come out of trials. They are highly effective vaccines, they are life-saving vaccines, they are safe vaccines and we should get on with deploying them,” O’Brien told a news conference.
“So anybody who is offered vaccine should take whatever is being offered by the program and ensure that the vaccines that are being produced, are used to their maximum benefit,” she said.",Reuters,"Mar 17, 2021 10:44 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-vaccination-pregnant-women-could-protect-babies-israeli-researchers-say/,"COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant women could protect babies, Israeli researchers say","Pregnant women vaccinated against COVID-19 could pass along protection to their babies, according to a new study in Israel.
According to the research conducted in February, antibodies were detected in all 20 women administered both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine during their third trimester of pregnancy and in their newborns, through placental transfer.
“Our findings highlight that vaccination of pregnant women may provide maternal and neonatal protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection,” the study said.
The findings by researchers from Jerusalem’s Hadassah- University Medical Center were posted this month on medRxiv – an online distribution service for unpublished research manuscripts that have not been peer-reviewed – and reported by Israeli media on Tuesday.
The authors noted the small size of the study and said further research was necessary to gauge the effect of vaccination at different stages of pregnancy, and the safety and efficacy of the different vaccines now available.
One of the researchers, Dana Wolf, was quoted by the Jerusalem Post as saying the group will now start looking at how long the antibodies triggered by the vaccinations will last in the babies.
Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE said last month they had started a 4,000-volunteer international study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of their COVID-19 vaccine in healthy pregnant women.
The trial will also assess whether vaccinated pregnant women transfer protective antibodies to their babies.
A separate US study posted last week and also awaiting peer review, found that the antibodies induced in pregnant women from mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, such as the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna  shots, were transferred to the babies via the placenta or breast milk.",Reuters,"Mar 17, 2021 3:13 PM PHT"

Lorena, a single mother who lives in the southern Chilean city of Puerto Montt, told the TVN network that her music-loving and sociable son died about a week after he first complained of feeling tired and of a pain in his legs in late January.
Within days he had developed livid blotches on his skin, a high fever, vomiting, and dark urine.
Doctors at the city’s hospital, overrun with severe COVID-19 cases, repeatedly tested him for COVID-19, but with the results coming back negative were at a loss as to what was wrong with him.
By the time his illness was identified as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, it was too late. Lorena could not be at her son’s bedside because of strict health protocols, but a social worker called to pass on the message that her son loved her very much. She asked the social worker to tell her son she would see him soon, and that his pets were well.
“A doctor said that if I had faith, I should pray because my son was very ill,” said Navarrete, who works as a nurse technician. “They had a diagnosis and it was PIMS.”
Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), as PIMS is more commonly known, is a rare, life-threatening syndrome linked to COVID-19.
It usually appears between two and six weeks after infection, even in asymptomatic cases of COVID-19.
It shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease, including fever, rashes, swollen glands, conjunctivitis and, in severe cases, heart inflammation, and can cause multiple organ failure. It is not always fatal if caught and treated early.
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in January that it was investigating whether COVID-19 variants were increasing the number or severity of cases following anecdotal reports from some states.
Dr. Loreto Twele, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Puerto Montt hospital, said catching it was like piecing together a jigsaw.
“There is no single exam. You have to put the pieces together to be able to make an early diagnosis and start treatment,” she said.
Chilean public health chief Paula Daza said in a media briefing on Monday that of the 69,563 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children so far in Chile, 157 cases of MIS-C have been reported.
“The rate of cases of children with these conditions is quite low, however, health professionals have to be alert,” she said. For Emilio’s mother Lorena, the pain of losing her only son is partly helped by knowing she can raise awareness.
“I do not want Emilio’s death to be in vain and for this to be known so that the same thing does not happen to other parents,” she said.",Reuters,"Mar 17, 2021 10:21 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-urges-health-workers-allow-lifesaving-mother-baby-contact/,WHO urges health workers to allow lifesaving mother-baby contact,"The COVID-19 pandemic is severely affecting the care of sick or premature newborn babies, with many being unnecessarily separated from their mothers and put at risk of death or long-term health problems, global health experts said on Tuesday, March 16.
Two new studies cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that thousands of neonatal healthcare workers are not allowing mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections to have skin-to-skin contact with their newborns, and nearly a quarter of those surveyed are not allowing breastfeeding.
Yet keeping mothers and babies together and encouraging all babies to have so-called “kangaroo mother care” – which involves early and very close contact between a mother and a newborn – could save more than 125,000 lives, according to a study published in the Lancet EclinicalMedicine journal.
Newborn babies all over the world have “a right to the life-saving contact they need with their parents,” and this should not be denied due to the COVID-19 pandemic, said Anshu Banerjee, a WHO expert in maternal and newborn health.
“Decades of progress in reducing child deaths will be jeopardized unless we act now,” he said in a statement.
The WHO says mothers should continue to share a room with their babies from birth and be able to breastfeed and have skin-to-skin contact – even when COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed.
But a study in the BMJ Global Health journal found that two-thirds of 1,120 healthcare workers surveyed worldwide said they would separate mothers and babies with a positive COVID-19 test or if it was not clear whether they might have COVID-19.
More than 85% of those surveyed reported fearing for their own health, with personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages, stress, and safety among the key concerns. In some hospitals, the survey found, vital resources including staff and oxygen supplies were being moved from newborn wards to COVID-19 wards.",Reuters,"Mar 16, 2021 7:52 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/regular-booster-vaccines-future-battle-with-covid-19/,Regular booster vaccines are the future in battle with COVID-19 virus,"Regular booster vaccines against the novel coronavirus will be needed because of mutations that make it more transmissible and better able to evade human immunity, the head of Britain’s effort to sequence the virus’s genomes told Reuters.
The novel coronavirus, which has killed 2.65 million people globally since it emerged in China in late 2019, mutates around once every two weeks, slower than influenza or HIV, but enough to require tweaks to vaccines.
Sharon Peacock, who heads COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) which has sequenced half of all the novel coronavirus genomes so far mapped globally, said international cooperation was needed in the “cat and mouse” battle with the virus.
“We have to appreciate that we were always going to have to have booster doses; immunity to coronavirus doesn’t last forever,” Peacock told Reuters at the Wellcome Sanger Institute’s 55-acre campus outside Cambridge.
“We already are tweaking the vaccines to deal with what the virus is doing in terms of evolution – so there are variants arising that have a combination of increased transmissibility and an ability to partially evade our immune response,” she said.
Peacock said she was confident regular booster shots – such as for influenza – would be needed to deal with future variants but that the speed of vaccine innovation meant those shots could be developed at pace and rolled out to the population.
COG-UK was set up by Peacock, a professor at Cambridge, exactly a year ago with the help of the British’s government’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, as the virus spread across the globe to Britain.
It is now the world’s biggest network of knowledge about the virus’s genetics: At sites across Britain, it has sequenced 346,713 genomes of the virus out of a global effort of around 709,000 genomes.
On the intellectual frontline at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, hundreds of scientists – many with PhDs, many working on a voluntary basis and some listening to heavy metal or electronic beats – work seven days a week to map and then search the virus’s growing family tree for patterns of concern.
Wellcome Sanger Institute has sequenced over half of the UK total sequenced genomes of the virus after processing 19 million samples from PCR tests in a year. COG-UK is sequencing around 30,000 genomes per week – more than the UK used to do in a year.",Reuters,"Mar 15, 2021 4:08 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/coronavirus-year-countries-got-it-right-wrong/,"Coronavirus 1 year on: 2 countries that got it right, and 3 that got it wrong","On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the COVID-19 public health emergency had become a pandemic: 114 countries were affected, there were 121,500 confirmed cases, and more than 4,000 people had succumbed to the virus.
One year on, we have now seen 115 million confirmed cases globally and more than 2.5 million deaths from COVID-19.
“Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly,” said the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on that day in 2020. But in the year since that announcement, the fates of many countries have depended on how leaders have chosen their words.
The impact of the pandemic was unprecedented and all governments faced challenges dealing with a severe but highly unpredictable threat to the lives of their citizens. And some governments responded better than others.
My colleagues and I recently carried out a comparative study of how 27 countries responded to the emergence of the virus and first wave, and how they communicated that response to their citizens.
We invited national experts to analyze their government’s communication style, the flow of information on coronavirus, and the actions taken by civil society, mapping these responses onto the numbers of cases and deaths in the country in question. Our work reveals contrasting responses that reflect a nation’s internal politics, suggesting that a government’s handling of the pandemic was embedded in existing patterns of leadership.
With news of the spread of COVID-19 flowing across international borders, domestic preventative measures needed to be explained carefully. The WHO proved ill-equipped, provided equivocal and flawed advice regarding international travel, even from Hubei province, and equivocated on the efficacy of wearing masks. So much came down to how individual leaders communicated with their citizens about the risks they faced.
Experts in crisis management and social psychologists emphasize the importance of clarity and empathy in communicating during a health emergency.
So who did well and who missed the mark?
We found two major examples of this style of communication working well in practice. South Korea avoided a lockdown due to clearly communicating the threat of COVID-19 as early as January, encouraging the wearing of masks (which were common previously within the nation in response to an earlier SARS epidemic), and quickly rolling out a contact-tracing app.
Each change in official alert level, accompanied by new advice regarding social contact, was carefully communicated by Jung Eun-Kyung, the head of the country’s Center for Disease Control, who used changes in her own life to demonstrate how new guidance should work in practice.
The transparency of this approach was echoed in the communication style of the Ghanaian president, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.
Akufo-Addo took responsibility for coronavirus policy and explained carefully each measure required, being honest about the challenges the nation faced. Simple demonstrations of empathy earned him acclaim within his nation and also around the world.
“We know how to bring the economy back to life. What we don’t know is how to bring people back to life,” he famously said.
South Korea and Ghana adopted a consistent tone highlighting the risks of the new pandemic and how they could be mitigated. Nations that fared less well encouraged complacency and gave out inconsistent messages about the threat of COVID-19.
In March 2020, just three weeks prior to placing the country under lockdown and catching COVID-19 himself, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson downplayed the threat, and said he had been shaking hands with infected people, against the recommendations of his expert advisers. Today, the UK has one of the highest per capita death rates from COVID in the world.
Avoiding a full initial lockdown, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro – who also contracted COVID-19 – called for normality to continue, challenging expert guidance and polarising opinion along partisan lines. Such practices led Brazilians to mistrust the official information and spread of misinformation, while adhering to containment measures became an ideological, rather than a public health, question.
Meanwhile, Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, announced a snap lockdown with just four hours notice, which caused an internal migration crisis, with poor laborers leaving cities to walk hundreds or thousands of miles to their rural homes. Understandably, the laborers prioritized their fears of homelessness and starvation over the risk of spreading COVID-19 around the country.
None of these responses effectively considered the impact that coronavirus would have on society, or that credibility is earned through consistency. The poor outcomes in each case are a partial reflection of these leadership mistakes.
Of course, the unfolding of the pandemic was not solely down to good or bad communication from leaders. Health systems and demographics may also have played a role, and the worst impacted nations not only had strategic weaknesses but are also global transport hubs and popular destinations – London, New York, Paris, and so on. With hindsight, closing borders would have been wise, despite the contrary advice from the World Health Organization.
Still, it’s evident that leaders who adopted clear, early, expert-led, coherent and empathic guidance fared well in terms of their standing with the public and were able to mitigate the worst effects of the virus.
On the other hand, those who politicized the virus, exhibited unrestrained optimism, or took to last-minute decision-making oversaw some of the nations with the most cases and deaths. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/astrazeneca-finds-no-evidence-increased-blood-clot-risk-vaccine/,AstraZeneca finds no evidence of increased blood clot risk from vaccine,"AstraZeneca Plc said on Sunday, March 14, a review of safety data of people vaccinated with its COVID-19 vaccine has shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.
AstraZeneca’s review, which covered more than 17 million people vaccinated in the United Kingdom and European Union, comes after health authorities in some countries suspended the use of its vaccine over clotting issues.
“A careful review of all available safety data of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the European Union and UK with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or thrombocytopenia, in any defined age group, gender, batch, or in any particular country,” the company said.
Authorities in Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and the Netherlands have suspended the use of the vaccine over clotting issues, while Austria stopped using a batch of AstraZeneca shots last week while investigating a death from coagulation disorders.
“It is most regrettable that countries have stopped vaccination on such ‘precautionary’ grounds: it risks doing real harm to the goal of vaccinating enough people to slow the spread of the virus, and to end the pandemic,” Peter English, a retired British government consultant in communicable disease control, told Reuters.
European Medicines Agency has said there is no indication that the events were caused by the vaccination, a view that was echoed by the World Health Organization on Friday.
The drugmaker said 15 events of deep vein thrombosis and 22 events of pulmonary embolism have been reported so far, which is similar across other licensed COVID-19 vaccines.
The company said additional testing has and is being conducted by the company and the European health authorities and none of the re-tests have shown cause for concern. The monthly safety report will be made public on the EMA website in the following week, AstraZeneca said.
The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed in collaboration with Oxford University, has been authorized for use in the European Union and many countries but not yet by US regulators.

https://www.rappler.com/environment/nature/sea-slugs-lose-heads-rid-bodies-parasites-japan-researchers-show/,"Sea slugs lose heads to rid bodies of parasites, Japan researchers show","Japanese researchers have shown that a type of sea slug are able to self-decapitate and regrow their bodies, a discovery that could have ramifications for regenerative medicine.
The mechanism is believed to be an extreme method for the organism to rid itself of parasites, researchers Sayaka Mitoh and Yoichi Yusa wrote in a study published in Current Biology this week. The green slugs have algae cells in their skin, so they can feed off light like a plant until they develop a new body, which takes about 20 days.
Mitoh, a doctoral researcher at Nara Women’s University, noticed one day that a sea slug, known as a sacoglossan, had spontaneously detached its head from its body.
“I was surprised and thought it was going to die, but it continued to move around and eat quite energetically,” Mitoh said. “I kept an eye on it for a while, and it regenerated its heart and body.”
That prompted a study showing that 5 of 15 lab-bred slugs and one from the wild split its body off from a particular point on the neck during their lives. One did so twice. Each time, the animal’s heart was left behind in the body, which continued to live for some time, but didn’t regrow a head.
“One of the amazing things about stem cells is that they can be used to regenerate a heart and body from the edge of the animal’s head,” Mitoh said. “With further study, we may be able to apply these findings to regenerative medicine, but that’s still a distant hope at this stage.”
Other animals have been known to intentionally detach and regrow body parts, a mechanism known as autotomy, but this extreme form was previously unknown, the researchers said.
They initially thought it might be a method to escape predators, but they now think it’s done to get rid of parasites that inhibit reproduction.",Reuters,"Mar 12, 2021 3:55 PM PHT"

In a health ministry news conference, Prasit Watanapa, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Siriraj Hospital, confirmed the rollout would be delayed after a suspension of inoculations using the vaccine in Denmark, Norway and Iceland.
Thailand was in a position to suspend the rollout for safety investigations because it had brought under control a second wave of coronavirus cases, said Kiattiphum Wongjit, permanent secretary for the Public Health Ministry.
“AstraZeneca is still a good vaccine but with what has happened … the health ministry based on this advice would like to postpone the usage of the AstraZeneca vaccine momentarily,” Kiattiphum said.
Yong Poonvorawan, a virology expert, told the news conference that the investigation would also check on whether any issues might be related to particular batches in Europe and said the vaccines supplied to Thailand were made in Asia.
Thailand has so far recorded just over 26,500 coronavirus infections and 85 fatalities in a population of 66.5 million. A second wave that began in December is now registering below 100 new infections per day.
Thailand’s overall vaccination strategy is heavily reliant on AstraZeneca, which will be produced locally by a company owned by the country’s king, with 61 million doses reserved for the Thai population.
However, the locally made AstraZeneca is not due to be ready until at least June, and Thailand last week began limited inoculations with imported doses of the Sinovac vaccine.
Thailand has so far administered about 40,000 of the 200,000 recently received doses of Sinovac’s CoronaVac, Kiattiphum said.
The country also last week received 117,300 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which the prime minister and his cabinet had been scheduled to receive on Friday.
Kiattiphum said that Thailand’s imported doses were not from the same batch that is being investigated in Europe.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/contraceptive-cost-covid-19-million-unplanned-pregnancies/,Contraceptive cost of COVID-19: A million unplanned pregnancies,"Nearly 12 million women in poorer countries lost access to contraception in the pandemic, leading to 1.4 million unplanned pregnancies, the United Nations said on Thursday, March 11.
Estimates by the UN sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA, showed women lost access to contraception as the pandemic drew resources away from family planning or hit supply chains.
Women also lost out due to coronavirus travel restrictions, clinic closures, and stay-at-home orders, the UNFPA said.
“We must ensure that women and girls have uninterrupted access to life-saving contraceptives and maternal health medicines,” UNFPA’s head, Natalia Kanem, said in a statement.
“The devastating impact that COVID-19 has had on the lives of millions of women and girls in the past year underscores just how vital it is to ensure the continuity of reproductive health services.”
The UN data highlighted the many ways in which women have suffered disproportionately in the pandemic, be it through greater job losses, increased domestic duties, or rising incidents of domestic and sexual violence.
In 115 low- and middle-income countries, women faced an average disruption in their family planning services of 3.6 months over the past year, UNFPA data showed.
The UN said this showed how “many health systems were resilient enough to eventually adapt” and return to business sooner than it had expected.
Last April, it had predicted that 47 million women would be affected by disruptions in family planning services, resulting in 7 million unintended pregnancies.
The data is nonetheless “incredibly concerning,” said Paula Avila-Guillen, head of the Women’s Equality Center, a US-based health care and rights organization.
Lockdowns and school closures have also kept many girls and women confined to home with abusive family members, she said, leading to “more insidious and more invisible consequences.”
“Many violence victims rely on access to birth control and are becoming pregnant as a result of this violence, which chains them even more to their abusers’ control,” she said.
The disruption also badly affects women living in countries where abortion is banned or severely restricted, including in parts of Latin America and Africa.
“When people lose access to contraception, they are left to try and make do with often less effective ways to avoid a pregnancy they do not want,” said Ann Biddlecom, director of international research at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research group.
“For people in many countries who experience an unintended pregnancy, they face further barriers to being able to secure a safe abortion.”",Thomson Reuters Foundation,"Mar 12, 2021 9:55 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/novavax-vaccine-efficacy-march-12-2021/,"Novavax 96% effective vs original coronavirus, 86% vs British variant in UK trial","Novavax Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine was 96% effective in preventing cases caused by the original version of the coronavirus in a late-stage trial conducted in the United Kingdom, the company said on Thursday, March 11, moving it a step closer to regulatory approval.
There were no cases of severe illness or deaths among those who got the vaccine, the company said, in a sign that it could stop the worse effects of new variants that have cropped up.
The vaccine was 86% effective in protecting against the more contagious virus variant first discovered and now prevalent in the United Kingdom, for a combined 90% effectiveness rate overall based on data from infections of both versions of the coronavirus.
Novavax shares jumped 22% in after-hours trading to $229. They were trading below $10 on January 21, 2020, when the company announced it was developing a coronavirus vaccine.
In a smaller trial conducted in South Africa – where volunteers were primarily exposed to another newer, more contagious variant widely circulating there and spreading around the world – the Novavax vaccine was 55% effective, based on people without HIV, but still fully prevented severe illness.
Novavax Chief Medical Officer Filip Dubovsky said the performance in South Africa suggests there may still be a case for using it in areas where the South African variant is dominant.
Novavax is also developing new formulations of its vaccine to protect against emerging variants and plans to initiate clinical testing of these shots in the second quarter of this year.
Results from the final analysis of the UK trial were largely in line with interim data released in January.
The company expects to use the data to submit for regulatory authorization in various countries. It is not clear when it will seek US authorization or if regulators will require it to complete an ongoing trial in the United States.
Novavax expects data from a 30,000-person trial in the United States and Mexico by early April.
Dubovsky said that Novavax is still planning to file for authorization from UK regulators early in the second quarter of 2021.
The UK trial, which enrolled more than 15,000 people aged 18 to 84, assessed efficacy of the vaccine during a period with high transmission of the UK virus variant now circulating widely.
The shot’s effectiveness in the South Africa trial declined to around 49% when the analysis included data from HIV-positive participants.
The vaccine could be cleared for use in the United States as soon as May if US regulators decide the UK data is enough to make a decision. It could take a couple months longer if they insist on first seeing data from the US trial, its chief executive told Reuters earlier this month.
“Ultimately, they have to decide whether the data we can bring to the table is adequate or whether they would prefer to wait on data from our US study,” Dubovsky said on Thursday.
Novavax’s vaccine production plants should all be fully functional by April, executives said on a March investor call. The drugmaker expects to have tens of millions of doses stockpiled and ready to ship in the United States when it receives authorization, CEO Stanley Erck told Reuters.
Novavax plans to produce its two-shot vaccine at eight manufacturing locations, including the Serum Institute of India.
If authorized, it would follow three COVID-19 vaccines previously approved for use in Britain from Pfizer and partner BioNTech, Moderna Inc, and the AstraZeneca shot developed with Oxford University.
The Maryland-based company has received $1.6 billion from the U.S. government in funding for the vaccine trial and to secure 100 million doses.",Reuters,"Mar 12, 2021 8:42 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/expert-covid-19-variant-taking-over-uk-likely-dominate-elsewhere/,COVID-19 variant ‘taking over’ UK and likely to dominate elsewhere – expert,"A coronavirus variant first found a few months ago in Britain is now “taking over” and causing 98% of all cases in the UK, the scientist leading the country’s variant-tracking research said on Thursday, March 11.
Sharon Peacock said the UK variant, known as B117, also appears to be gaining a firm grip in many of the 100 or so other countries it has spread to in the past few months.
“It’s around 50% more transmissible – hence its success in really taking over the country,” said Peacock, director of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium of scientists monitoring mutations in the coronavirus.
“We now know that it has spread across the UK and causes nearly all of the cases of COVID-19 – about 98%,” she told an online briefing for Britain’s Royal Society of Medicine.
“It appears to be the case that the other variants are not getting a foothold in this country.”
The B117 variant, first detected in September 2020, has 23 mutations in its genetic code – a relatively high number of changes – and is thought by experts to be 40%-70% more transmissible than previously dominant variants.
Peacock also noted data released on Wednesday, March 10, from a UK study which found that B117 has “significantly higher” mortality, with death rates among those infected with it between 30% and 100% greater than among those infected with previous variants.
“There is a small increase in the likelihood of death from the variant,” she said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said B117 is one of several “variants of concern,” along with others that have emerged in South Africa and Brazil. The variants are mutant versions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, which has already killed more than 2.7 million people in the pandemic.
B117 has spread to about 100 countries, according to WHO data, and some of those, including France, Denmark and the United States, have reported swift rises in the proportion of their COVID-19 cases being caused it.
Peacock said evidence from the UK suggests B117 is likely to become dominant elsewhere too.
“Because of its transmissibility, once it’s introduced, it does have that advantage over other circulating variants – so it is the case that B117 appears to be traveling around the world and really expanding where it lands.”

Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter will star in two new public service announcements (PSA) for the coronavirus vaccine alongside former first ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton and Rosalynn Carter, the Ad Council announced on Thursday.
“The science is clear. These vaccines will protect you and those you love from this dangerous and deadly disease,” said President Bush in one of the PSAs with Obama and Clinton, urging Americans to get vaccinated.
“That’s the first step to ending the pandemic and moving our country forward,” said Obama.
Noticeably absent in the vaccine PSAs, created by nonprofit the Ad Council, are former president Donald Trump and Melania Trump. During his run for re-election last year, Trump widely touted his administration’s role in bringing a vaccine to market.
When asked about Trump’s absence, a spokesman for the Ad Council said one of the PSAs was filmed at President Joe Biden’s inauguration in January, which Trump did not attend.
The spokesman added the organization was pleased when Trump recently advised Americans to “go get your shot” after receiving the vaccine.
The new ads are part of the Ad Council’s nationwide vaccine education campaign titled “It’s Up To You.” More than 300 partners are supporting the nonprofit in the effort to battle hesitancy about the vaccine’s safety and help convince more people to get the shot.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/year-into-pandemic-coronavirus-messing-with-our-minds-our-bodies/,"A year into the pandemic, the coronavirus is messing with our minds as well as our bodies","COVID-19 has hijacked people’s lives, families and work. And, it has hijacked their bodies and minds in ways that they may not even be aware of.
As we see it, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a sort of zombie virus, turning people not into the undead but rather into the unsick. By interfering with our bodies’ normal immune response and blocking pain, the virus keeps the infected on their feet, spreading the virus.
People typically think of zombies as the stuff of science fiction. But in the biological world, zombies are all over the place, from the Ophiocordyceps fungus that perpetuates itself by zombifying ants; to Toxoplasma gondii, a single-celled parasite that completes its life cycle by leading rodents into the jaws of predators. Zombie viruses are also a real thing, influencing their host’s behavior in ways that enhance the viruses’ evolutionary fitness.
One of us is a professor of psychology. The other is an emergency physician. Both of us are evolutionary medicine researchers. And we suggest to you that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is yet another zombie virus, a master manipulator operating under the radar. This pandemic may have unleashed a horde of the unsick: infected and unwitting victims of a manipulative virus.
It is the unsick who spread the virus most readily. About 40% of those with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic spreaders, never showing symptoms at all. And those who do show symptoms are most contagious in the two days before symptoms appear. Why people don’t feel sick earlier – or sick at all – might be part of the evolutionary strategy of SARS-CoV-2.
A look under the hood of the virus reveals more about that manipulative machinery. SARS-CoV-2 interferes with a person’s immune response; this is why people don’t necessarily feel sick and withdrawn as they would in a typical viral infection. Instead, SARS-CoV-2 silences the body’s alarm signals that otherwise would orchestrate anti-viral defenses. It blocks interferons, a set of molecules that help fight viruses. Interferon activity makes people feel more depressed and socially withdrawn – so when the novel coronanvirus impedes interferon activity, mood is lifted, sociality is increased and you feel less sick.
The virus also decreases pain perception. Normally, pain motivates us to hunker down when we need to heal. But SARS-CoV-2 blocks this response by preventing the transmission of pain signals. This is why people feel fine even when they are teeming with virus before the onset of symptoms.
At the same time, SARS-CoV-2 dampens the body’s response to infection. It hinders pro-inflammatory cytokines, molecules that help spur the immune response. This too makes hosts feel better than they should. Typically, feeling sick helps our bodies prioritize healing by making us reduce our energy expenditure. With SARS-CoV-2, unsick hosts have the energy to do as much as they used to, maybe more.
How SARS-CoV-2 evolved to manipulate humans is still speculation. The virus could have first evolved in other mammals, like pangolins. There, it may have acquired its immune-evading, manipulative machinery before jumping to humans.
No intent or thought is involved; SARS-CoV-2 is not scheming to take over your body. This is simply evolution at work, nothing personal. The virus evolves because of variation and selection. And in a pandemic involving hundreds of millions of infections and trillions of viral replications, plenty of genetic variants could give it an evolutionary leg up.
More research is needed to determine whether new variants make people feel unsick for longer. That, of course, would make it even easier for the virus spread during the asymptomatic phase. For example, a paper in the Journal of Transnational Medicine reported that the GZ69 variant is associated with high shedding rates in asymptomatic patients, meaning that people are highly contagious even when they are feeling fine.
It’s possible that SARS-CoV-2 might make people feel even better than they would without infection from the virus. One study found people did not reduce their time out in public even when they had COVID-19 symptoms. If anything, they went out more. Any variant that does this clearly has an evolutionary advantage when it comes to transmission. Using surveys and social media data, our research team is now testing whether people are more social during their most infectious days.
We must take seriously the possibility that the virus is zombifying us – altering our behavior in ways that help perpetuate it. By keeping people feeling good when they are capable of spreading the virus, SARS-CoV-2 spreads under the radar, more like a sexually transmitted disease than a respiratory virus.
Many of us have unwittingly acted as vehicles for its propagation, with stunning implications. Our behavior might not be in our own evolutionary interests. Instead, the unsick may be serving the virus.
Researchers often ignore the impact that viruses might have on our moods and behaviors. But like ants and rodents, humans are not exempt from the neural and behavioral hijacking that’s widespread in the natural world.
We believe that it is critical to consider the possible “anti-symptoms” of this virus: temporary reduction in pain, feeling more energetic than normal and perhaps even wanting to be around people more than usual. With all this in mind, here’s some advice, likely the most ironic you’ve heard in the last year: If you’ve been feeling surprisingly good the last few days, you might want to get a COVID-19 test. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

In a study that compared death rates among people in Britain infected with the new SARS-CoV-2 variant, known as B117, against those infected with other strains, scientists said the new variant had “significantly higher” mortality.
The B117 variant was first detected in Britain in September 2020, and has since been found in more than 100 countries.
It has 23 mutations in its genetic code – a relatively high number of changes – and some of these have made it far more able to spread. UK scientists say it is about 40%-70% more transmissible than previously dominant circulating coronavirus variants.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/un-experts-fukushima-radiation-unlikely-raise-cancer-rates/,"Fukushima radiation unlikely to raise cancer rates, UN experts say","A UN scientific panel on Tuesday, March 9, confirmed a previous finding that radiation from the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan was unlikely to raise cancer rates discernibly, and said a jump in thyroid cancer in children was due to “ultrasensitive” screening methods.
Fukushima was the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, the 1986 Soviet reactor explosion that sent radioactive dust across much of Europe. A magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, and more than 160,000 residents had to flee as radiation spewed into the air.
After Chernobyl, people living close to the plant were exposed to radioactive iodine through contaminated milk. The Japanese authorities took more effective action including evacuations that significantly reduced exposure.
Two days before the 10th anniversary of the disaster, the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), which comprises 52 scientists from 27 countries, published an update to a 2014 report, based on data up to the end of 2019.
“The updated (radiation) dose estimates to members of the public have either decreased or are comparable with the Scientific Committee’s previous estimates,” UNSCEAR said in a statement.
“The Committee therefore continues to consider that future health effects directly related to radiation exposure are unlikely to be discernible.”
There has, however, been an increase in thyroid cancers in children.
The thyroid – a gland in the neck that produces hormones – is the most exposed organ as radioactive iodine concentrates there. Children are especially vulnerable.
In a first round between 2011 and 2015, more than 300,000 people aged 18 and under in the Fukushima area were screened for thyroid cancer using highly sensitive ultrasound equipment, UNSCEAR said, revealing 116 cases of actual or suspected cancer.
A study using equivalent equipment in three prefectures not exposed to radiation from Fukushima found rates of thyroid cysts and nodules – possible indications of cancer – as high as those in the Fukushima screening, UNSCEAR added.
“On the balance of available evidence, the large increase…in the number of thyroid cancers detected among exposed children is not the result of radiation exposure,” UNSCEAR said.
“Rather, they are the result of ultrasensitive screening procedures that have revealed the prevalence of thyroid abnormalities in the population not previously detected.”",Reuters,"Mar 9, 2021 9:22 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/spot-someone-mislead-you-science/,5 ways to spot if someone is trying to mislead you when it comes to science,"It’s not a new thing for people to try to mislead you when it comes to science. But in the age of COVID-19 — when we’re being bombarded with even more information than usual, when there’s increased uncertainty, and when we may be feeling overwhelmed and fearful — we’re perhaps even more susceptible to being deceived.
The challenge is to be able to identify when this may be happening. Sometimes it’s easy, as often even the most basic fact-checking and logic can be potent weapons against misinformation.
But often, it can be hard. People who are trying either to make you believe something that isn’t true, or to doubt something that is true, use a variety of strategies that can manipulate you very effectively.
Here are five to look out for.
This is one of the most common tactics used to mislead. It taps into our intrinsic distrust of authority and paints those with evidence-based views as part of some other group that’s not be trusted. This other group — whether people or an institution — is supposedly working together against the common good, and may even want to harm us.
Recently we’ve seen federal MP Craig Kelly use this device. He has repeatedly referred to “big goverment” being behind a conspiracy to withhold hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin from the public (these drugs currently don’t have proven benefits against COVID-19). Kelly is suggesting there are forces working to prevent doctors from prescribing these drugs to treat COVID-19, and that he’s on our side.
His assertion is designed to distract from, or completely dismiss, what the scientific evidence is telling us. It’s targeted at people who feel disenfranchised and are predisposed to believing these types of claims.
Although this is one of the least sophisticated strategies used to mislead, and easy to spot, it can be very effective.
People tend to use the phrase “I’m not a scientist, but…” as a sort of universal disclaimer which they feel allows them to say whatever they want, regardless of scientific accuracy.
A phrase with similar intent is “I know what the science says, but I’m keeping an open mind.” People who want to disregard what the evidence is showing, but at the same time want to appear reasonable and credible, often use these phrases.
Politicians are among the most frequent offenders. On an episode of Q&A in 2020, Senator Jim Molan indicated he was not “relying on the evidence” to form his conclusions about whether climate change was caused by humans. He was keeping an open mind, he said.
If you hear any statements that sound faintly like these ones, particularly from a politician, alarm bells should ring very loudly.
This is perhaps one of the most powerful strategies used to mislead.
There are of course times when the science is not settled, and when this is the case, scientists openly argue different points of view based on the evidence available.
Currently, experts are having an important debate around the role of tiny airborne particles called aerosols in the transmission of COVID-19. As for most things COVID-related, we’re working with limited and uncertain evidence, and the landscape is in constant flux. This type of debate is healthy.
But people might suggest the science isn’t settled in a mischievous way, to overstate the degree of uncertainty in an area. This strategy exploits the broader community’s limited understanding of the scientific process, including the fact all scientific findings are associated with a degree of uncertainty.
It’s well documented the tobacco industry designed the playbook on this to dismiss the evidence that smoking causes lung cancer.
The goal here is to raise doubt, create confusion and undermine the science. The power in this strategy lies in the fact it’s relatively easy to employ — particularly in today’s digital age.
Oversimplifications and generalizations are where many conspiracy theories are born.
Science is often messy, complex, and full of nuance. The truth can be much harder to explain, and can sometimes sound less plausible, than a simple but incorrect explanation.
We’re naturally drawn to simple explanations. And if they tap into our fears and exploit our cognitive biases — systematic errors we make when we interpret information — they can be extremely seductive.
Conspiracy theories, such as the one suggesting 5G is the cause of COVID-19, take off because they offer a simple explanation for something frightening and complex. This particular claim also feeds into concerns some people may have about new technologies.
As a general rule, when something appears too good or too bad to be true, it usually is.
People who use this approach treat scientific studies like individual chocolates in a gift box, where you can choose the ones you like and disregard the ones you don’t. Of course, this isn’t how science works.
It’s important to understand not all studies are equal; some provide much stronger evidence than others. You can’t just conveniently put all your faith in the studies that align with your views, and ignore those that don’t.
When scientists evaluate evidence, they go through a systematic process to assess the whole body of evidence. This is a crucial task that requires expertise.
The cherry-picking tactic can be hard to counter because unless you’re across all the evidence, you’re not likely to know whether the studies being presented have been deliberately curated to mislead you.
This is yet another reason to rely on the experts who understand the full breadth of the evidence and can interpret it sensibly.
The pandemic has highlighted the speed at which misinformation can travel, and how dangerous this can be. Regardless of how sensible or educated we think we are, we can all be taken in by people trying to mislead us.
The key to preventing this is to understand some of the common tactics used to mislead, so we’ll be better placed to spot them, and this may prompt us to seek out more reliable sources of information. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

The emergence of variants of the new coronavirus has raised concern that vaccines and treatments that were developed based on previous strains may not work as robustly.
Plasma samples taken from 8 people vaccinated with Sinovac’s CoronaVac failed to efficiently neutralize the P.1 lineage variant, or 20J/501Y.V3, researchers said in a paper published on Monday, March 1, ahead of peer-review.
“These results suggest that P.1 virus might escape from neutralizing antibodies induced by… CoronaVac,” researchers at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, Washington University School of Medicine in the United States, and a few other institutions said in the paper.
CoronaVac is being used in mass vaccination drives in countries including China, Brazil, Indonesia, the Philipines, and Turkey.
Although the study suggests re-infection may occur in vaccinated individuals, the protection given by CoronaVac against severe COVID-19 may indicate other mechanisms in the human immune system, aside from antibodies, may also contribute to reducing disease severity, researchers said.
A Sinovac spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Chief executive Yin Weidong said in a program aired by state-backed broadcaster CGTN on Thursday, March 4, the company is “fully capable” of using current research and manufacturing capacity to develop a new vaccine against variants if necessary.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/japan-supercomputer-shows-double-masks-offers-little-help-preventing-viral-spread/,Japan supercomputer shows double masks offer little help preventing viral spread,"Japanese supercomputer simulations showed that wearing two masks gave limited benefit in blocking viral spread compared with one properly fitted mask.
The findings in part contradict recent recommendations from the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that two masks were better than one at reducing a person’s exposure to the coronavirus.
Researchers used the Fugaku supercomputer to model the flow of virus particles from people wearing different types and combinations of masks, according to a study released on Thursday, March 4, by research giant Riken and Kobe University.
Using a single surgical-type mask, made of non-woven material, had 85% effectiveness in blocking particles when worn tightly around the nose and face. Adding a polyurethane mask on top boosted the effectiveness to just 89%.
Wearing two non-woven masks isn’t useful because air resistance builds up and causes leakage around the edges.
“The performance of double masking simply does not add up,” wrote the researchers, led by Makoto Tsubokura.
In general, professional grade N95 masks were the best in protecting against infection, followed by non-woven masks, cloth masks, and finally polyurethane types, the study showed.
The Riken research team previously used the Fugaku supercomputer to model how humidity can affect viral contagion and the infection risks in trains, work spaces, and other environments.
As the COVID-19 epidemic has worn on, scientific consensus has grown that the virus is spread through the air and masks are effective in controlling contagion.",Reuters,"Mar 5, 2021 2:01 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/obesity-driving-factor-covid-19-deaths-global-report/,"Obesity a driving factor in COVID-19 deaths, global report finds","The majority of global COVID-19 deaths have been in countries where many people are obese, with coronavirus fatality rates 10 times higher in nations where at least 50% of adults are overweight, a global study found on Thursday, March 4.
The report, which described a “dramatic” correlation between countries’ COVID-19 death and obesity rates, found that 90% or 2.2 million of the 2.5 million deaths from the pandemic disease so far were in countries with high levels of obesity.
The study analyzed the COVID-19 death figures from Johns Hopkins University in the United States and the World Health Organization’s Global Health Observatory data on obesity.
Strikingly, the authors said, there is no example of a country where people are generally not overweight or obese having high COVID-19 death rates.
“Look at countries like Japan and South Korea, where they have very low levels of COVID-19 deaths as well as very low levels of adult obesity,” said Tim Lobstein, an expert advisor to the World Obesity Federation and visiting professor at Australia’s Sydney University who co-led the report.
“They have prioritized public health across a range of measures, including population weight, and it has paid off in the pandemic.”
By contrast, the report found that in the United States and Britain, for example, both COVID-19 death rates and obesity levels were among the highest.
The United Kingdom has the world’s third-highest coronavirus death rate and the fourth-highest obesity rate – 184 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 and 63.7% of adults overweight, according to WHO data – followed by the United States, with 152.49 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 and 67.9% of adults overweight.
John Wilding, a professor of medicine at Britain’s University of Liverpool and president of the World Obesity Federation, said obesity should be recognized as a key COVID-19 health risk and taken into account in vaccination plans.
“It’s really important that we recognize that obesity…increases the risk,” he said in a statement about the report’s findings. “Therefore, like other diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, people with obesity should be considered for early priority in vaccination programs across the world.”",Reuters,"Mar 4, 2021 11:49 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/south-central-asia/efficacy-data-for-india-covid-19-vaccine-could-boost-public-acceptance/,Efficacy data for India’s COVID-19 vaccine could boost public acceptance,"Indian doctors and politicians on Thursday, March 4, welcomed efficacy data for a state-backed coronavirus vaccine that was given  emergency approval in January without the completion of a late-stage trial, making people reluctant to receive the shot.
Government data shows that only 10% of about 12.6 million people immunized in India have taken the COVAXIN shot, which was found to be 81% effective in an interim analysis of the late-stage trial, its developer Bharat Biotech said on Wednesday, March 3.
Any boost to the vaccine’s acceptance in India, which on Thursday reported a new COVID-19 cases at their highest in 5 weeks, could also brighten its export prospects. Bharat Biotech said 40 countries were interested in COVAXIN.
Many Indian doctors and opposition politicians had rejected COVAXIN because it was approved by the drug regulator only on the basis of data from intermediate trials. The regulator has also authorized the use of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, marketed as Covishield in India, which was found to be 70.42% effective based on overseas trials.
“Now that interim Phase 3 data are available for COVAXIN, I can safely ask my father, who is more than 60 years of age and a diabetic, to get it,” said Nirmalya Mohapatra, a leader of an association of doctors at New Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, having previously publicly refused to take COVAXIN.
Rajib Dasgupta, chairperson of the Centre of Social Medicine & Community Health at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, said the interim results were encouraging but that a “well-rounded picture” would emerge only after a fuller analysis.
Opposition lawmaker Shashi Tharoor welcomed Bharat Biotech’s announcement.
“For those like me who were concerned that COVAXIN was being deployed before its third phase trials were concluded, this is good news indeed,” he said on Twitter.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/what-happens-simultaneously-infected-two-covid-19-variants/,What happens if you’re simultaneously infected with 2 COVID-19 variants?,"Scientists in Brazil recently reported that two people were simultaneously infected with two different variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This co-infection seemed to have no effect on the severity of patients’ illness, and both recovered without needing to be hospitalized.
Although this is one of the few such cases recorded with SARS-CoV-2 – and the study is yet to be published in a scientific journal – scientists have observed infections with multiple strains with other respiratory viruses, such as influenza. This has raised questions about how these viruses may interact in an infected person, and what it could mean for generating new variants.
Viruses are masters of evolution, constantly mutating and creating new variants with every cycle of replication. Selective pressures in the host, such as our immune response, also drive these adaptations. Most of these mutations won’t have a significant effect on the virus. But ones that give an advantage to the virus – for example, by increasing its ability to replicate or evade the immune system – are cause for concern and need to be closely monitored.
The occurrence of these mutations is down to the error-prone replication machinery that viruses use. RNA viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, generate a relatively large number of errors each time they replicate. This creates a “quasi-species” of the virus population, rather like a swarm of viruses, each with related but non-identical sequences. Interactions with the host cells and immune system determine the relative frequencies of the individual variants, and these coexisting variants may affect how the disease progresses or how well treatments work.
Compared with other RNA viruses, coronaviruses have lower mutation rates. This is because they are equipped with a proofreading mechanism that can correct some of the errors that occur during replication. Still, there is evidence of viral genetic diversity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
The detection of multiple variants in a person could be the result of co-infection by the different variants, or the generation of mutations within the patient after the initial infection. One way to discriminate these two scenarios is by comparing the sequences of the variants circulating in the population with those in the patient. In the Brazilian study mentioned above, the variants identified corresponded to different lineages that had been previously detected in the population, implying co-infection by the two variants.
This co-infection has opened concerns of SARS-CoV-2 acquiring new mutations even more rapidly. This is because coronaviruses can also undergo large changes in their genetic sequence by a process called recombination. When two viruses infect the same cell, they can swap large parts of their genomes with each other and create completely new sequences.
This is a known phenomenon in RNA viruses. New variants of influenza are generated by a similar mechanism called “reassortment.” The genome of influenza virus, unlike coronavirus, comprises eight segments or strands of RNA. When two viruses infect the same cell, these segments mix and match to produce viruses with a new combination of genes. Interestingly, pigs can be infected with different strains of influenza viruses, and have been referred to as “mixing vessels” that shuffle them into new strains. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus emerged from a reassortment of a human, avian, and two swine influenza viruses.
With coronaviruses, which only contain one RNA strand in each virus particle, recombination can only occur between RNA strands derived from one or more viruses in the same cell. Evidence of recombination has been found both in the laboratory and in a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that this could drive the generation of new variants. In fact, the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells is proposed to have developed via recombination of the spike protein between closely related animal coronaviruses.
It is important to note that this requires the two viruses to infect the same cell. Even if a person is infected with several variants, if they replicate in different parts of the body, they will not interact with each other. Indeed, this was seen in patients, where different quasi-species of coronaviruses were found in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, suggesting that viruses in these sites were not directly mixing with each other.
The evidence so far does not suggest that infection with more than one variant leads to more severe disease. And although possible, very few cases of co-infection have been reported. More than 90% of the infections in the UK currently are by B117 – the so-called Kent variant. With such a high prevalence of one variant in the population, co-infections are not likely to occur. Still, monitoring this landscape allows scientists to track the emergence of these new variants of concern and understand and respond to any changes in their transmission or vaccine efficacy. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/bharat-biotech-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-march-2021/,"Bharat Biotech’s COVID-19 shot 81% effective, Indian firm’s interim data shows","Bharat Biotech’s vaccine showed 81% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in an interim analysis of a late-stage trial in India, it said on Wednesday, March 3, a major boost for the shot shunned by some due to a lack of such data.
The positive result also brightens prospects for sales overseas, with the vaccine, India’s first successful homemade COVID-19 shot, already attracting interest from more than 40 countries, according to the firm.
“COVAXIN demonstrates high clinical efficacy trend against COVID-19 but also significant immunogenicity against the rapidly emerging variants,” Bharat Biotech Chairman Krishna Ella said in a statement, referring to its vaccine.
It said the analysis is based on 43 cases of COVID-19 patients who showed symptoms ranging from mild to moderate and severe, and of the total cases, 36 were from a placebo group, while seven were from those who received the vaccine.
The results come as India struggles to convince its health and front-line workers to take the Bharat Biotech shot, which was approved in January without late-stage efficacy data.
Only about 11% of the more than 10 million Indians vaccinated had taken the Bharat Biotech shot as of last week, Reuters had reported.
Many politicians in India, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have been inoculated with COVAXIN this week instead of a rival one developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University, as they seek to boost confidence in the locally developed vaccine.
With more than 11 million infections so far, India is battling the world’s largest COVID-19 outbreak outside the United States.
COVAXIN, which can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures, is likely to be effective against the UK strain of the coronavirus, a study said in late January. The shot is an inactivated vaccine that introduces dead virus into the body to trigger an immune response.
Bharat Biotech is based in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, a hub for drug and vaccine makers. It began operations in 1996, and has delivered over 3 billion doses globally of various types of vaccines, including ones for Hepatitis-B and typhoid.
It is aiming to produce about 700 million doses of COVAXIN this year.
The company, which signed a deal with Brazil to supply 20 million doses of the shot, said the next interim analysis will target 87 cases and the final analysis will be based on 130 cases.
Its first interim analysis was based on a Phase III clinical trial involving 25,800 participants which was conducted with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), a federal government body. The trial included 2,433 participants who were older than 60, and 4,500 participants with co-morbidities.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/uk-data-show-covid-19-vaccines-work-march-2021/,"UK data show COVID-19 vaccines work, scientists urge others to take note","British scientists urged European countries to take note on Wednesday, March 3, of interim data showing what they described as “remarkable” effectiveness of a single dose of Pfizer’s or AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccines in frail and elderly people.
The results from a surveillance project called AvonCAP, funded by Pfizer, found that one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca shot was highly effective at preventing symptomatic illness severe enough to lead to hospitalization among patients aged over 80 with multiple other illnesses.
The results add to other early findings from studies of vaccine rollouts in Israel, Scotland and England, which have also pointed to high effectiveness from the first doses.
“Despite the frailty and age of these patients, one dose of either Pfizer or the AstraZeneca vaccine is remarkably effective at reducing hospitalization and serious disease in these individuals,” said Catherine Hyams, a respiratory medicine specialist at Bristol University who co-led the study.
Some European countries, including Germany, Italy and France, are seeing a relatively slow rollout of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine as concerns about its efficacy, coupled with authorities’ recommendations that it be used only with the under-65s, have undermined confidence.
Adam Finn, a professor of pediatrics and the study’s chief investigator, said the results showed Britain’s fast-paced COVID-19 vaccine rollout “is working better than we could have hoped.”
He said health authorities in other countries, where there has been some reticence about deploying the vaccines in elderly people, should recognize and act on these “important” results.
“This study is much more important for non-UK countries than it is for the UK,” he told reporters at a briefing. “There are lots of doses of AstraZeneca vaccine available in European countries and they are not being given to people over the age of 65…for lack of data,” he said.
“Well, here are the data…showing that you can save lives in elderly people,” he added. “And those countries need to get on and start doing that as fast as possible.”
The AvonCap findings showed that a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, which began rollout in Britain on December 8, was 71.4% effective from 14 days at preventing hospitalization among patients with a median age of 87 years, while a single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was rolled out from January 4, was 80.4% effective by the same measures among patients with an average age of 88.",Reuters,"Mar 3, 2021 9:02 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-probes-deaths-who-received-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine/,South Korea probes deaths of 2 who received AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine,"South Korean authorities said on Wednesday, March 3, they are investigating the deaths of two people, both with pre-existing conditions, who died within days of receiving AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine.
A 63-year-old nursing home patient with cerebrovascular disease, developed symptoms including high fever, after being given the vaccine 4 days ago, Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) Director Jeong Eun-kyeong told a briefing.
The man was moved to a larger hospital on Tuesday, March 2, but died after showing symptoms of blood poisoning and pneumonia, Yonhap news agency reported.
Another nursing home patient in his 50s with a cardiac disorder and diabetes died on Wednesday after suffering multiple heart attacks, having received the vaccine a day earlier, the agency said.
KDCA said it is investigating the cause of the deaths, but did not confirm any causal relationship to the vaccine. The agency earlier said it will provide compensation of over 430 million won ($383,466) for deaths from the COVID-19 vaccine.
“KDCA is conducting epidemiological surveys with relevant local authorities… to confirm any link with inoculation,” said Jeong.
An AstraZeneca spokeswoman in Seoul said the company had no comment.
Jeong noted that there were no cases of fatalities from receiving COVID-19 vaccines developed by AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech. However, did urge people to take the shot when they are feeling in good health.
The KDCA said that out of the people who had received the coronavirus vaccines, 207 had adverse reactions, including 3 cases of severe allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis.
South Korea began vaccinating its population last week. By Tuesday midnight, 85,904 people had received the first doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and 1,524 had been given Pfizer shots, KDCA said in a statement.
South Korea reported 444 new confirmed COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, up from 344 on Monday, raising the country’s tally to 90,816 infections, with 1,612 deaths.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/contagious-brazil-covid-19-variant-evades-immunity/,"Contagious Brazil COVID-19 variant evades immunity, scientists warn","A highly transmissible COVID-19 variant that emerged in Brazil and has now been found in at least 20 countries can re-infect people who previously recovered from the disease, scientists said on Tuesday, March 2.
In a study of the mutant virus’s emergence and its spread in the Amazon jungle city of Manaus, the scientists said the variant – known as P.1 – has a “unique constellation of mutations” and had very rapidly become the dominant variant circulating there.
Out of 100 people in Manaus who had previously recovered from infection with the coronavirus, “somewhere between 25 and 61 of them are susceptible to re-infection with P.1,” said Nuno Faria, a virus expert at Imperial College London, who co-led the research which has not yet been peer reviewed.
The scientists estimated that P.1 was 1.4 to 2.2 times more transmissible than the initial form of the virus.
Speaking to a media briefing about the findings, Nuno said it was too early to say whether the variant’s ability to evade immunity from previous infections meant that vaccines also would offer reduced protection against it.
“There’s no concluding evidence really to suggest at this point that the current vaccines won’t work against P.1,” Faria said. “I think (the vaccines) will at least protect us against disease, and possibly also against infection.”
Scientists around the world are on guard against new mutated forms of the coronavirus that could spread more easily, or be harder to fend off with existing vaccines.
The research, conducted with scientists at Brazil’s São Paulo and Britain’s Oxford universities, suggested that the P.1 variant had probably emerged in Manaus in early November 2020.
The first infection with it was identified on December 6, Faria said. “We then looked at how rapidly P.1 overtook other lineages, and we found that the proportion of P.1 grew from zero to 87% in about eight weeks.”",Reuters,"Mar 3, 2021 9:04 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/can-vaccinated-people-still-spread-coronavirus/,Can vaccinated people still spread the coronavirus?,"The short answer is no. You can still get infected after you’ve been vaccinated. But your chances of getting seriously ill are almost zero.
Many people think vaccines work like a shield, blocking a virus from infecting cells altogether. But in most cases, a person who gets vaccinated is protected from disease, not necessarily infection.
Every person’s immune system is a little different, so when a vaccine is 95% effective, that just means 95% of people who receive the vaccine won’t get sick. These people could be completely protected from infection, or they could be getting infected but remain asymptomatic because their immune system eliminates the virus very quickly. The remaining 5% of vaccinated people can become infected and get sick, but are extremely unlikely to be hospitalized.
Vaccination doesn’t 100% prevent you from getting infected, but in all cases it gives your immune system a huge leg up on the coronavirus. Whatever your outcome – whether complete protection from infection or some level of disease – you will be better off after encountering the virus than if you hadn’t been vaccinated.
Transmission happens when enough viral particles from an infected person get into the body of an uninfected person. In theory, anyone infected with the coronavirus could potentially transmit it. But a vaccine will reduce the chance of this happening.
In general, if vaccination doesn’t completely prevent infection, it will significantly reduce the amount of virus coming out of your nose and mouth – a process called shedding – and shorten the time that you shed the virus. This is a big deal. A person who sheds less virus is less likely to transmit it to someone else.
This seems to be the case with coronavirus vaccines. In a recent preprint study which has yet to be peer reviewed, Israeli researchers tested 2,897 vaccinated people for signs of coronavirus infection. Most had no detectable virus, but people who were infected had one-quarter the amount of virus in their bodies as unvaccinated people tested at similar times post-infection.
Less coronavirus virus means less chance of spreading it, and if the amount of virus in your body is low enough, the probability of transmitting it may reach almost zero. However, researchers don’t yet know where that cutoff is for the coronavirus, and since the vaccines don’t provide 100% protection from infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people continue to wear masks and social distance even after they’ve been vaccinated.
New variants of coronavirus have emerged in recent months, and recent studies show that vaccines are less effective against certain ones, like the B1351 variant first identified in South Africa.
Every time SARS-CoV-2 replicates, it gets new mutations. In recent months, researchers have found new variants that are more infective – meaning a person needs to breathe in less virus to become infected – and other variants that are more transmissible – meaning they increase the amount of virus a person sheds. And researchers have also found at least one new variant that seems to be better at evading the immune system, according to early data.
So how does this relate to vaccines and transmission?
For the South Africa variant, vaccines still provide greater than 85% protection from getting severely ill with COVID–19. But when you count mild and moderate cases, they provide, at best, only about 50%-60% protection. That means at least 40% of vaccinated people will still have a strong enough infection – and enough virus in their body – to cause at least moderate disease.
If vaccinated people have more virus in their bodies and it takes less of that virus to infect another person, there will be higher probability a vaccinated person could transmit these new strains of the coronavirus.
If all goes well, vaccines will very soon reduce the rate of severe disease and death worldwide. To be sure, any vaccine that reduces disease severity is also, at the population level, reducing the amount of virus being shed overall. But because of the emergence of new variants, vaccinated people still have the potential to shed and spread the coronavirus to other people, vaccinated or otherwise. This means it will likely take much longer for vaccines to reduce transmission and for populations to reach herd immunity than if these new variants had never emerged. Exactly how long that will take is a balance between how effective vaccines are against emerging strains and how transmissible and infectious these new strains are. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-panel-issues-strong-advice-against-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19/,WHO panel issues strong advice against hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19,"The drug hydroxychloroquine, once touted by Donald Trump as a pandemic “game-changer,” should not be used to prevent COVID-19 and has no meaningful effect on patients already infected, a World Health Organization expert panel said on Tuesday, March 2.
The anti-inflammatory drug should not be used in the fight against the pandemic, the WHO’s Guideline Development Group (GDG) expert panel wrote in the BMJ British medical journal, and is “not worthwhile” exploring in further research studies of possible COVID-19 treatments.
This “strong recommendation,” the experts said, is based on high-certainty evidence from six randomized controlled trials involving more than 6,000 participants both with and without known exposure to COVID-19.
Former US President Trump said last March that hydroxychloroquine could be a game-changer in the coronavirus pandemic. He also said he was taking it himself, even after the US medicines regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), advised that its efficacy and safety were unproven.
But the WHO’s experts said they now “judged that almost all people would not consider this drug worthwhile.”
“The panel considers that this drug is no longer a research priority and that resources should rather be oriented to evaluate other more promising drugs to prevent COVID-19,” they wrote.
The WHO noted in a statement that the recommendation is a so-called “living guideline” on potential drugs for COVID-19.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/russian-scientists-say-sputnik-v-performs-well-against-covid-19-mutations/,Russian scientists say Sputnik V performs well against COVID-19 mutations,"A Russian trial testing the effectiveness of revaccination with the Sputnik V shot to protect against new mutations of the coronavirus is producing strong results, researchers said on Saturday.
Last month, President Vladimir Putin ordered a review by March 15 of Russian-produced vaccines for their effectiveness against new variants spreading in different parts of the world.
“(A) recent study carried out by the Gamaleya Centre in Russia showed that revaccination with Sputnik V vaccine is working very well against new coronavirus mutations, including the UK and South African strains of coronavirus,” said Denis Logunov, a deputy director of the center, which developed the Sputnik V shot.
Results of the trial are expected to be published soon, but this was the first indication of how the tests are going. No further details were available yet.
So-called viral vector shots – such as Sputnik V and a shot developed by AstraZeneca – use harmless modified viruses as vehicles, or vectors, to carry genetic information that helps the body build immunity against future infections.
The revaccination used the same Sputnik V shot, based upon the same adenovirus vectors. The trial indicated this did not impact effectiveness, Logunov said in a statement to Reuters.
Some scientists have raised the possible risk that the body also develops immunity to the vector itself, recognizing it as an intruder and trying to destroy it.
But developers of Sputnik V disagreed this would pose long-term problems.
“We believe that vector-based vaccines are actually better for future revaccinations than vaccines based on other platforms,” Logunov said.
He said that the researchers found that antibodies specific to the vectors used by the shot – which could generate an anti-vector reaction and undermine the work of the shot itself – waned “as early as 56 days after vaccination”.
This conclusion was based on a trial of a vaccine against Ebola developed earlier by the Gamaleya Institute using the same approach as for the Sputnik V shot.
Vector immunity is not a new issue but has come under renewed scrutiny as companies including Johnson & Johnson anticipate regular COVID-19 vaccinations, like annual influenza shots, may be needed to combat new variants of the coronavirus.",Reuters,"Feb 27, 2021 10:06 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/lab-grown-mini-brains-suggest-mutation-might-have-rewired-human-mind-the-conversation/,Evolution: Lab-grown ‘mini brains’ suggest one mutation might have rewired the human mind,"How we humans became what we are today is a question that scientists have been trying to answer for a long time. How did we evolve such advanced cognitive abilities, giving rise to complex language, poetry and rocket science? In what way is the modern human brain different from those of our closest evolutionary relatives, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans?
By reintroducing ancient genes from such extinct species into human “mini brains” – clusters of stem cells grown in a lab that organise themselves into tiny versions of human brains – scientists have started to find new clues.
Most of what we know about human evolution comes from the study of ancient fossils and bones. We know that Neanderthals and Denisovans diverged from humans around 500,000-600,000 years ago, and that the last Neanderthals didn’t disappear from Europe until about 40,000 years ago.
Research has also shown that humans and Neanderthals interbred, and that Neanderthals were a lot more sophisticated than previously thought.
From studying the size and shape of fossilised skulls, we also know that brains from archaic humans were roughly the same size as modern human skulls, if not bigger, and appear to be different shapes. However, although such variations might be correlated with different cognitive abilities and functions, the fossils cannot alone explain how the shapes affect function. Luckily, recent technological advances have provided a new path to understanding how we differ from our extinct relatives.
Sequencing of ancient DNA has allowed scientists to compare genes of Neanderthals and Denisovans with that those of modern humans. This has helped identify differences and similarities, revealing that we share most of our DNA with the Neanderthals and Denisovans.
Still, in specific regions, there are gene variants exclusively carried by modern humans. These human-specific DNA regions may be responsible for traits that separate our species from our extinct relatives. By understanding how these genes work, we can therefore learn about the traits that are unique to modern humans.
Studies comparing archaic and modern DNA sequences have pinpointed differences in genes important for the function, behaviour and development of the brain – in particular genes involved in cell division and synapses (which transmit of electric nerve impulses between cells). These have suggested the human brain matures more slowly than the Neanderthal one did.
Specifically, the development of the orbitofrontal cortex in infants, which is thought to be involved in higher-order cognition like decision-making, might have changed significantly but subtly since the split from Neanderthals. Humans also reach sexual maturity later than their ancestors did, which can help explain why we live longer.
It has long been unclear which evolutionary changes have been the most important. A team of scientists led by Alysson Muotri at the University of California, San Diego, recently published a study in Science that shed some light on this question.
They did this by growing mini brains – which are known scientifically as “organoids” – from stem cells derived from skin. Brain organoids aren’t conscious in the way we are – they are very simple and do not reach sizes larger than around five or six millimetres, due to a lack of blood supply. But they can emit brainwaves and grow relatively complex neural networks that respond to light.
The team inserted an extinct version of a gene involved in brain development in the organoids using the Nobel-prize winning CRISPR-Cas9 technology, known as “genetic scissors”, which allows precise editing and manipulation of genes.
We know that the old version of the gene was present in Neanderthals and Denisovans, whereas a mutation later changed the gene into the current version that modern humans carry.
The engineered organoids displayed several differences. They expanded more slowly than the human organoids and had altered formation of connections between neurons. They were also smaller and had rough, complex surfaces compared to the smooth and spherical modern human organoids.
The study identified 61 genes that are different between modern and archaic humans. One of these genes is NOVA1, which has an essential role in regulating other genes’ activity during early brain development. It also plays a role in the formation of synapses.
Altered activity of NOVA1 has previously been found to cause neurological disorders such as microcephaly (leading to a small head), seizures, severe developmental delay and a genetic disorder called familial dysautonomia, suggesting it is important for normal human brain function. The version that modern humans carry has a change in one single letter of the code. This change causes the gene’s product, the NOVA1 protein, to have a different composition and possibly a different activity.
When analysing the organoids, scientists found that the archaic NOVA1 gene changed the activity of 277 other genes – many of them are involved in creating synapses and connections between brain cells. As a result, the mini brains had a different network of cells to those of a modern human.
That means that the mutation in NOVA1 caused essential changes in our brains. A change in a single letter of the DNA code possibly sparking a new level of brain function in modern humans. What we don’t know is how exactly this happened.
The team has said they will follow up their fascinating finding by investigating the other 60 genes in more detail, to see what happens when you alter each one or a combination of several.
It’s no doubt an intriguing area of research, with the organoids giving important insight into these ancient species’ brains. But we are only at the beginning. Manipulation of a single gene will not capture the true Neanderthal and Denisovan genetics. But it could still help scientists understand how some human-specific genes work.",Itzia Ferrer,"Feb 27, 2021 11:46 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/how-does-johnson-vaccine-compare-other-coronavirus-vaccines/,How does the Johnson & Johnson vaccine compare to other coronavirus vaccines?,"On Tuesday, February 24, the US Food and Drug Administration released the results of its trial of the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine. The FDA found the vaccine to be safe and effective and it is expected to grant emergency use authorization in the coming days. Maureen Ferran, a virologist at the Rochester Institute of Technology, explains how this new vaccine works and explores the differences between it and the already approved Moderna and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccines.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is what’s called a viral vector vaccine.
To create this vaccine, the Johnson & Johnson team took a harmless adenovirus – the viral vector – and replaced a small piece of its genetic instructions with coronavirus genes for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
After this modified adenovirus is injected into someone’s arm, it enters the person’s cells. The cells then read the genetic instructions needed to make the spike protein and the vaccinated cells make and present the spike protein on their own surface. The person’s immune system then notices these foreign proteins and makes antibodies against them that will protect the person if they are ever exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the future.
The adenovirus vector vaccine is safe because the adenovirus can’t replicate in human cells or cause disease, and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can’t cause COVID–19 without the rest of the coronavirus.
This approach is not new. Johnson & Johnson used a similar method to make its Ebola vaccine, and the AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine is also an adenovirus viral vector vaccine.
The FDA’s analysis found that, in the US, the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine was 72% effective at preventing all COVID-19 and 86% effective at preventing severe cases of the disease. While there is still a chance a vaccinated person could get sick, this suggests they would be much less likely to need hospitalization or to die from COVID-19.
A similar trial in South Africa, where a new, more contagious variant is dominant, produced similar results. Researchers found the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to be slightly less effective at preventing all illness there – 64% overall – but was still 82% effective at preventing severe disease. The FDA report also indicates that the vaccine protects against other variants from Britain and Brazil too.
The most basic difference is that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is an adenovirus vector vaccine, while the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are both mRNA vaccines. Messenger RNA vaccines use genetic instructions from the coronavirus to tell a person’s cells to make the spike protein, but these don’t use another virus as a vector. There are many practical differences, too.
Both of the mRNA-based vaccines require two shots. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires only a single dose. This is key when vaccines are in short supply.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine can also be stored at much warmer temperatures than the mRNA vaccines. The mRNA vaccines must be shipped and stored at below–freezing or subzero temperatures and require a complicated cold chain to safely distribute them. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine can be stored for at least three months in a regular refrigerator, making it much easier to use and distribute.
As for efficacy, it is difficult to directly compare the Johnson & Johnson vaccine with the mRNA vaccines due to differences in how the clinical trials were designed. While the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are reported to be approximately 95% effective at preventing illness from COVID–19, the trials were done over the summer and fall of 2020, before newer more contagious variants were circulating widely. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines might not be as effective against the new variants, and Johnson & Johnson trials were done more recently and take into account the vaccine’s efficacy against these new variants.
Although the overall efficacy of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines is higher than the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you should not wait until you have your choice of vaccine – which is likely a long way off anyway. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is nearly as good as the mRNA-based vaccines at preventing serious disease, and that’s what really matters.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine and other viral-vector vaccines like the one from AstraZeneca are particularly important for the global vaccination effort. From a public health perspective, it’s important to have multiple COVID-19 vaccines, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a very welcome addition to the vaccine arsenal. It doesn’t require a freezer, making it much easier to ship and store. It’s a one-shot vaccine, making logistics much easier compared with organizing two doses per person.
As many people as possible need to be vaccinated as quickly as possible to limit the development of new coronavirus variants. Johnson & Johnson is expected to ship out nearly four million doses as soon as the FDA grants emergency use authorization. Having a third authorized vaccine in the US will be a big step towards meeting vaccination demand and stopping this pandemic.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/debilitating-long-covid-severe-health-social-impacts-who/,"Debilitating ‘long COVID’ may have severe health, social impacts – WHO","Thousands of COVID-19 patients continue to suffer serious, debilitating and lingering symptoms many months after their initial bout of infection, with major social, health and economic consequences, European health experts said on Thursday, February 25.
Publishing a World Health Organization-led guidance report on the condition, often referred to as “long COVID” or “post-COVID syndrome,” experts said around 1 in 10 COVID-19 patients are still unwell 12 weeks after their acute infection, and many suffer symptoms for far longer.
“This is a condition that can be extremely debilitating. Those suffering from it describe a varying combination of overlapping symptoms… (including) chest and muscle pain, fatigue, shortness of breath…brain fog (and) many others,” said Martin McKee, a professor at the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies who led the report.
Hans Kluge, the WHO’s European regional director, said long-COVID could have “severe social, economic, health and occupational consequences.”
“The burden is real and it is significant,” he said.
He urged health authorities to listen to patients’ concerns, take them seriously, and establish services to help them.
Growing evidence from around the world points to many thousands of people experiencing long-COVID. The condition appears not to be linked to whether a patient had a severe or mild infection.
An initial report by Britain’s National Institute for Health Research last year suggested long-COVID may be not one condition, but multiple syndromes causing a rollercoaster of symptoms affecting the body and mind.
Kluge noted that as with any new disease, much remains unknown about COVID-19.
“We need to listen and … understand. The sufferers of post-COVID conditions need to be heard if we are to understand the long-term consequences and recovery from COVID-19,” he said. “This is a clear priority for WHO (and) it should be for every health authority.”",Reuters,"Feb 25, 2021 10:17 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-vaccine-found-94-effective-in-real-world/,Pfizer vaccine found 94% effective in real world,"The first big real-world study of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be independently reviewed shows the shot is highly effective at preventing COVID-19, in a potentially landmark moment for countries desperate to end lockdowns and reopen economies.
Up until now, most data on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines has come under controlled conditions in clinical trials, leaving an element of uncertainty over how results would translate into the real world with its unpredictable variables.
The research in Israel – two months into one of the world’s fastest rollouts, providing a rich source of data – showed two doses of the Pfizer shot cut symptomatic COVID-19 cases by 94% across all age groups, and severe illnesses by nearly as much.
The study of about 1.2 million people also showed a single shot was 57% effective in protecting against symptomatic infections after two weeks, according to the data published and peer-reviewed in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, February 24.
The results of the study for the Clalit Research Institute were close to those in clinical trials last year which said two doses were found to be 95% effective.
“We were surprised because we expected that in the real-world setting, where cold chain is not maintained perfectly and the population is older and sicker, that you will not get as good results as you got in the controlled clinical trials,” senior study author Ran Balicer told Reuters. “But we did and the vaccine worked as well in the real world.”
“We have shown the vaccine to be as effective in very different sub-groups, in the young and in the old in those with no co-morbidities and in those with few co-morbidities,” he added.
The study also suggests the vaccine, developed by US drugmaker Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech, is effective against the coronavirus variant first identified in the UK. Researchers said they could not provide a specific level of efficacy, but the variant was the dominant version of the virus in Israel at the time of the study.
The research did not shed light on how the Pfizer shot will fare against another variant, now dominant in South Africa, that has been shown to reduce the efficacy of other vaccines.
Of the 9 million people in Israel, a nation with universal healthcare, nearly half have received a first dose, and a third have received both doses since the rollout began on December 19.
This made the country a prime location for a real-world study into the vaccine’s ability to stem the pandemic, along with its advanced data capabilities.
The study examined about 600,000 vaccinated people against the same sized control group of unvaccinated people. Researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital also collaborated.
“This is more great news, confirming that the vaccine is around 90% effective at preventing documented infection of any degree of severity from 7 days after the second dose,” said Peter English, a British government consultant in communicable disease control.
“Previous recently studied papers from Israel were observational studies. This one used an experimental design known as a case-control study … giving greater confidence that differences between the groups are due to their vaccination status, and not to some other factor.”
The study published on Wednesday was the first analysis of a national COVID-19 vaccination strategy to be peer-reviewed. It also offered a more detailed look at how the vaccine was faring at weekly intervals, while matching people who received the shot to unvaccinated individuals with similar medical histories, sex, age and geographical characteristics.
Other research centers in Israel, including the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Israel Institute of Technology have shared several studies in recent weeks that show the vaccine to be effective.
At least 3 studies out of Israel have also suggested the vaccine can reduce coronavirus transmission, but the researchers have cautioned that wider studies must be conducted in order to establish clear-cut conclusions.
The Weizmann Institute’s latest data shows a dramatic drop in illness – which began this month with the first age group vaccinated, the over-60s – has now extended to the two subsequent groups to have completed both doses.
As infections have fallen in Israel, the country has eased its third national lockdown and reopened swathes of its economy including malls, shops, schools and many workplaces in the past two weeks.
Recreational venues such as theaters, gyms and hotels opened on Sunday, but are open only to those deemed immune – holders of a “Green Pass,” a health ministry document available for download only by people 7 days after their second dose or people who have recovered from COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Tel Aviv held one of the country’s first live concerts after months of gatherings being banned under coronavirus restrictions.
“This is so exciting, we are really so happy to be here today. It’s unbelievable after one year of staying at home, it’s great to be out to see some culture,” said 60-year-old Gabi Shamir as she took her seat at the open-air show.
Still, the vaccine’s efficacy does not mean the country will be pandemic free any time soon. Like elsewhere in the world, a large proportion of the population are under 16 – about a third in Israel – meaning that they cannot yet get vaccinated as there have not been clinical trial results for children.
“This is definitely not the end of the pandemic,” said Eran Kopel, an epidemiologist at Tel Aviv University. “Once there is a safe vaccine for the children in Israel and all over the world we can then start to say that we could be approaching herd immunity.”",Reuters,"Feb 25, 2021 1:51 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/catching-covid-19-surfaces-very-unlikely-perhaps-ease-up-disinfecting/,Catching COVID-19 from surfaces is very unlikely. So perhaps we can ease up on the disinfecting.,"A lot has happened over the past year, so you can be forgiven for not having a clear memory of what some of the major concerns were at the beginning of the pandemic.
However, if you think back to the beginning of the pandemic, one of the major concerns was the role that surfaces played in the transmission of the virus.
As an epidemiologist, I remember spending countless hours responding to media requests answering questions along the lines of whether we should be washing the outside of food cans or disinfecting our mail.
Oh my. This is scary. @CSIRO has found covid can live on surfaces such as banknotes, glass (mobile phone screens) and stainless steel for up to 28 days 😐😷 https://t.co/ymQWoWeJlb
I also remember seeing teams of people walking the streets at all hours wiping down poles and cleaning public benches.
But what does the evidence actually say about surface transmission more than 12 months into this pandemic?
Before addressing this, we need to define the question we’re asking. The key question isn’t whether surface transmission is possible, or whether it can occur in the real world — it almost certainly can.
The real question is: what is the extent of the role of surface contact in the transmission of the virus? That is, what is the likelihood of catching COVID via a surface, as opposed to other methods of transmission?
There’s little evidence that surface transmission is a common way in which the coronavirus is spread. The main way it’s spread is by the air, either by larger droplets via close contact, or by smaller droplets called aerosols. As a side note, the relative role these two routes play in transmission is probably a much more interesting and important question to clarify from a public health perspective.
One of the best commentaries on COVID surface transmission was published in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases in July 2020 by Emanuel Goldman, a professor of microbiology from the United States.
As he described, one of the drivers for the exaggerated perception of the risk of surface transmission was the publication of a number of studies showing SARS-CoV-2 viral particles could be detected for long periods of time on various surfaces.
You probably saw these studies because they received enormous publicity worldwide and I remember doing numerous interviews in which I had to explain what these findings actually meant.
The virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on banknotes, glass and stainless steel for up to 28 days, much longer than the flu virus, Australian researchers said, highlighting the need for cleaning and handwashing to combat the virus https://t.co/Y1Qwwr3jau pic.twitter.com/PpQLGAkhw4
As I explained at the time, these studies could not be generalized to the real world, and in some instances the media releases accompanying them tended towards overstating the significance of these findings.
The key issue is that as a general principal the time required for a population of microoganisms to die is directly proportional to the size of that population. This means the greater the amount of virus deposited on a surface, the longer you will find viable viral particles on that surface.
So in terms of designing experiments that are relevant to public health, one of the more important variables in these studies is the amount of virus deposited on a surface — and the extent to which this approximates what would happen in the real world.
If you understand this, it becomes apparent that a number of these virus survival studies stacked the odds of detecting viable virus by depositing large amounts of virus on surfaces far in excess of what would be reasonably expected to be found in the real world. What’s more, some of these studies customized conditions that would extend the life of viral particles, such as adjusting humidity and excluding natural light.
Although there was nothing wrong with the science here, it was the real world relevance and the interpretation that was amiss at times. It’s notable that other studies which more closely replicated real world scenarios found less impressive survival times for three other human coronaviruses (including SARS).
It’s important to note we’re relying on indirect evidence in assessing the role of surface transmission for the coronavirus. That is, you can’t actually do an ethical scientific experiment that confirms the role surface transmission plays because you’d have to deliberately infect people. Despite being such a seemingly straightforward question, it’s surprisingly difficult to determine the relative importance of the various transmission pathways for this virus.
What we have to do instead is look at all of the evidence we do have and see what it’s telling us, including case studies describing transmission events. And if we do this, there isn’t a lot out there to support surface transmission being of major importance in the spread of COVID.
We need to put the risks of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via the various modes of transmission into perspective, so we focus our limited energy and resources on the right things.
This isn’t to say surface transmission isn’t possible and that it doesn’t pose a risk in certain situations, or that we should disregard it completely. But, we should acknowledge the threat surface transmission poses is relatively small.
We can therefore mitigate this relatively small risk by continuing to focus on hand hygiene and ensuring cleaning protocols are more in keeping with the risk of surface transmission.
In doing this, we can potentially save millions of dollars being spent on obsessive cleaning practices. These are probably providing little or no benefit and being done solely because they’re easy to do and provide the reassurance of doing something, thereby relieving some of our anxieties.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/new-coronavirus-variant-identified-new-york/,New coronavirus variant identified in New York,"A new coronavirus variant that shares some similarities with a more transmissible and intractable variant discovered in South Africa is on the rise in New York City, researchers said on Wednesday, February 24.
The new variant, known as B.1.526, was first identified in samples collected in New York in November, and by mid-February represented about 12% of cases, researchers at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said on Wednesday.
The variant was also described in research published online this week by the California Institute of Technology. Neither study has been reviewed by outside experts.
The Columbia researchers said an analysis of publicly available databases did not show a high prevalence of coronavirus variants recently identified in South Africa and Brazil in case samples from New York City and surrounding areas.
“Instead we found high numbers of this home-grown lineage,” Dr Anne-Catrin Uhlemann, assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases at Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons, said in a statement.
The Columbia study found that B.1.526 shares some worrying characteristics with B.1.351, the variant first identified in South Africa, and P.1., which was first identified in Brazil. Several studies have suggested that those new variants are more resistant to some existing vaccines than earlier versions of the coronavirus.
The researchers said the main concern is a change in one area of the virus’ spike protein, called E484K, that is present in all 3 variants. The E484K mutation is believed to weaken the body’s immune response to the virus.
Studies have shown that recently launched coronavirus vaccines are still likely to neutralize the virus and protect against severe illness, even for infections with new variants. Vaccine makers are also working to develop booster shots to combat mutated versions of the virus.",Reuters,"Feb 25, 2021 9:35 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/johnson-johnson-one-shot-covid-19-vaccine-effective-safe-us-fda-staff/,Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot COVID-19 vaccine effective and safe – US FDA staff,"Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot COVID-19 vaccine appeared safe and effective in trials, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) staff said in documents published on Wednesday, February 24, paving the way for its approval for emergency use.
The FDA’s panel of independent experts meets on Friday to decide whether to approve the shot. While it is not bound to follow the advice of its experts, the FDA usually does and has authorized vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna.
J&J said in documents submitted to the FDA that its data suggested its vaccine was effective at preventing asymptomatic infections. It said that in a preliminary analysis of its trial, it found 16 cases of asymptomatic cases in the placebo group versus two in the vaccine group, or an 88% efficacy rate.
While asymptomatic infection was not the primary goal of the trial, which studied the vaccine’s ability to stop moderate to severe COVID-19, the reduction of asymptomatic cases implies the shot can also cut transmission of the disease.
J&J’s vaccine was 66% effective in preventing COVID-19 against multiple variants in a global trial involving nearly 44,000 people, the company said last month.
Its effectiveness varied from 72% in the United States to 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa, where a new variant has spread, though the vaccine was 85% effective overall in stopping severe cases of the disease.
The vaccine was effective in reducing the risk of COVID-19 and preventing PCR-test confirmed COVID-19 at least 14 days after vaccination, the FDA said in its briefing documents.
Fourteen days after injection, only two vaccine recipients developed COVID-19 severe enough to need medical intervention, compared with 14 in the placebo group. After 28 days, no vaccine recipients developed COVID severe enough to require medical intervention whereas 7 in the placebo group did.
Three vaccine recipients had severe side effects in the trial that were likely related to the vaccine, but the FDA said its analysis did not raise any specific safety concerns that would preclude issuance of an emergency use authorization.
The FDA said the most common solicited adverse reactions were injection site pain at 48.6%, headache at 39%, fatigue at 38.2% and myalgia at 33.2%. Other side effects included a fever in 9% of participants and a high fever in 0.2% of those who received the vaccine.
The regulator said one case of pericarditis, a heart disease, may have been caused by the vaccine. It said cases of a rare disorder, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, were unlikely to be related to the shot though data was insufficient to determine whether or not the vaccine had caused these side effects.
J&J had not previously released details of its clinical trial data beyond efficacy rates.",Reuters,"Feb 24, 2021 10:27 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/how-do-people-know-covid-19-vaccine-will-not-have-long-term-side-effects/,How do we know the COVID-19 vaccine won’t have long-term side-effects?,"As Australia’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout begins this week, many people still have questions about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, both in the short and long term.
As vaccine experts, we hear these concerns all the time, and it’s normal to have questions about a vaccine.
The good news is that scientists have already been testing COVID-19 vaccines for months. For starters, serious side-effects are very, very rare. And, together with what we know about previous vaccines, if side-effects are going to occur, they usually happen within a few months after getting a vaccine. This is why international medical regulators, including Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), require the first few months of safety data before approving new vaccines. This, plus information coming from vaccine recipients in the northern hemisphere, gives us confidence that COVID-19 vaccines are safe.
In fact, most side-effects occur within the first one or two days. And most of these are minor, such as pain at the injection site, fatigue or fever — which are signs your immune system is building a response against the thing you’ve been vaccinated against.
Since December, more than 200 million people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine worldwide — more than the total number of people who have been infected with the virus (112 million).
Given the sheer number of vaccines administered to date, common, uncommon and rare side-effects would have been detected by now. What’s more, we’ve been testing these vaccines in clinical trials since mid-2020, and both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have shown excellent safety results.
This gives us confidence the vaccines that’ll be used around Australia are safe.
We’ve also seen some people raise concerns online about mRNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, being a “new” technology. mRNA (or “messenger” RNA) is found in all living cells. mRNA is a message that tells cells how to make proteins that trigger the immune response inside the body. That immune response is what protects against infection if an individual is exposed to the virus. mRNA is not the same as DNA (your genes), and it cannot combine with our DNA to change our genetic code. mRNA vaccines do not affect or interact with DNA in any way. So we can be assured there’ll be no long-term DNA-altering effects from these vaccines.
What’s more, checking the safety of the vaccines doesn’t just stop after they’ve been registered for use. Once a vaccine has been introduced, ongoing monitoring of its safety is a crucial part of the vaccine development process.
Australia has a robust system for this ongoing monitoring. The system was established to detect any unexpected side-effects from vaccines (if they occur) and ensure they’re investigated promptly. This type of monitoring is standard practise in Australia for vaccines. The data about COVID-19 vaccination collected in these surveillance systems will be published weekly on the TGA website. This should reassure Australians that if there’s a new serious side-effect, we will know about it, communicate it, and act on it quickly.
Withdrawal of vaccines after introduction to the general population is a very rare event. In the United States, a rotavirus vaccine called Rotashield led to a small increase in the number of small intestinal blockages. This prompted its withdrawal in the late 1990s. In Australia, an increased risk of febrile seizures in young children following a specific influenza vaccine was identified in 2010. It was subsequently withdrawn from use in that age group, and we now vaccinate with a different, safer flu vaccine. This vaccine is no longer available in Australia, and has been subsequently reformulated.
Both of these side-effects were observed within weeks of vaccination.
We now have improved monitoring systems in Australia to detect such serious side-effects even sooner, in the general population after clinical trials, than we did a decade ago.
The expected side-effects of the Pfizer vaccine have been reported from trials involving roughly 43,000 participants aged 16 years and older from the US, Argentina, Brazil and South Africa. Half of the participants received the Pfizer vaccine and half received a placebo. And as part of COVID-19 vaccine rollouts around the world, millions of people have already been given this vaccine since December, meaning we have safety data now from both clinical trials and two months of “real world” vaccination.
For those receiving this vaccine in the large clinical trials which started in July 2020, about 80% have reported pain at the injection site. Other common side-effects included fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and fever.
These were most often reported one or two days after the day of vaccination, and typically only lasted about one day. While some vaccine recipients may need a day off work due to some of these side-effects, this does not indicate the vaccine is unsafe.
In trials, no difference was seen in the rate of severe side-effects between the Pfizer vaccine and placebo. Early in the US program, 21 cases of anaphylaxis were reported. It’s estimated anaphylaxis occurs at a rate of 11 in every one million recipients (0.0011%) of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Most occurred within 15 minutes, and all patients recovered. This is why it’s a good idea though to remain at the vaccine clinic for up to 15 minutes after vaccination so that treatment and care can be provided if necessary.
A further concern was raised in January, after the death of 30 very frail elderly patients in Norway after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. But investigation by the European regulator concluded these weren’t related to the vaccine, but rather to underlying conditions present before vaccination.
This vaccine has been tested in ongoing trials with around 55,000 participants from the United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa and the US. About half received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and half a placebo. Millions of doses have been already been administered among the general population, particularly in the UK.
Data from 4 clinical trials which commenced in April 2020 in the UK, Brazil and South Africa, show the most common side-effects were pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache and muscle pain. Similar to the Pfizer vaccine, there was no difference in the rate of reported severe side-effects for the vaccine compared with the placebo.
Just 0.7% of participants (79 people) from the 4 clinical trials who received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine reported a serious side-effect after receiving at least one dose, compared with 0.8% (89 people) of those in the placebo group. No additional safety concerns have been identified since the vaccination program began in the UK.
With countries continuing to monitor those who have received vaccines, we should be reassured there are no major safety concerns detected for serious side-effects so far. With millions of people vaccinated already, our confidence about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines is very high.
In Australia, and internationally, we have robust systems in place to continually monitor vaccine safety, ensuring Australians can be safely afforded the protection that COVID-19 vaccines are designed to provide. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/australian-doctor-who-covid-19-mission-china/,I was the Australian doctor on the WHO’s COVID-19 mission to China. Here’s what we found.,"As I write, I am in hotel quarantine in Sydney, after returning from Wuhan, China. There, I was the Australian representative on the international World Health Organization’s (WHO) investigation into the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Much has been said of the politics surrounding the mission to investigate the viral origins of COVID-19. So it’s easy to forget that behind these investigations are real people.
As part of the mission, we met the man who, on December 8, 2019, was the first confirmed COVID-19 case; he’s since recovered. We met the husband of a doctor who died of COVID-19 and left behind a young child. We met the doctors who worked in the Wuhan hospitals treating those early COVID-19 cases, and learned what happened to them and their colleagues. We witnessed the impact of COVID-19 on many individuals and communities, affected so early in the pandemic, when we didn’t know much about the virus, how it spreads, how to treat COVID-19, or its impacts.
We talked to our Chinese counterparts — scientists, epidemiologists, doctors — over the 4 weeks the WHO mission was in China. We were in meetings with them for up to 15 hours a day, so we became colleagues, even friends. This allowed us to build respect and trust in a way you couldn’t necessarily do via Zoom or email.
This is what we learned about the origins of SARS-CoV-2.
It was in Wuhan, in central China, that the virus, now called SARS-CoV-2, emerged in December 2019, unleashing the greatest infectious disease outbreak since the 1918-19 influenza pandemic.
Our investigations concluded the virus was most likely of animal origin. It probably crossed over to humans from bats, via an as-yet-unknown intermediary animal, at an unknown location. Such “zoonotic” diseases have triggered pandemics before. But we are still working to confirm the exact chain of events that led to the current pandemic. Sampling of bats in Hubei province and wildlife across China has revealed no SARS-CoV-2 to date.
We visited the now-closed Wuhan wet market which, in the early days of the pandemic, was blamed as the source of the virus. Some stalls at the market sold “domesticated” wildlife products. These are animals raised for food, such as bamboo rats, civets, and ferret badgers. There is also evidence some domesticated wildlife may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. However, none of the animal products sampled after the market’s closure tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
We also know not all of those first 174 early COVID-19 cases visited the market, including the man who was diagnosed in December 2019 with the earliest onset date.
However, when we visited the closed market, it’s easy to see how an infection might have spread there. When it was open, there would have been around 10,000 people visiting a day, in close proximity, with poor ventilation and drainage.
There’s also genetic evidence generated during the mission for a transmission cluster there. Viral sequences from several of the market cases were identical, suggesting a transmission cluster. However, there was some diversity in other viral sequences, implying other unknown or unsampled chains of transmission.
A summary of modeling studies of the time to the most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 sequences estimated the start of the pandemic between mid-November and early December. There are also publications suggesting SARS-CoV-2 circulation in various countries earlier than the first case in Wuhan, although these require confirmation.
The market in Wuhan, in the end, was more of an amplifying event rather than necessarily a true ground zero. So we need to look elsewhere for the viral origins.
Then there was the “cold chain” hypothesis. This is the idea the virus might have originated from elsewhere via the farming, catching, processing, transporting, refrigeration, or freezing of food. Was that food ice cream, fish, wildlife meat? We don’t know. It’s unproven that this triggered the origin of the virus itself. But to what extent did it contribute to its spread? Again, we don’t know.
Several “cold chain” products present in the Wuhan market were not tested for the virus. Environmental sampling in the market showed viral surface contamination. This may indicate the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through infected people, or contaminated animal products and “cold chain” products. Investigation of “cold chain” products and virus survival at low temperatures is still underway.
The most politically sensitive option we looked at was the virus escaping from a laboratory. We concluded this was extremely unlikely.
We visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is an impressive research facility, and looks to be run well, with due regard to staff health.
We spoke to the scientists there. We heard that scientists’ blood samples, which are routinely taken and stored, were tested for signs they had been infected. No evidence of antibodies to the coronavirus was found. We looked at their biosecurity audits. No evidence.
We looked at the closest virus to SARS-CoV-2 they were working on — the virus RaTG13 — which had been detected in caves in southern China where some miners had died 7 years previously.
But all the scientists had was a genetic sequence for this virus. They hadn’t managed to grow it in culture. While viruses certainly do escape from laboratories, this is rare. So, we concluded it was extremely unlikely this had happened in Wuhan.
When I say “we,” the mission was a joint exercise between the WHO and the Chinese health commission. In all, there were 17 Chinese and 10 international experts, plus 7 other experts and support staff from various agencies. We looked at the clinical epidemiology (how COVID-19 spread among people), the molecular epidemiology (the genetic makeup of the virus and its spread), and the role of animals and the environment.
The clinical epidemiology group alone looked at China’s records of 76,000 episodes from more than 200 institutions of anything that could have resembled COVID-19 — such as influenza-like illnesses, pneumonia, and other respiratory illnesses. They found no clear evidence of substantial circulation of COVID-19 in Wuhan during the latter part of 2019 before the first case.
Our mission to China was only phase one. We are due to publish our official report in the coming weeks. Investigators will also look further afield for data, to investigate evidence the virus was circulating in Europe, for instance, earlier in 2019. Investigators will continue to test wildlife and other animals in the region for signs of the virus. And we’ll continue to learn from our experiences to improve how we investigate the next pandemic.
Irrespective of the origins of the virus, individual people with the disease are at the beginning of the epidemiology data points, sequences and numbers. The long-term physical and psychological effects — the tragedy and anxiety — will be felt in Wuhan, and elsewhere, for decades to come.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-agrees-compensation-fund-serious-covax-vaccine-side-effects/,WHO agrees on compensation fund for serious COVAX vaccine side effects,"The World Health Organization has agreed a no-fault compensation plan for claims of serious side effects in people in 92 poorer countries due to get COVID-19 vaccines via the COVAX sharing scheme, resolving a big concern among recipient governments.
The program, which the WHO said was the first and only vaccine injury compensation mechanism operating on an international scale, will offer eligible people “a fast, fair, robust, and transparent process,” the WHO said in a statement.
“By providing a no-fault lump-sum compensation in full and final settlement of any claims, the COVAX program aims to significantly reduce the need for recourse to the law courts, a potentially lengthy and costly process,” the statement said.
Questions of how compensation claims would be handled in the event of any serious COVID-19 vaccine side effects, which are likely to be very rare, had been a worry for countries due to get COVID-19 shots via the COVAX plan.
Countries funding their own COVID-19 vaccine procurement also plan their own liability programmes.
The WHO-agreed plan, which has been under discussion for several months, is designed to cover serious side effects linked to any COVAX-distributed vaccines until June 30, 2022, to COVAX’s Advance Market Commitment-eligible economies – a group of 92 poorer states which includes most African and Southeast Asian countries.
The program will be financed initially from donor funding to the AMC as an extra charge on all doses of COVID-19 vaccines distributed through COVAX. Applications can be made via a portal at www.covaxclaims.com from March 31, 2021, the WHO said.
Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI vaccine alliance which co-leads COVAX, said the agreement on the compensation fund was “a massive boost” for COVAX, which aims to secure equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines.
“It helps those in countries who might have such effects, manufacturers to roll out vaccines to countries faster, and is a key benefit for lower-income governments procuring vaccines through (COVAX),” Berkley said.
The WHO said it was also working with the insurance firm Chubb to secure insurance coverage for the program.",Reuters,"Feb 23, 2021 8:32 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/gsk-sanofi-start-new-covid-19-vaccine-study-after-setback/,GSK and Sanofi start with new COVID-19 vaccine study after setback,"GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi on Monday, February 22, said they had started a new clinical trial of their protein-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate, reviving their efforts against the pandemic after a setback in December delayed the shot’s launch.
The British and French drugmakers aim to reach final testing in the 2nd quarter, and if the results are conclusive, hope to see the vaccine approved by the 4th quarter after having initially targeted the first half of this year.
In December, the two groups stunned investors when they said their vaccine would be delayed towards the end of 2021 after clinical trials showed an insufficient immune response in older people.
Disappointing results were probably caused by an inadequate concentration of the antigen used in the vaccine, Sanofi and GSK said, adding that Sanofi has also started work against new coronavirus variants to help plan their next steps.
Global coronavirus infections have exceeded 110 million as highly transmissible variants of the virus are prompting vaccine developers and governments to tweak their testing and immunization strategies.
GSK and Sanofi’s vaccine candidate uses the same recombinant protein-based technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines. It will be coupled with an adjuvant, a substance that acts as a booster to the shot, made by GSK.
“Over the past few weeks, our teams have worked to refine the antigen formulation of our recombinant-protein vaccine,” Thomas Triomphe, executive vice president and head of Sanofi Pasteur, said in a statement.
The new mid-stage trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immune response of the vaccine in 720 healthy adults across the United States, Honduras and Panama and test two injections given 21 days apart.
Sanofi and GSK have secured deals to supply their vaccine to the European Union, Britain, Canada and the United States. It also plans to provide shots to the World Health Organization’s COVAX program.
To appease critics after the delay, Sanofi said earlier this year it had agreed to fill and pack millions of doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from July.
Sanofi is also working with Translate Bio on another COVID-19 vaccine candidate based on mRNA technology.",Reuters,"Feb 22, 2021 8:47 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/fujifilm-restart-clinical-trial-avigan-treatment-covid-19/,Fujifilm to restart clinical trial of Avigan to treat COVID-19,"Fujifilm Holdings Corp will restart a clinical trial in Japan of its antiviral drug Avigan for the treatment of COVID-19, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Sunday, February 21.
Domestic approval of the drug was delayed after a health ministry panel said in December that trial data was inconclusive. The new study will involve about 270 patients and Fujifilm will aim to seek approval again in October, Nikkei said.
Representatives from Fujifilm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Japan has approved Avigan, known generically as favipiravir, as an emergency flu medicine. But concerns remain, as the drug has been shown to cause birth defects in animal studies and its effectiveness against COVID-19 has proven difficult to demonstrate.
Japan’s government has called on Fujifilm to triple national stockpiles of the drug, which has been approved for COVID-19 treatment in Russia, India and Indonesia.",Reuters,"Feb 21, 2021 2:46 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/israeli-studies-find-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-reduces-transmission/,Israeli studies find Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine reduces transmission,"Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine greatly reduces virus transmission, two Israeli studies have found, shedding light on one of the biggest questions of the global effort to quash the pandemic.
Data analysis in a study by the Israeli Health Ministry and Pfizer Inc found the Pfizer vaccine developed with Germany’s BioNTech reduces infection, including in asymptomatic cases, by 89.4% and in symptomatic cases by 93.7%.
Findings of the pre-published study, not yet peer-reviewed, but based on a national database that is one of the world’s most advanced, were first reported by the Israeli news site Ynet late on Thursday, February 18, and were obtained by Reuters on Friday, February 19.
Pfizer declined to comment and the Israeli Health Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
A separate study by Israel’s Sheba Medical Center published on Friday in The Lancet medical journal found that among 7,214 hospital staff who received their first dose in January, there was an 85% reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 within 15 to 28 days with an overall reduction of infections, including asymptomatic cases detected by testing, of 75%.
More research is needed to draw a definitive conclusion, but the studies are among the first to suggest a vaccine may stop the spread of the novel coronavirus and not just prevent people from getting ill.
Michal Linial, a professor of molecular biology and bioinformatics at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, said the findings were a big step towards answering one of the most important questions in combating the pandemic.
“Whether it is 75% or 90% reduction doesn’t matter – it is a big drop in transmission,” Linial said. “It means that not only is the individual vaccinated protected, the inoculation also provides protection to his or her surroundings.”
The researchers said further study was needed on asymptomatic transmission among people fully vaccinated because they are less likely to be tested for COVID-19.
Vaccine developers have also said more research was needed on transmissibility. In December, Germany’s BioNTech said it would take 3 to 6 months more study.
Leading the world in its vaccination rollout, Israel’s universal healthcare and advanced data capabilities have provided a nationwide database that can offer insights into how effective the vaccines are outside controlled clinical trials.
The Health Ministry/Pfizer study analyzed data collected between January 17 and February 6, looking at individuals who had been fully vaccinated, after receiving their second Pfizer shot.
To date, more than 30% or 2.8 million of Israel’s 9 million population have received both doses.
Sheba’s study found that just the first dose of Pfizer’s vaccine was 85% effective, potentially fuelling a debate over the recommended two-dose schedule.
Canadian researchers in a letter published this week suggested that the second Pfizer dose be delayed given the high level of protection from the first shot to increase the number of people getting vaccinated.
The US Food and Drug Administration said in December data from those trials showed the vaccine began conferring some protection to recipients before they received the second shot, but more data would be needed to assess the potential of a single-dose shot.
Pfizer has said alternative dosing regimens of the vaccine have yet to be evaluated and that the decision resided with the health authorities.
Another caveat is that the cohort studied at the hospital were “mostly young and healthy,” Sheba epidemiologist Gili Regev-Yochay said.
Unlike with Pfizer’s clinical trial, “we don’t have many (staff) here aged over 65,” she told reporters. But she also said the Sheba study took place during a surge in coronavirus infections in Israel, which flooded hospitals with new cases.
Pfizer declined to comment on the data, saying in a statement it was doing its own analysis of “the vaccine’s real-world effectiveness in several locations worldwide, including Israel.”
Both studies’ findings compared with overall efficacy of around 95% in a two-dose regimen 21 days apart. The Health Ministry/Pfizer researchers found the vaccine to be effective against the British coronavirus variant that makes up about 80% of Israel’s confirmed cases.
Eran Kopel, an epidemiologist at Tel Aviv University said the Sheba study was important, but it focused on one hospital and a relatively small group of people, so “one could not draw clear-cut epidemiological conclusions from it.”
The Health Ministry’s data was encouraging, he said, but further research and regular surveys were needed.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/rich-nations-stockpiling-billion-more-covid-19-shots-than-needed/,Rich nations stockpiling a billion more COVID-19 shots than needed – report,"Rich countries are on course to have over a billion more doses of COVID-19 vaccines than they need, leaving poorer nations scrambling for leftover supplies as the world seeks to curb the coronavirus pandemic, a report by anti-poverty campaigners found on Friday, February 19.
In an analysis of current supply deals for COVID-19 vaccines, the ONE Campaign said wealthy countries, such as the United States and Britain, should share the excess doses to “supercharge” a fully global response to the pandemic.
The advocacy group, which campaigns against poverty and preventable diseases, said a failure to do so would deny billions of people essential protection from the COVID-19-causing virus and likely prolong the pandemic.
The report looked specifically at contracts with the 5 leading COVID-19 vaccine makers – Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax.
It found that to date, the United States, the European Union, Britain, Australia, Canada, and Japan have already secured more than 3 billion doses – over a billion more than the 2.06 billion needed to give their entire populations two doses.
“This huge excess is the embodiment of vaccine nationalism,” said Jenny Ottenhoff, ONE Campaign’s senior director for policy.
“Rich countries understandably hedged their bets on vaccines early in the pandemic but with these bets paying off in spades, a massive course correction is needed if we are going to protect billions of people around the world,” she added.
The analysis found that, along with other COVID vaccine supplies procured by the global COVAX vaccine-sharing plan and in bilateral deals, the excess rich-country doses would go a long way to protecting vulnerable people in poorer countries.
This would significantly reduce the risk of deaths from COVID-19, it said, as well as limiting the chances of new virus variants emerging and accelerating an end to the pandemic.
The World Health Organization on Thursday urged nations with vaccines not to share them unilaterally, but to donate them to the global COVAX scheme to ensure fairness.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/researchers-urge-delay-administering-pfizer-vaccine-second-dose/,Researchers urge delaying Pfizer vaccine’s 2nd dose as 1st highly effective,"The second dose of Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine could be delayed in order to cover all priority groups as the first one is highly protective, two Canada-based researchers said in a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The vaccine had an efficacy of 92.6% after the first dose, Danuta Skowronski and Gaston De Serres said, based on an analysis of the documents submitted by the drugmaker to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
These findings were similar to the first-dose efficacy of 92.1% reported for Moderna Inc’s mRNA-1273 vaccine, according to the letter on Wednesday, February 17.
In its response, Pfizer said alternative dosing regimens of the vaccine had not been evaluated yet and that the decision resided with the health authorities.
Some countries, grappling with low supplies, are looking at dosing patterns or volumes that differ from how the vaccines were tested in clinical trials.
There are differences over the merits of such strategies, with some arguing the urgency of the pandemic requires flexibility, while others oppose abandoning data-driven approaches for the sake of expediency.
Skowronski and De Serres cautioned that there may be uncertainty about the duration of protection with a single dose, but said the administration of the second dose a month after the first provided “little added benefit in the short term.”
Skowronski works at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, while De Serres is from the Institut National de Santé Publique du Québec
In Britain, authorities have said that data supported its decision to move to a 12-week dosing schedule for Pfizer’s COVID vaccine. Both Pfizer and partner BioNTech have warned that they had no evidence to prove it.

https://www.rappler.com/environment/pollution/air-pollution-kills-thousands-megacities-despite-covid-19-lockdowns/,Air pollution kills thousands in megacities despite COVID-19 lockdowns,"Air pollution caused tens of thousands of deaths in the world’s 5 most populous cities last year despite coronavirus lockdowns, researchers said on Thursday, February 18, urging governments to ditch fossil fuels and invest in a green recovery.
Environmental campaign group Greenpeace Southeast Asia and air quality technology company IQAir measured pollution levels across 28 cities – chosen according to where data was available and with a geographical spread.
In the 5 most-populated cities – Delhi, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, and Tokyo – air pollution caused about 160,000 deaths and economic losses totalling about $85 billion.
“A few months of lockdown hasn’t really dented that long-term average of air pollution that people have been exposed to,” said Aidan Farrow, an air pollution scientist at Greenpeace Research Laboratories at Britain’s University of Exeter.
“It is a little shocking to see how much upheaval there has been – and we still have work to do to improve air pollution,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Air pollution is the single largest environmental risk to human health globally, and kills an estimated 7 million people every year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
The WHO says 9 out of 10 people breathe polluted air, which is linked to strokes, lung cancer, and heart disease – and now equals the effects of smoking tobacco, health experts say.
The problem affects more cities in Asia than anywhere else in the world. Major causes include vehicle emissions, coal power plants, construction, festival fireworks, forest clearing, and burning of crops, firewood, and waste.
Delhi had the highest death toll among the 5 biggest cities, with some 54,000 deaths – or one per 500 people – due to high levels of tiny pollution particles, known as PM2.5, which can cause lung and heart diseases, the study said.
Japan’s capital Tokyo suffered the highest financial cost with approximately 40,000 deaths and economic losses of $43 billion, it added.
Lockdowns to stem the spread of the new coronavirus in major cities have forced millions to work from home, while slowing economies have slashed carbon dioxide emissions.
“We have seen changes in road traffic, aviation as well…but the major (air pollution) sources have continued to operate largely as before,” Farrow said.
“The problem is vast and needs a big, multi-industry effort to address it,” he added, calling for more investment in cleaner technologies, renewable energy and electrified public transport.",Reuters,"Feb 18, 2021 10:18 AM PHT"

Nations waiting on doses from the COVAX program, co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the GAVI Vaccine Alliance to support poorer countries, can expect a timeline and information on dose amounts in “the next days and weeks,” PAHO Director Carissa Etienne said in a virtual briefing.
About 160 million doses would be distributed in the region in the first 6 months with doses ramping up monthly, Etienne said, adding that a global squeeze on supplies meant initial shipments would be limited.
“Rest assured, PAHO is doing everything it can to expand vaccine availability and to get vaccines out quickly,” Etienne said.
The WHO’s emergency use authorization for the AstraZeneca /Oxford University COVID-19 vaccine from two manufacturers on Monday was a “critical milestone,” Etienne said. Officials are planning to distribute more than 300 million doses of the vaccine to 145 countries through COVAX.
About 63 million people had so far been vaccinated against COVID-19 in the Americas, but that number would need to increase to 700 million in order for the region to achieve 70% inoculation, officials said.
“We urge ministries of health, regulatory agencies, and other officials to review requirements for each COVAX vaccine to avoid delays in shipments,” Etienne said.
There were 1.2 million new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 39,000 related deaths in the last week, a 10% drop from recent weeks. Across North America and Central America, new infections were declining, with the exception of Honduras, Etienne said, which has consistently reported a rise in infections in 2021.",Reuters,"Feb 18, 2021 9:38 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/britain-oks-challenge-trial-exposing-volunteers-covid-19/,"In first for the world, Britain OKs challenge trial exposing volunteers to COVID-19","Britain became the first country in the world on Wednesday, February 17, to give the go-ahead for human challenge trials in which volunteers will deliberately be exposed to COVID-19 to advance research into the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The trial, due to start within a month, will see up to 90 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 30 exposed to the smallest amount of the virus needed to cause infection, scientists behind the plans told reporters at a news briefing.
Volunteers will be screened for possible health risks before being allowed to take part, and kept in quarantine for close monitoring by medical staff for at least 14 days in a specialist unit at London’s Royal Free Hospital.
“The absolute priority, of course, is the safety of volunteers,” said Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, which is co-leading the project with the UK government’s vaccines task force and the clinical company  hVIVO. “None of us wants to do this if there is any appreciable risk.”
Scientists have used human challenge trials for decades to learn more about diseases such as malaria, flu, typhoid and cholera, and to develop treatments and vaccines against them.
Trial participants will be allowed to go home after the initial 14 days only if “extensive testing” shows they are not infectious, said Imperial’s Chris Chiu, the trial’s chief investigator.
The aim of this initial work was “to understand how the virus infects people and how it passes so successfully between us,” Chiu said. Further trials using the challenge models could then be conducted in the months and years ahead to establish which vaccines and treatments work best, he said.
Volunteers will get compensation payments of around £88 ($122)* per day for the duration of the study, which will also involve follow-up monitoring for a year, Chiu’s team said, and the studies will be conducted in a safe and controlled environment and will minimize any risk.

A WHO statement said it had approved the vaccine as produced by AstraZeneca-SKBio (Republic of Korea) and the Serum Institute of India.
“We now have all the pieces in place for the rapid distribution of vaccines. But we still need to scale up production,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
The listing by the UN health agency comes days after a WHO panel provided interim recommendations on the vaccine, saying two doses with an interval of around 8 to 12 weeks must be given to all adults, and can be used in countries with the South African variant of the coronavirus as well.
The AstraZeneca/Oxford shot has been hailed because it is cheaper and easier to distribute than some rivals, including Pfizer/BioNTech’s , which was listed for emergency use by the WHO late in December.
Nearly 109 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and more than 2.5 million have died, according to a Reuters tally.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/difference-between-mutations-variants-strains/,"What’s the difference between mutations, variants, and strains?","Living through a global pandemic over the past year has seen all of us expanding our vocabularies. We now understand terms like PPE, social distancing, and contact tracing.
But just when perhaps we thought we had a handle on most of the terminology, we’re faced with another set of new words: mutation, variant, and strain.
The genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is called ribonucleic acid (RNA). To replicate, and therefore establish infection, SARS-CoV-2 RNA must hijack a host cell and use the cell’s machinery to duplicate itself.
Errors often occur during the process of duplicating the viral RNA. This results in viruses that are similar but not exact copies of the original virus. These errors in the viral RNA are called mutations, and viruses with these mutations are called variants. Variants could differ by a single or many mutations.
Not all mutations have the same effect. To understand this better, we need to understand the basics of our genetic code (DNA for humans; RNA for SARS-CoV-2). This code is like a blueprint on which all organisms are built. When a mutation occurs at a single point, it won’t necessarily change any of the building blocks (called amino acids). In this case, it won’t change how the organism (human or virus) is built.
On occasion though, these single mutations occur in a part of the virus RNA that causes a change in a particular building block. In some cases, there could be many mutations that together alter the building block.
A variant is a referred to as a strain when it shows distinct physical properties. Put simply, a strain is a variant that is built differently, and so behaves differently, to its parent virus. These behavioral differences can be subtle or obvious.
For example, these differences could involve a variant binding to a different cell receptor, or binding more strongly to a receptor, or replicating more quickly, or transmitting more efficiently, and so on.
Essentially, all strains are variants, but not all variants are strains.
Three of the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants are what we’ve come to know as the UK variant (B117), the South African variant (B1351) and the Brazilian variant (P1). Each contains several different mutations.
Let’s look at the UK variant as an example. This variant has a large number of mutations in the spike protein, which aids the virus in its effort to invade human cells.
The increased transmission of the UK variant is believed to be associated with a mutation called N501Y, which allows SARS-CoV-2 to bind more readily to the human receptor ACE2, the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 to a wide range of human cells.
This variant is now widespread in more than 70 countries, and has recently been detected in Australia.
While we commonly call it the “UK variant” (which it is), it’s also a strain because it displays different behaviors to the parental strain.
There is some confusion around how best to use these terms. Given all strains are variants (but not all variants are strains), it makes sense the term variant is more common. But when the science shows these variants behave differently, it would be more accurate to call them strains.
Pleasingly, the World Health Organization and health departments in Australia appear to be using the terms correctly in the context of SARS-CoV-2.
The big question everyone is asking at the moment is how the new variants and strains will affect the efficacy of our COVID vaccines.
The scientific community is uncovering more information about emerging mutations, variants, and strains all the time, and leading vaccine developers are testing and evaluating the efficacy of their vaccines in this light.
Some recently licensed vaccines appear to protect well against the UK variant but recent data from Novavax, Johnson & Johnson, and Oxford/AstraZeneca indicates possible reduced protection against the South African variant.
Health authorities in South Africa recently paused their rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for this reason. However, its too early to tell what impact, if any, this will have on Australia’s vaccine plans.
The vaccine rollout in Australia will assess all information as it comes to light and ensure optimal available protection for the population.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/beijing-smog-lunar-new-year-2021/,Beijing smog casts gloom over China’s Lunar New Year holiday,"Beijing was once again shrouded in smog on Saturday, February 13, after several days of heavy pollution which have plagued China’s capital during the Lunar New Year national holiday.
Visibility across Beijing was severely limited by the smog on the second day of Lunar New Year, with the tops of the city’s Beijing’s tallest group of buildings in the east of the city almost completely covered by the haze.
The PM 2.5 level – which measures pollution – in the city’s urban areas reached 239 micrograms per cubic meter according to state news agency Xinhua.
Local authorities had issued a yellow alert for heavy air pollution on Thursday, February 11. China has a colour-coded, 4-tier warning system for air pollution, with red the most serious, followed by orange, yellow and blue.
“The air is horrible,” said cosmetics sector worker Katie Li, 35, as she made her way to the gym.” “Starting the Lunar New Year with this kind of weather is a bit depressing,” she added.
Staff at the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall of China in the north of Beijing said that they had received around 5,000 visitors on Saturday, a far cry from their usual daily capacity of 20,000 although they have capped numbers to around half of that due to COVID-19 restrictions.
Some visitors complained about the haze affecting the views. But others, such as 32-year-old banking sector worker Brandon Chen, were unfazed by the conditions.
“Even though the air isn’t great, for Chinese people walking up to a high point in the new year carries a lot of importance,” Chen said.

Trust in vaccines in Japan is among the lowest in the world, a study by the Lancet medical journal showed. Only half the population want to take a COVID-19 vaccine, a poll by national broadcaster NHK found last month.
It is among the last major economies to begin its COVID-19 vaccination campaign, which is seen as vital for preparations for the Olympic Games, due to open in fewer than 200 days, after being postponed in 2020 as the coronavirus spread.
The government is expected to approve Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine this weekend, and begin shots almost immediately, prioritising front-line health workers.
While the anti-vaccine movement in the United States is relatively new and driven largely by fears of autism, vaccine hesitancy in Japan stems from vague safety concerns going back decades.
Unproven reports of side effects halted active inoculation campaigns for mumps in the early 1990s and HPV in 2013.
Officials are counting on a generally high degree of compliance with medical directives that carry the government’s stamp of approval.
But with waning support for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s administration, partly over its handling of the pandemic, an enthusiastic take-up of the shots remains uncertain.
“In Japan, I would say that trust in the government can directly be associated with trust in vaccines,” said Yuji Yamada, a doctor at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.
“It can still go both ways at this point,” said Yamada, one of the 10 young Japanese physicians who helped create the dog chatbot to spread lessons learned from overseas vaccination efforts and to counter social media rumours.
Vaccine tsar Taro Kono, who has posted a video in which he talks frankly about possible side effects of coronavirus vaccines, promoted the cheerful dog chatbot on Twitter last week.
The dog, a Shiba-inu known as Corowa-kun– from the Japanese words for “coronavirus” and “vaccine” –wears a white doctor’s coat and the app named for him gives automated answers to medical questions.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/uk-mutating-variant-concern-might-undermine-vaccines/,"UK’s mutating variant a concern as it might undermine vaccines, scientist says","The coronavirus variant first found in the British region of Kent is a concern because it is mutating and so could undermine the protection given by vaccines against developing COVID-19, the head of the UK’s genetic surveillance program said.
She also said the British variant was dominant in the country and was likely “to sweep the world, in all probability.”
The coronavirus has killed 2.35 million people and turned normal life upside down for billions, but a few new worrying variants out of thousands have raised fears that vaccines will need to be tweaked and people may require booster shots.
Sharon Peacock, director of the COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium, said vaccines were so far effective against the variants in the United Kingdom, but that mutations could potentially undermine the shots.
“What’s concerning about this is that the 117 variant that we have had circulating for some weeks and months is beginning to mutate again and get new mutations which could affect the way that we handle the virus in terms of immunity and effectiveness of vaccines,” Peacock told the BBC.
“It’s concerning that the 117, which is more transmissible, which has swept the country, is now mutating to have this new mutation that could threaten vaccination.”
That new mutation, first identified in Bristol in southwest England, has been designated a “Variant of Concern,” by the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group.
Britain’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said the Bristol variant had one of the same mutations as the South African. “It is not surprising that it has happened and it will happen elsewhere as well,” he said on Wednesday.
“In getting that variant it does make it slightly more likely to look different to the immune system so we need to watch out for it, we need to measure it, we need to keep on top of it and need to keep testing the vaccine effects in this situation.”
There are so far 21 cases of that variant which has E484K mutation, which occurs on the spike protein of the virus, the same change as has been seen in the South African and Brazilian variants.
“One has to be a realist that this particular mutation has arisen in our kind of communal garden lineage now, at least 5 times – 5 separate times. And so this is going to keep popping up,” Peacock said.
British people should expect to receive repeated vaccinations against COVID-19 in future to keep pace with mutations of the virus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday.
There are 3 major known variants that are worrying scientists: the South African variant, known by scientists as 20I/501Y.V2 or B1351; the British variant known as 20I/501Y.V1 or B117; and the Brazilian variant known as P1.
The British variant, which is more infectious but not necessarily more deadly than others, was likely “to sweep the world,” Peacock said.
“Once we get on top of (the virus) or it mutates itself out of being virulent – causing disease – then we can stop worrying about it. But I think, looking in the future, we’re going to be doing this for years. We’re still going to be doing this 10 years down the line, in my view.”

The two-dose inoculation, developed with Oxford University, has been hailed as a “vaccine for the world” because it is cheaper and easier to distribute than some rivals.
But its rapid approval in Europe and elsewhere has been clouded by doubts over its most effective dosage and interval between doses.
Data at the weekend also showed it was less effective against a fast-spreading variant of the virus in South Africa, prompting the country to pause rollout of the shot, and the company has also been embroiled in a row with the European Union over supply delays.
“Is it perfect? No, it’s not perfect, but it’s great. Who else is making 100 million doses in February?” CEO Pascal Soriot said on a conference call about the vaccine.
“We’re going to save thousands of lives and that’s why we come to work every day.”
The company said it aimed to produce more than 200 million doses per month by April, double this month’s level as the world tries to tame a pandemic that has killed 2.35 million.
Head of operations Pam Cheng said on the call that the group was working to further expand global capacity and productivity.
AstraZeneca has set a target to produce 3 billion doses this year, with India’s Serum Institute making much of that aimed at poorer nations.
On Wednesday, February 10, the company enlisted Germany’s IDT Biologika as a contract manufacturer, but the bulk of IDT’s contribution will only come onstream late next year.
AstraZeneca said it expected much-anticipated data from the US trial of the vaccine before the end of March, and that it was confident the shot offered relatively good protection against severe disease and death for the South African variant. Its disappointing results were against milder cases.
However, after rising to become Britain’s most valuable company last summer, the company has now slipped to sixth, in a move some analysts attribute to doubts over the vaccine.
“In a year or two we will look back and everybody will realize we made a big impact,” Soriot said.
AstraZeneca’s shares were up 0.95% in afternoon trade, paring some earlier gains, after the company forecast a pick up in earnings growth this year on strong demand for its cancer and other new therapies.
It has pledged not to make any money from its COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic.
It has been a tumultuous week for the drugmaker after South Africa put on hold giving the shot to its citizens, choosing one developed by its US rival Johnson & Johnson instead.
That came after the trial data raised concerns about the AstraZeneca vaccine’s effectiveness on mild symptoms from the more infectious 501Y.V2 variant of the virus dominant in South Africa, which has spread to 41 nations around the world.
Despite that blow, the World Health Organization endorsed the British vaccine on Wednesday and the African Union said it would target its use in countries that have not reported cases of the variant.
Kenya and Morocco are also planning to administer it.
AstraZeneca said it expected 2021 revenues to rise by a low teens percentage and core earnings of $4.75 to $5.00 per share, as it beat expectations for fourth-quarter sales.
The earnings guidance equates to 18-24% growth, after 15% in 2020, but was a little lower than the $5.10 per share analysts were expecting, as the company flagged more spending this year.
The COVID-19 vaccine is not included in the guidance and the company said its sales would be reported separately from the first quarter of 2021.
While public interest is focused on the vaccine, AstraZeneca’s core business of diabetes, heart, kidney, and cancer medicines has been steadily growing, helping the company to turn around years of decline.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Wednesday, February 10, the vaccines have been shown to prevent symptomatic COVID-19, thought to play a greater role in the transmission of the virus than asymptomatic disease.
“Individual and societal benefits of avoiding unnecessary quarantine may outweigh the potential but unknown risk of transmission (among vaccinated individuals),” the CDC said.
The agency has laid down strict criteria for people who would no longer have to quarantine after the vaccinations, including having received both doses of a two-dose vaccine.
People who choose not to quarantine should do so only if they received their last dose within 3 months, and should only avoid 14 days quarantine after their last shot, the time it takes to develop immunity, CDC said.
Fully vaccinated persons who do not quarantine should still watch for symptoms for 14 days following an exposure.

Health authorities in Australia’s Victoria state ramped up contact tracing and prepared for more mass testing of residents in Melbourne after a new COVID-19 cluster linked to a quarantine hotel grew to 10 cases on Thursday.
More than 22,500 test results were conducted in the past 24 hours in Australia’s second most populous city Melbourne and authorities urged residents to get tested amid fears of community transmission from a worker at the Holiday Inn in the city.
The latest outbreak was likely sparked by a medical device known as a nebuliser being used by a COVID-positive guest at the hotel.
Making sure a mask fits snugly on the face and use of two masks is likely to significantly reduce a person’s exposure to the coronavirus, US health officials on Wednesday said laboratory experiments showed.
The combination of a cloth mask over a three-ply medical procedure mask blocked 92.5% of the cough particles, the experiments conducted by the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in January showed.
Re-useable devices known as mask-fitters were also an option to improve a mask’s fit, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters.
AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective and should be deployed widely, including in countries where the South African variant of the coronavirus may reduce its efficacy, a World Health Organization panel said on Wednesday.
In interim recommendations on the shot, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) panel said the vaccine should be given in two doses with an interval of 8 to 12 weeks, and should also be used in people aged 65 and older.
“We have thousands of people dying from the infection, in many countries of the world, daily,” Alejandro Cravioto, chair of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) panel, said. “Anything we can do to use a product that might reduce that is totally justified.”
An experimental antiviral drug significantly sped up the time it took to “clear” the virus in COVID-19 patients who did not need to be hospitalized, Toronto researchers have found in a report published on Friday in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.
In a small trial, patients who received a single injection of peginterferon-lambda were more than four times as likely to test negative for the virus within seven days as patients who received a placebo.
Respiratory symptoms also appeared to resolve faster with peginterferon-lambda therapy, but the trial was too small to demonstrate a statistically significant difference. The team is planning a much larger trial, and studies are already underway testing the treatment in hospitalized patients.

The U.S. administration is looking forward to scrutinizing data included in a World Health Organization (WHO) report released on Tuesday, February 9, that said the COVID-19 virus did not originate in a laboratory in Wuhan, China, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.
The head of a WHO-led team investigating the origins of COVID-19 said bats remained a likely source and that transmission of the virus via frozen food was a possibility that warranted further investigation.
He ruled out a lab leak.
Separately, a US official told a WHO meeting on Tuesday that the United States would join a program to boost COVID-19 testing, diagnostics and vaccines as officials urged it to increase financing for a global response to the pandemic.
Two new COVID-19 variants, one of which has been classified as a “concern”, have been identified in England with some similarities to the South African and Brazilian variants, a government advisory scientific committee said on Tuesday.
The new variants, first identified in Bristol and Liverpool, have the E484K mutation, which occurs on the spike protein of the virus, which is the same change as has been seen in the South African and Brazilian variants that have caused international concern.
The Australian state of Victoria is considering making N95 masks mandatory for quarantine hotels and will also ban nebulizer machines for inhaling medication at them, after a cluster of 3 cases was linked to a hotel.
Victoria state chief health officer Brett Sutton said the working hypothesis was the new cases came from “an exposure event that involved a medical device called a nebulizer and it vaporizes medication or liquid into a fine mist”. The mist can remain suspended in the air for several minutes, Sutton said.
When it comes to protecting yourself against new coronavirus variants, two masks may be better than one. But doctors, as well as public health professionals, say any protection is better than none.
“The right kind of mask is one that is worn consistently over the nose and mouth whenever you are in a public space,” said Dr Matt Binnicker, president of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology. “At this point, we should focus more on achieving that goal than worrying about double-masking.”

More than 45,000 people have died as of late Tuesday from COVID-19 in California, the most populous of the 50 states and one of the hardest hit in recent months. New York, severely stricken in the early stages of pandemic last spring, has reported 44,693 lives lost, according to a Reuters tally.
“This is a heart-wrenching reminder that COVID-19 is a deadly virus, and we mourn alongside every Californian who has suffered the tragic loss of a loved one during this pandemic,” Dr Mark Ghaly, the state’s health secretary, said of the milestone in an email to Reuters.
California, home to some 40 million people, emerged as a main US epicenter of the pandemic during a year-end surge of infections and hospitalizations that swept much of the country, pushing many healthcare systems to their limits.
When considered in terms of per capita deaths, California, with 113 deaths per 100,000 people, ranks 32nd in the nation in COVID-19 mortality. By comparison, New York, with 248 deaths per 100,000, ranks second only to New Jersey, which has logged about 230 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 residents.
Nationwide, the daily tallies of new cases and hospitalizations from COVID-19 have been dropping steadily in recent weeks, while deaths, a lagging indicator, have plateaued.
The United States as a whole has reported 27.25 million infections and 468,559 deaths, as of late Tuesday. Just over 79,000 US patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 on Tuesday, the lowest daily number since mid-November.
But in California, as in other states, the improvement obscures a march of illness, hospitalizations and deaths, which remain far higher than they were at the pandemic’s previous peak last summer.
The number of lives lost reported daily in the state has declined over the past several weeks, but remains “remarkably” high at an average of 500 fatalities per day over the past 14 days, Governor Gavin Newsom told a news conference.
“Deaths continue to be devastating,” Newsom said, speaking at the opening of a vaccination site at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara County near San Francisco.
Public health experts fear that gatherings for Super Bowl celebrations on Sunday, as well as the arrival of new, highly contagious variants of the virus may lead to another surge in cases before most Americans are vaccinated.
In an effort to speed up the immunization campaign being counted on to halt the pandemic, President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced that his administration planned to increase the number of vaccine doses shipped to the states, beginning on February 15.
Part of the expanded supply will be sent to community health centers in an effort to improve vaccine access for the mostly poor and minority populations those centers serve, the White House said on Tuesday.

A number of politicians, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Senator Mitt Romney, have been spotted doubling up on face masks, and top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci has recommended that everyday Americans do the same.
As part of our #AskReuters Twitter chat series, Reuters gathered a group of health experts to answer questions about the coronavirus, including what they consider the “right” way to wear face coverings.
Doctors, as well as public health professionals, said any protection is better than none.
“The right kind of mask is one that is worn consistently over the nose and mouth whenever you are in a public space,” said Dr Matt Binnicker, president of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology. “At this point, we should focus more on achieving that goal than worrying about double-masking.”
If you do opt to layer your masks, here are some tips to consider.
The type and number of masks you need will depend on where you are going, according to Dr Josh Schiffer, professor at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
“It is most critical to mask effectively and consistently when in the highest-risk environments for super spreader events,” he said.
Schiffer recommends wearing a cloth mask when walking the dog, for example, and upgrading to a KN95, N95, or double masks when going to the office, grocery store, or clinic.
“If properly worn, all masks are effective,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. But the material and fit of a mask can make a bigger difference than the number you wear.
“Double masking is vague because we don’t know what kind of material or fitting,” Gostin said, noting that surgical masks and KN95s perform better.
The experts agreed that an effective face mask should have multiple layers. “At this time, the CDC recommends wearing one face mask with two to 3 layers,” said Dr Raed Dweik, chair of Cleveland Clinic’s Respiratory Institute. “If your mask already has multiple layers, it is not necessary to double mask.”
When double masking, Dr Charles Holmes, director of the Center for Innovation in Global Health at Georgetown University, recommends wearing the most effective one on the inside. For example, you should wear a surgical mask over a KN95 mask, or a cloth mask over a surgical mask.
However, Holmes’ biggest piece of advice is simply to cover your face, no matter what that looks like.
“The best mask is a mask you wear consistently and properly,” he said.",Reuters,"Feb 10, 2021 9:03 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/who-official-leading-wuhan-covid-19-probe-says-cold-chain-transmission-possible/,"COVID-19 may have taken ‘convoluted path’ to Wuhan, WHO team leader says","The head of a World Health Organization-led team probing the origins of COVID-19 said bats remain a likely source and that transmission of the virus via frozen food is a possibility that warrants further investigation, but he ruled out a lab leak.
Peter Ben Embarek, who led the team of independent experts in its nearly month-long visit to the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak first emerged at a seafood market in late 2019, said the team’s work had uncovered new information but had not dramatically changed their picture of the outbreak.
“The possible path from whatever original animal species all the way through to the Huanan market could have taken a very long and convoluted path involving also movements across borders,” Embarek told a nearly three-hour media briefing.
Embarek said work to identify the coronavirus’s origins points to a natural reservoir in bats, but it is unlikely that they were in Wuhan.
Investigators were also looking for Chinese blood samples that could indicate that the virus was circulating earlier than first thought, he said.
“In trying to understand the picture of December 2019 we embarked on a very detailed and profound search for other cases that may have been missed, cases earlier on in 2019,” he said.
“And the conclusion was we did not find evidence of large outbreaks that could be related to cases of COVID-19 prior to December 2019 in Wuhan or elsewhere.”
The possibility the virus leaked from a lab – which has been the subject of conspiracy theories – was extremely unlikely and did not require further study, Embarek said.
Liang Wannian, head of China’s expert panel on the outbreak, said there was evidence of coronavirus infections that could have preceded the first detected case by “several weeks.”
“This suggests that we cannot rule out that it was circulating in other regions and the circulation was unreported,” he told the briefing.
Embarek said the team had identified market vendors selling frozen animal products including farmed wild animals.
“So there is the potential to continue to follow this lead and further look at the supply chain and animals that were supplied to the market,” he said.
China has pushed the idea that the virus can be transmitted by frozen food and has repeatedly announced findings of coronavirus traces on imported food packaging.
“We know the virus can survive in conditions that are found in these cold, frozen environments, but we don’t really understand if the virus can transmit to humans” or under which conditions, Embarek told the briefing.
The team arrived in Wuhan on January 14 and after two weeks of quarantine, visited key sites including the Huanan seafood market, the location of the first known cluster of infections, as well as the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has been involved in coronavirus research.
Members of the team sought to rein in expectations for the mission, with infectious disease expert Dominic Dwyer saying it would probably take years to fully understand the origins of COVID-19.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/coronavirus-might-become-endemic-conversation/,Coronavirus might become endemic – here’s how,"Endemic viruses are those that have constant presence within a geographical area. Such viruses are all around us, though they vary by location. Examples in Europe and North America include the rhinovirus (a cause of the common cold) and influenza virus, while the dengue and chikungunya viruses are endemic in many Asian countries.
Endemic diseases are often milder, but it’s important to note that this isn’t always the case. Flu, for instance, is estimated to cause up to 810,000 hospitalizations and 61,000 deaths annually in the US.
There are currently four endemic coronaviruses that, for most people, just cause a cold. Whether SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, will join them will be down to two predominant factors that control how a virus behaves in a population: the virus’s biology and the immunity of the host population.
Despite knowing a lot about the biology of endemic viruses around today, it’s very difficult to work out where they actually came from. Did they always cause these persistent milder illnesses or did they evolve from more severe precursors?
Viruses replicate really quickly – after entering a host cell, many produce new virus particles within hours. Due to the speed of this process, mistakes are often made in the copying of their genetic material, resulting in mutations.
Many of these mutations will result in non-viable viruses, unable to infect or replicate. But a small number of these mutations might result in an advantageous change. For example, they may allow the virus to get into host cells quicker or make the jump to a new, different host.
It’s important to remember these mutations are chance events. Viruses cannot actively decide to mutate or make conscious decisions as to where mutations occur.
Once an advantageous mutation arises, viruses with it can quickly out-compete other versions of the virus to become the dominant form in the population. This is what we think we’re currently seeing with the UK variant, which computer modeling suggests has an increased ability to bind to host cells.
We can track mutations in current outbreaks, as scientists across the world are regularly recording and analyzing the genetic material of virus populations using a process called genomic sequencing.
However, looking back to determine how today’s endemic viruses changed to take their current genetic form is almost impossible, as it requires looking at the genomes of viruses that no are no longer in circulation. Some historic viruses have been sequenced in the past, but it is rare to find samples well preserved enough to do this – and besides, this gives us more of a snapshot of the virus at a specific time rather than a detailed look back.
Alternatively, we can look at the genetic material of known viruses now and compare them to each other to try to work backwards to see where certain mutations and strains arose. For instance, the similarity between the endemic coronavirus HCoV-043 and its bovine counterpart, BCoV, implies that the human virus made the jump from cattle. Coupled with historical records, this has led some scientists to propose that the now-endemic HCoV-043 was the cause of a pandemic in the late 1800s.
There is no direct evidence that pathogens mutate to lose virulence over time, and there is no set roadmap of mutations that allow a virus to become endemic. However, we do know that SARS-CoV-2 is mutating. It’s plausible, but not certain, that it could acquire mutations that help it survive in human populations long term.
This is especially true now our immune systems are becoming better trained against SARS-CoV-2 from exposure to the virus and vaccination. Our immune systems have evolved for millennia to effectively ward off infections and are now in an evolutionary arms race with SARS-CoV-2. In particular, our “adaptive” immune system evolves each time we encounter new germs (or have a vaccine) to produce specific and effective antibodies.
Pandemics and sporadic outbreaks occur most often in populations where people have no existing defenses to a new disease, often resulting in severe illness and quick spread. But for most endemic diseases, because the germs that cause them regularly circulate, the population as a whole tends to have some existing immunity. This can prevent symptoms from occurring completely or result in diseases being more mild, as the immune system limits the damage caused by a virus.
With COVID-19, it seems that children have milder illness, while more severe disease tends to appear in people over 60. Given this, if lots of people develop immunity early in life (whether via infection or vaccination), over time this could tip the balance towards SARS-CoV-2 being a mild illness if we assume that young people retain some level of immunity throughout life.
As researchers have suggested, using modeling from immunological data to the four existing endemic coronaviruses, it might be possible that we reach a point where everyone is first exposed to the virus in childhood, resulting in COVID-19 infections in later life becoming no worse than the common cold. But it’s important to note that this is still very much hypothetical.
It’s also very important to stress that deliberately infecting people (or actively encouraging infections) would be reckless – we shouldn’t be advocating for young people to catch the virus. We don’t know the long-term effects of COVID-19, or how long immunity to SARS-CoV-2 lasts (either from infection or vaccination). There’s also no guarantee that the disease would become less severe if it did become endemic.
Also, why aim for an endemic virus when we could aim for no virus, using widespread vaccination strategies? The most ethical, practical and safe way to reduce the threat of SARS-CoV-2 is to vaccinate as much of the population as possible – including children. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/astrazeneca-covid-shot-less-effective-against-south-african-variant-study/,AstraZeneca COVID shot less effective against South African variant – study,"British drugmaker AstraZeneca said on Saturday, February 6, its vaccine developed with the University of Oxford appeared to offer only limited protection against mild disease caused by the South African variant of COVID-19, based on early data from a trial.
The study from South Africa’s University of the Witwatersrand and Oxford University showed the vaccine had significantly reduced efficacy against the South African variant, according to a Financial Times report published earlier in the day.
Among coronavirus variants currently most concerning for scientists and public health experts are the so-called British, South African and Brazilian variants, which appear to spread more swiftly than others.
“In this small phase I/II trial, early data has shown limited efficacy against mild disease primarily due to the B1351 South African variant,” an AstraZeneca spokesman said in response to the FT report.
The newspaper said none of the more than 2,000 trial participants had been hospitalized or died.
“However, we have not been able to properly ascertain its effect against severe disease and hospitalization given that subjects were predominantly young healthy adults,” the AstraZeneca spokesman said.
The company said it believed its vaccine could protect against severe disease, given that the neutralizing antibody activity was equivalent to that of other COVID-19 vaccines that have demonstrated protection against severe disease.
The trial, which involved 2,026 people of whom half formed the placebo group, has not been peer-reviewed, the FT said.
While thousands of individual changes have arisen as the virus mutates into new variants, only a tiny minority are likely to be important or change the virus in an appreciable way, according to the British Medical Journal.
“Oxford University and AstraZeneca have started adapting the vaccine against this variant and will advance rapidly through clinical development so that it is ready for Autumn delivery should it be needed,” the AstraZeneca spokesman said.
On Friday, February 5, Oxford said their vaccine has similar efficacy against the British coronavirus variant as it does to the previously circulating variants.",Reuters,"Feb 7, 2021 10:46 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/wuhan-residents-remember-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-a-year-after-his-death/,Wuhan residents remember coronavirus ‘whistleblower’ doctor a year after his death,"A year after his death from COVID-19, residents in the Chinese city of Wuhan say they remain grateful to the “whistleblower” doctor who first sounded the alarm about the outbreak before it received official recognition.
Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at a hospital in the city, became one of the most visible figures in the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan when he tried to sound the alarm about its appearance, but was reprimanded by police for “spreading rumors.”
The 34-year-old’s death from the virus on February 7 led to an outpouring of public mourning and rare expressions of anger online.
We should be commemorating his contribution to fighting the pandemic.
Qian Wende, 80-year-old resident of Wuhan
Several days later Zhong Nanshan, a renowned epidemiologist, shed tears for Li in an interview with Reuters, calling him a “hero of China.”
But when President Xi Jinping honored the “heroes” of the “people’s war” against the virus in September, there was no mention of Li’s contribution.
While people on the streets around Li’s hospital say life in the city has mostly returned to its usual rhythm, they still revere Li for his actions.
As Reuters journalists visited the area around the hospital on Saturday they were followed by two men in plainclothes who identified themselves as “hospital parking security,” and local guards blocked a cameraman from filming the hospital entrance.
“He was the first to tell us about the virus,” said Li Pan, 24, who owns an online store.
“He must have considered the impact would be huge, but he still raised the alarm. That was really brave,” Li said.
Ji Penghui, a 34 year-old designer, said he heard about Li’s warning in the early days and rushed to stock up on masks before the officials spoke openly about the virus.
“The public strongly acknowledges him, and personally, I think he should receive more official honors, rather than being treated as what he did is already in the past” Ji said.
Ji said the government made mistakes in the early stages, but it has handled it well since.
A World Health Organization team is currently in Wuhan researching the early stages of the outbreak, and is preparing to present its findings, team member Dominic Dwyer told Reuters on Friday.
The team visited the sprawling Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, thought to be where the virus first became an outbreak, which led to a pandemic that has infected over 105 million people and killed nearly 3 million worldwide.
The market site has been shut to the public since the beginning of last year.
The origins of the virus have become highly politicized, and some Chinese diplomats and state media have thrown support behind theories that the virus potentially originated in another country.
While 80-year-old Qian Wende said he does not know where the virus came from, he regards Li as a hero.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/china-approves-sinovac-biotech-covid-19-vaccine-general-public-use/,China approves Sinovac Biotech COVID-19 vaccine for general public use,"Sinovac Biotech said on Saturday, February 6, that its unit’s COVID-19 vaccine has been formally approved for use by the general public by China’s medical products regulator.
It marks the second COVID-19 vaccine green-lighted for public use in China, after a shot developed by a Beijing institute affiliated to state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) was approved in December.
Prior to the approvals, both vaccines have already been used in China’s vaccination program mainly targeting key groups deemed to be at higher risk of exposure to the virus.
Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, and Laos have granted emergency authorizations for the CoronaVac vaccine developed by Sinovac Life Sciences, Sinovac said in a news release.
Approval of the two-dose regimen by China’s National Medical Products Administration is based on the results from two months of late-stage clinical trials overseas, from which the final analysis data has not yet been obtained, Sinovac said.
Sinovac Life Sciences is expected to be able to produce over 1 billion doses per year in the form of bulk ingredient by February, it said in a statement.
It is expanding its capacity to fill vaccine into vials and syringes, which currently lags its vaccine manufacturing capacity.
Sinovac’s vaccine is being tested in Phase III clinical trials in countries including Brazil, Turkey, and Indonesia, where varied efficacy readings had been released separately.
The vaccine was found 50.65% effective against COVID-19 disease in the Brazil trial which had recruited 12,396 health workers older than 18 as of December 16 and recorded 253 cases, Sinovac said in a statement on Friday, February 5.
The success rate from the Turkey trial was 91.25%, local researchers said, based on a preliminary analysis of 29 cases. There was a 65.3% efficacy rate in the Indonesia trial.
Brazil’s more rampant epidemic, and the trial’s focus on medical workers, are factors that Sinovac believe may have lowered the efficacy rate seen in data from there, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters last month.
The Brazil trial also found the vaccine was 83.7% effective against the disease that requires medical treatment, and 100% effective against hospitalization, severe cases, and death in the same trial, Sinovac said on Friday.
The protection rate was nearly 70% based on observation of a smaller sub-group in the Brazil trial, in which participants received the two doses at a three-week interval rather than two weeks apart for most participants, Sinovac said last month.",Reuters,"Feb 6, 2021 5:26 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/fecal-microbe-transplants-help-cancer-patients-respond-immunotherapy-shrink-tumors-the-conversation/,Fecal microbe transplants help cancer patients respond to immunotherapy and shrink tumors,"The effect of a drug, or impact of a treatment like chemotherapy, doesn’t just depend on your body. The success of a particular medicine also depends on the trillions of bacteria in your gut.
The 100 trillion bacteria that live within the human digestive tract – known as the human gut microbiome – help us extract nutrients from food, boost the immune response and modulate the effects of drugs. Recent research, including my own, has implicated the gut microbiome in seemingly unconnected states, ranging from the response to cancer treatments to obesity and a host of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, depression, schizophrenia and autism.
What underlies these apparently discrete observations is the unifying idea that the gut microbiota send signals beyond the gut and that these signals have broad effects on a large swathe of target tissues.
I am a medical oncologist whose research involves developing novel therapies for melanoma. To evaluate whether altering the microbiome could benefit cancer patients, my colleagues and I evaluated the transfer of fecal matter from melanoma patients who responded well to immunotherapy to those patients for whom immunotherapy failed. Just published in the journal Science, our results reveal that this treatment helped shrink the tumors of advanced melanoma patients when other therapies hadn’t worked.
Gut microbiota have been linked to to the success and failure of multiple cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab. In the more recent studies, the species and relative populations of gut bacteria determined the probability that a cancer patient would respond to drugs known as “immune checkpoint inhibitors.”
This research showed that differences in the gut microbiome between individual patients were associated with various outcomes to these drugs. But the precise mechanisms underlying microbiome-immune interactions remain unclear.
We chose stool from patients who responded well to immunotherapy based on the hunch that they would have greater quantities of bacteria implicated in helping shrink the cancer. As it is difficult to identify one or two species of bacteria that are responsible for the beneficial response to these therapies, we used the entire bacterial community – hence fecal microbe transplant.
Transplant recipients were patients whose melanoma had never responded to immunotherapy. Both recipients and donors underwent screening for diseases to ensure that no infectious agents would be transmitted during the transplant. Following a biopsy of their tumor, patients received a fecal microbe transplant from patients who benefited from immunotherapy along with a drug called called pembrolizumab, which was continued every three weeks.
My colleagues and I assessed the fecal microbe transplant 12 weeks after the treatment. Patients whose cancers had shrunk or remained the same size after the fecal microbe transplant continued to receive pembrolizumab for up to two years.
Following this fecal microbe transplant treatment, tumors of six out of 15 patients in the study had tumors that shrank or remained the same. The treatment was well tolerated, though some of the patients experienced minor side effects including fatigue.
When we analyzed the gut microbiota of treated patients, we observed that the 6 patients whose cancers had stabilized or improved showed increased numbers of bacteria that had previously been associated with responses to immunotherapy.
My colleagues and I also analyzed the blood and tumors from responders. In doing so, we observed that the responders had lower levels of adverse immune cells termed myeloid cells, and higher levels of memory immune cells. Additionally, by analyzing proteins in the blood serum of treated patients, we observed reductions in levels of key immune system molecules associated with resistance in responders.
These results suggest that introducing certain intestinal microorganisms into a patient’s colon may help the patient respond to drugs that enhance the immune system’s ability to recognize and kill tumor cells.
Ultimately we hope to move beyond fecal microbe transplants to specific collections of microbes in cancers besides melanoma, paving the way for standardized microbe-based drug therapy to treat immunotherapy-resistant tumors.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/uk-regulators-extra-astrazeneca-vaccine-data-highlights-efficacy-elderly/,UK regulators say extra AstraZeneca vaccine data highlights efficacy in elderly,"British regulators have received extra trial data from AstraZeneca that supports their view that the COVID-19 vaccine developed with Oxford University is effective in the elderly, a vaccines official said on Friday, February 5.
Britain has been rolling out the shot among all age groups after the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was the first regulator to approve it in December, but some other European countries have said more data is needed before it is given to those over 65.
Munir Pirmohamed, Chair of the Commission on Human Medicines’ COVID-19 Vaccines Benefit Risk Expert Working Group said British regulators had noticed the smaller number of under-65s in the data when they approved the vaccine.
“Nevertheless, there was no evidence (to suggest) that those people over 65 were not getting evidence of efficacy,” he said at an MHRA news briefing, asked by Reuters about efficacy of the shot in the elderly.
“Since then we’ve seen more data coming through from AstraZeneca as more people are completing the trial, which highlights again that efficacy in the elderly is seen, and there’s no evidence of lack of efficacy.”
He added elderly people were generating strong immune responses, and said that the most important thing was that both AstraZeneca’s vaccine and a shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech were preventing serious disease and deaths.
President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has said that the EU has decided not to compromise on safety as she defends the slower pace of approval of shots in the bloc.
Asked about the suggestion that Britain had compromised on safety and efficacy standards, MHRA Chief Executive June Raine defended the regulator’s standards.
“I think our position is very clear in terms of the rigorous science that MHRA pursues in the interests of public confidence, public safety, and the effectiveness of these important vaccines,” she said.

Britain’s hotel quarantine policy for travellers arriving from COVID-19 hot spots will start on February 15, the government announced on Thursday, February 4, after critics said it was not moving fast enough to bring in the measure.
A mandatory 10-day stay in government-provided accommodation, first announced last month, is designed to tighten borders against new variants of the coronavirus which could endanger Britain’s vaccination programme.
The number of COVID-19 infections in Tokyo may have jumped nine-fold since the summer, coronavirus antibody tests showed, as Japan tries to rein in its third and most lethal wave of the pandemic ahead of the Olympics in July.
Random testing on people in the capital in December showed that 0.91% had antibodies to the virus, compared with about 0.1% in a similar study in June, the health ministry said in a report on Friday. The study sampled more than 15,000 people and also showed increases in antibody rates in Osaka and Miyagi Prefecture.
A South Korean advisory board has recommended caution over the use of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine for people over the age of 65 due to the lack of sufficient data, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said on Friday.
When approved, it will be the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved for emergency use in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, which has been trying to contain its latest wave of infections. South Korea signed a deal in December with AstraZeneca to secure 20 million doses of its vaccine, with the first shipment expected this month.
New Zealand said on Friday it will start receiving refugees again this month, nearly a year after it shut its borders to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A group of 35 refugees will arrive in February, with about 210 expected to enter by June 30, Immigration New Zealand and officials said. All arrivals will have to complete a 14-day stay in government managed isolation facilities.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is planning a rapid review process for quick turnaround of new COVID-19 booster shots if variants of the coronavirus emerge against which the vaccines do not provide protection, the agency’s top official said.
The agency plans to issue a proposal on the process for public comment in a few weeks, Dr Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the FDA, said during a press briefing. The process will likely require safety information as well as, if possible, the convening of an outside committee of experts to review the booster shot.",Reuters,"Feb 5, 2021 2:48 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/vaccine-passports-path-back-to-normality-or-problem-in-the-making/,Vaccine passports: Path back to normality or problem in the making?,"Governments and developers around the world are exploring the potential use of “vaccine passports” as a way of reopening the economy by identifying those protected against the coronavirus.
Those developing the technologies however, say such tools come with consequences such as potentially excluding whole groups from social participation, and are urging lawmakers to think seriously about how they are used.
The travel and entertainment industries, which have struggled to operate at a profit while imposing social distancing regulations, are particularly interested in a way of swiftly checking who has protection.
Among those developing passports are biometrics company iProov and cyber security firm Mvine which have built a vaccine pass now being tested within Britain’s National Health Service after receiving UK government funding.
iProov founder and chief executive Andrew Bud believes such vaccine passports only really need to hold two pieces of information.
“One is, has this person been vaccinated? And the other is, what does this person look like?”
You need only match a face to a vaccination status, you don’t need to know a person’s identity, he added.
Confirmation of patrons’ vaccination status could help the night-time economy, which employs some 420,000 people in the northern English city of Manchester, off its knees, experts say.
“We have to look at how to get back to normal,” said Sacha Lord, an industry adviser and co-founder of the city’s Parklife music festival.
While there have been experiments in socially distanced concerts and events over the last year, they weren’t financially viable, he said.
“A gig isn’t a gig or a festival isn’t a festival unless you are stood shoulder to shoulder with your friends.
“I don’t think we should be forcing people into the vaccine passports. It should be a choice. But on entry, if you don’t have that passport, then we will give you another option,” he added, suggesting the use of rapid result coronavirus tests.
Bud said vaccine certificates were being rolled out in some countries, and in the United Sates, some private sector health passes were being used to admit customers to sports events.
“I think vaccine certificates raise huge social and political issues. Our job is to provide the technology basis for making vaccine passports and certificates possible … It is not our place to make judgments about whether they are a good idea or not,” he said.
Potential issues could arise around discrimination, privilege and exclusion of the younger generation who would be last in line to be vaccinated, he said, adding he believed government was giving it careful consideration.",Reuters,"Feb 4, 2021 5:41 PM PHT"

Thousands of variants of the type of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 have been documented as the virus mutates, including the so-called British, South African and Brazilian variants which appear to spread more swiftly than others.
“Its very unlikely that the current vaccine won’t be effective on the variants whether in Kent or other variants especially when it comes to severe illness and hospitalization,” Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News.
“All manufacturers, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and others are looking at how they can improve their vaccine to make sure that we are ready for any variant – there are about 4,000 variants around the world of COVID now.”

Despite the landmark data, it remains unclear how long it will take to vaccinate the world. Many of those vaccinated have received only one of two doses required.
Britain’s health minister will make an announcement on further plans to order hotel quarantine for some travelers on Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.
Last month Johnson said arrivals from high-risk nations would have to quarantine for 10 days in government-provided accommodation to stop the spread of new variants of the virus, but the measure has not yet been introduced.
Britain launched a trial on Thursday to assess the immune response to doses of the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca combined in a two-shot schedule.
The researchers behind the trial said data on vaccinating people with the two types of vaccines could help them understand if there could be greater flexibility in rolling out shots worldwide. Initial data on immune responses is expected to be generated around June.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/merck-anti-baldness-drug-propecia-long-trail-suicide-reports/,"Merck anti-baldness drug Propecia has long trail of suicide reports, records show","Newly unsealed court documents and other records show that Merck & Co and US regulators knew about reports of suicidal behavior in men taking the company’s anti-baldness treatment Propecia when they decided not to warn consumers of those potential risks in a 2011 update of the popular drug’s label.
Internal records from Merck were made public in late January, when a federal magistrate in Brooklyn, New York, granted a 2019 Reuters motion to unseal 11 documents filed in years of litigation alleging Propecia caused persistent sexual dysfunction and other harmful side effects.
Since the 2011 decision on the warning, the FDA has received more than 700 reports of suicide and suicidal thoughts among people taking Propecia or generic versions of the drug. Those included at least 100 deaths. Before that, in the first 14 years the drug was on the market, the agency received 34 such reports, including 10 deaths.
Annual US prescriptions of finasteride, as the drug is known, for hair loss increased to over 2.4 million in 2020, more than double the number in 2015, according to health data company IQVIA.
European and Canadian regulators, citing similar reports among men taking finasteride, require a warning of suicidal thoughts on the label, though they note that research has not proved that the drug causes such thoughts. To this day, the US label contains no mention of suicide or suicidal thoughts.
As early as 2009, Merck knew of more than 200 reports of depression, including suicidal thoughts, in men taking Propecia, according to an internal “risk management” assessment from that year. The company decided there were too few reports of serious depression and suicidal behavior and not enough specifics about those cases to warrant more than “routine” monitoring of safety data.
In 2011, two years after the Merck risk analysis, the FDA was weighing a company request to add “depression” to the drug’s label as a potential risk, with no warnings related to suicide. FDA analysts disagreed about adding a warning related to suicide, according to previously unreported government documents. But the regulator ultimately agreed with Merck’s request on the grounds that the number of suicides was lower than one would expect in this group of patients.
Some medical researchers and patient advocates said Merck and the FDA have left American consumers in the dark about potentially life-threatening dangers associated with finasteride.
“No family should ever have to learn about this after the fact,” said Kim Witczak, a consumer advocate who serves on an FDA advisory panel for psychiatric drugs. She has called for drug companies and regulators to issue stronger warnings after her husband died from suicide in 2003 5 weeks after being prescribed an antidepressant for insomnia. Merck “had an opportunity to put suicide on the label, but they didn’t want to do that because it’s all about sales.”
Michael Irwig, an endocrinologist and Harvard Medical School faculty member whose own research has found possible links between finasteride and suicidal behaviors, said Merck’s handling of the risk analysis and the FDA’s inaction keep critical information from the public. Merck “definitely should have provided a more complete picture,” Irwig said.
In a statement to Reuters, Merck said that “the scientific evidence does not support a causal link between Propecia and suicide or suicidal ideation and these terms should not be included in the labeling” for the drug. “Merck works continuously with regulators to ensure that potential safety signals are carefully analyzed and, if appropriate, included in the label for Propecia.”
Merck has said in past statements that Propecia has been prescribed safely to millions of men since the late 1990s. It also has argued in court that “premature hair loss itself, the very condition for which Propecia is prescribed, is associated with low self-esteem, poor body image, and depression.”
In a statement, FDA said it “continues to monitor postmarketing safety data for Propecia.” Overall, the agency noted that the presence of a report in the FDA database “does not mean the drug caused the adverse event” and medical problems may stem from the “underlying disease being treated, caused by some other drug being taken concurrently, or occurred for other reasons.”
FDA declined to comment further about its handling of Propecia and reports related to suicide.
Merck’s analysis of a potential suicide risk stayed secret in court for over 3 years – and only became public after Reuters intervened in the proceeding. The insights in the recently unsealed documents echo findings from Reuters’ 2019 investigation, “Hidden Injustice,” which revealed how US judges routinely allow makers of consumer products to file under seal in lawsuits information that is pertinent to public health and safety. They often do so without explanation, though in most jurisdictions, they are required to provide one.
The Reuters investigation found that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed or seriously injured in recent decades by allegedly defective products – including drugs, cars, and medical devices – while evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger remained hidden.
In granting Reuters’ motion to unseal Merck documents, US Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo last month ruled that the company’s arguments for continued secrecy “are so weak that they would not overcome even a low presumption of access under the common law.”
In addition to the risk management plan, Kuo unsealed other Merck documents including an internal marketing report from prior to the drug’s launch and some communications with regulators regarding sexual dysfunction. Reuters obtained the FDA documents discussing suicide from a separate online repository maintained by the agency.
In 2010, while reviewing Merck’s proposal to add potential depression risk to Propecia’s label, an FDA safety evaluator recommended also adding a warning for suicidal thoughts and behavior, noting 9 suicides and reports of other suicidal behaviors among patients who took finasteride, the FDA documents reviewed by Reuters show.
The reports of suicidal behavior analyzed by Merck and government regulators, known as “adverse event” reports, are filed by consumers, doctors and other members of the public. They are compiled in a public database by US regulators, as well as drug-safety agencies in other countries.
In her November 2010 report, FDA safety evaluator Namita Kothary wrote that the 9 suicides were difficult to assess due to incomplete information. “However, we cannot exclude that finasteride may have contributed to the events,” she wrote. Kothary did not respond to requests for comment.
Two other FDA reviewers disagreed. The two physicians – Amy Woitach and David Kettl – said the data supported adding depression to the label. Suicidal ideation, however, should be left off because the number of suicidal thoughts, attempts, and deaths was “lower than would be expected in this patient population,” according to their December 2010 report. Kettl and Woitach did not respond to requests for comment.
The European Medicines Agency found the relationship between finasteride and depression was hard to assess, but still required a warning about suicidal ideation in 2017, in part because Propecia is not prescribed for a serious condition, according to EMA committee meeting minutes. Doctors and patients generally weigh risks differently for a drug to treat a life-threatening health problem, versus something less severe.
When Health Canada required its warning in 2019, it noted 368 international reports of suicidal events reported in patients treated with finasteride through September 2018. Merck did not respond to questions about these regulatory moves.
The FDA approved Propecia in 1997, and sales climbed steadily through the 2000s, peaking at $447 million in 2010. Soon after, Merck’s patent expired. Overall sales of finasteride have remained strong as cheaper generic versions have hit the market.
The new information regarding a potential suicide risk emerged as a result of longstanding controversy about sexual problems associated with the drugs.
From the beginning, Merck’s label said Propecia caused sexual dysfunction in nearly 4% of its clinical study participants. However, the 2009 risk management report also shows that the company was aware of reports that those sexual problems continued for some men after they stopped taking the drug.
The FDA in 2012 approved Merck’s request to add a warning of erectile dysfunction that continued after stopping the drug, as well as “libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders.” Even so, Merck at the time said scientific evidence did not establish that Propecia caused persistent sexual dysfunction.
The warning prompted more than 1,100 lawsuits against Merck by men alleging their sexual problems lasted long after they stopped taking Propecia. Merck in 2018 agreed to settle most of the lawsuits consolidated before Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn federal court for a combined $4.3 million.
Reuters reported in 2019 that prior to the settlement, plaintiffs’ lawyers had alleged that Merck, when revising the drug’s original label, understated the number of men who experienced sexual symptoms in clinical trials and how long those symptoms lasted. The allegation was part of a sealed court brief a Reuters reporter was able to read because of a redaction error. The brief cited internal Merck communications, filed under seal. Reuters intervened in the case, seeking to unseal those communications.
The 2009 risk management report unsealed last month shows that while depression did not emerge as a risk in clinical trials, Merck deemed it an “important potential risk” after the company received 218 global reports of depression from 1998 to 2008. Of those, 10 involved serious depression, and an additional 9 involved suicidal behavior.
Merck noted limitations with both the depression reports and the nine involving suicidal behavior. Four provided “insufficient information to allow a full evaluation.” Three of the men had other medical conditions, and for two, the symptoms developed after they stopped taking the drug.
“One fatal report was received from a sheriff’s office and described a male who committed suicide by shooting,” according to the report. “The medical examiner did not think this event was related to Propecia, in addition, the report provided insufficient information to allow for assessment.”
The report contained no additional details about the patient’s identity or the medical examiner’s investigation. Merck did not respond to questions about what steps it took to learn more about the case.
In its statement to Reuters, Merck said adverse event reports reflect only the opinions of the person who files them. “While consumers and healthcare professionals are encouraged to report adverse events, the reaction may have been related to the underlying disease being treated, or caused by some other drug being taken concurrently, or occurred for other reasons,” the company said.
Dr W. Vaughn McCall, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Health Behavior at the Medical College of Georgia, agreed that relying on adverse event reports to monitor drug safety has its limitations. However, he said one of those limitations is that injuries and deaths are often underreported because people aren’t familiar with the process or don’t have time to examine a specific case.
He said there is a plausible biological explanation for a potential link between Propecia and suicidal thoughts. The drug reduces a testosterone-related hormone, which in turn could impact an anti-depressive steroid produced in the body.
“There is a reason to be suspicious,” McCall said.",Reuters,"Feb 4, 2021 11:47 AM PHT"

But attitudes and confidence vary widely in the 15 countries covered in the survey, with France showing high levels of skepticism and some Asian countries showing declining trust in vaccines, while some European nations see rising confidence.
Overall, vaccine confidence is higher than in November, when the same survey – conducted in 15 countries and covering 13,500 people each time – found that only 40% would be willing to get vaccinated.
The survey, co-led by YouGov and Imperial College London’s Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI), found that people in Britain were the most willing to have a COVID-19 vaccine, at 78%, followed by Denmark at 67%.
France had the highest proportion of respondents who said they would not take a vaccine, at 44%, but saw a doubling in the proportion who strongly agreed that they would take a vaccine, from 15% in November to 30% in January.
In Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, willingness to take a vaccine has dropped off since November, with Japan showing the least preparedness, followed by Singapore.
“As vaccines will play a vital role in controlling the pandemic, leaders must act now to help more people understand the benefits of being vaccinated against COVID-19 and make sure that no one is left behind,” said David Nabarro, the IGHI’s co-director and a World Health Organization expert on COVID-19.
The survey is part of efforts by the WHO and other bodies to monitor health-related behavior and attitudes during the pandemic.
Since April 2020 researchers have surveyed more 470,000 people worldwide. This most recent survey ran from January 4-24.

The dogs are conditioned to scent out the “corona odor” that comes from cells in infected people, said Esther Schalke, a vet at Germany’s armed forces school for service dogs.
Filou, a 3-year-old Belgian Shepherd, and Joe Cocker, a 1-year-old Cocker Spaniel, are two of the dogs being trained at Hanover’s University of Veterinary Medicine.
“We did a study where we had dogs sniffing samples from COVID-positive patients and we can say that they have a 94% probability in our study…that they can sniff them out,” said Holger Volk, head of the veterinary clinic.
“So dogs can really sniff out people with infections and without infections, as well as asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID patients,” he added.
Stephan Weil, premier of Lower Saxony, the state of which Hanover is the capital, said he was impressed with the study and called for a feasibility tests before the sniffer dogs are put to use in everyday life, such as on people attending concerts.
“We now need tests in selected events,” Weil said.
In Finland, dogs trained to detect the novel coronavirus began sniffing passenger samples at Finland’s Helsinki-Vantaa airport last September, in a pilot project alongside more usual testing at the airport.

DiMeo is still getting used to his hands and face. He has had them for less than 6 months, the product of breakthrough surgery after a fiery accident left stumps where is fingers used to be and his old face severely disfigured.
“You know, it’s really surprising to me when something new touches it or I touch something new and I can feel it for the first time,” he said in an interview.
As he pushes himself through hours a day of rehab, DiMeo said he is driven by the goal of moving out of his parents’ home in Clark Township, New Jersey, and even getting behind the wheel of a car again.
“Driving is the biggest goal I have so far,” he said.
It was driving that started his nightmare.
Coming home from his night-shift job as a product tester on July 14, 2018, DiMeo’s car crashed, rolled over, and exploded, leaving him with third-degree burns over 80% of his body.
He spent 4 months in the burn unit at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey, part of the time in an induced coma, and endured some 20 reconstructive surgeries that still left him with only limited use of his hands and face.
Lucky to be alive, DiMeo was referred in March 2019 to Dr Eduardo Rodriguez, who heads the plastic surgery department at NYU Langone Health and had already performed 3 successful face transplants.
On August 12, Rodriguez led a team of more than 140 surgeons, nurses, and other staff in a 23-hour procedure that gave DiMeo a new face and pair of hands in the first such double transplant ever performed.
“We wanted to give him not only an operation that made him look better, but it ultimately had to work ideally, especially with the hands,” Rodriguez said.
DiMeo’s recovery is still a work in progress with up to 5 hours of rehab a day, but Rodriguez said his patient is doing amazingly well.
“It’s a testament to him as an individual, his commitment to his therapy, and his willingness to not give up,” Rodriguez said.
DiMeo marks his progress by reflecting on the things he is now able to do now, like fixing his own breakfast and doing his workouts by himself. But he is not slowing down.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/indonesia-decision-prioritize-covid-19-vaccination-citizens-18-59-years-old-questionable/,Indonesia’s decision to prioritize COVID-19 vaccination to citizens aged 18-59 years old questionable,"The Indonesian government policy to exclude the elderly (aged 60 years and above) in the first phase of the free COVID-19 vaccination program could hinder the vaccine’s impact in lowering mortality rates.
As of January 13, 2021, the government prioritizes early-stage vaccination for health workers, civil servants, and citizens aged 18-59 years old. The CoronaVac vaccines from Chinese company Sinovac will not be used to vaccinate elderly citizens aged 60 years old and above.
Considering the enormous COVID-19 mortality rates in Indonesia, the highest in Southeast Asia, which are dominated by those in the 60 years and above age bracket (45% of the total confirmed deaths from COVID-19), this policy is problematic.
In addition, this policy is inconsistent with the technical guide regarding vaccine recipient prioritisation issued by the government on January 4, 2021. This guide also incorporates the technical recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) to prioritize health workers in the first phase of vaccination, and then civil servants and those aged 60 and above in the second phase (estimated to be January-April 2021).
The government argues that vaccinating citizens of productive age, who are more mobile than the elderly, will protect the latter who live in multigenerational households and stay at home. This, according to the government, will provide indirect protection across age groups.
The government also claimed that there is yet available data on CoronaVac vaccine safety for senior citizens. Furthermore, the National Agency of Drug and Food Control (BPOM) so far has only authorised CoronaVac vaccines for citizens aged 18-59 years old.
We elaborate on why these claims are questionable.
In September 2020, Sinovac released the preliminary results of their phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in China for healthy people aged 60 years and above. Currently, the same vaccine is being tested in a phase 3 clinical trial in Bandung, Indonesia.
The preliminary results indicated that the CoronaVac vaccine showed good immunogenicity (ability to trigger immunity) against the virus that causes COVID-19. The vaccine was deemed safe to use for healthy people aged 60 years and above. There were no serious adverse effects related to the vaccine in the clinical trial volunteers.
Turkey, one of the Sinovac phase 3 clinical trial sites, granted emergency use authorization for CoronaVac, targeting health workers and those above 65 years years of age in its early phase of vaccine roll-out. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, 66 years old, was the first recipient of the CoronaVac vaccine.
Empirical evidence regarding CoronaVac vaccine safety and efficacy from a trial involving elderly in Brazil has also been circulating. Unfortunately, the data (from China and Brazil) were not considered in the evaluation by the National Agency of Drug and Food Control (BPOM) of Indonesia.
Based on clinical trials results of various COVID-19 vaccines that have been released, current vaccines are proven to reduce the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 with varying levels of efficacy.
But, these trials have not answered precisely how efficacious these vaccines are in reducing the risk of transmission or infection.
The phase 3 CoronaVac clinical trial protocol in Brazil, for example, stated that the primary endpoints are: (1) the efficacy in reducing the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 cases; and (2) the safety of the vaccine in adults (aged 18-59 years old) and the elderly (aged 60 years old and above).
Recently, preliminary results from the phase 3 clinical trial in Brazil showed 50.39% efficacy in lowering the incidence rate of symptomatic COVID-19 (with 95% confidence interval: 35.26-61.98%). There is no reliable evidence from the trial on the efficacy against the transmission of the virus.
Data on CoronaVac vaccine safety and efficacy for those aged 60 years and above are available to be further evaluated by BPOM.
Kusnandi Rusmil, the principal investigator of the CoronaVac Vaccine Clinical Trial Research Team in Indonesia, stated that data regarding vaccine safety on the elderly can be obtained from clinical trials in other countries.
BPOM has the right and obligation to request those data for further assessment so that recommendations for CoronaVac vaccine use in Indonesia can potentially be extended to elderly population immediately.
BPOM should immediately consider preliminary clinical trial results from every location testing the CoronaVac vaccine in a more comprehensive and detailed manner. These data can provide some evidence regarding vaccine efficacy and safety in the elderly. The differences between sample size and characteristics in every clinical trial location might affect efficacy and safety results and should be evaluated proportionally, based on the overall clinical trial data across locations.
Amid the high mortality rate in the elderly group due to COVID-19, overwhelmed health care facilities in various cities, and limited vaccines availability, the government should prioritize elderly in the first phase of the vaccination roll-out.
By prioritizing vaccination for the elderly, Indonesia may optimally reduce the hospital burden and COVID-19 deaths amid a limited vaccine supply during the first vaccination phase. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/recovered-covid-19-patients-likely-protected-at-least-6-months/,"Recovered COVID-19 patients likely protected for at least 6 months, study finds","Almost all people previously infected with COVID-19 have high levels of antibodies for at least 6 months that are likely to protect them from reinfection with the disease, results of a major UK study showed on Wednesday, February 3.
Scientists said the study, which measured levels of previous COVID-19 infection in populations across Britain, as well as how long antibodies persisted in those infected, should provide some reassurance that swift cases of reinfection will be rare.
“The vast majority of people retain detectable antibodies for at least 6 months after infection with the coronavirus,” said Naomi Allen, a professor and chief scientist at the UK Biobank, where the study was carried out.
Among participants who had tested positive for previous COVID-19 infection, 99% retained antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 for 3 months, the results showed. After the full 6 months of follow-up in the study, 88% still had them.
“Although we cannot be certain how this relates to immunity, the results suggest that people may be protected against subsequent infection for at least 6 months following natural infection,” Allen said.
She said the findings were also consistent with results of other studies in the United Kingdom and Iceland which found that antibodies to the coronavirus tended to persist for several months in those who have had the disease and recovered.
A study of UK healthcare workers published last month found that people who have had COVID-19 were likely to be protected for at least 5 months, but noted that those with antibodies may still be able to carry and spread the virus.
The UK Biobank study also found that the proportion of the UK population with COVID-19 antibodies – a measure known as seroprevalence – rose from 6.6% at the start of the study period in May/June 2020 to 8.8% by November/December 2020.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/do-men-really-take-longer-to-poo/,Do men really take longer to poo?,"There’s a common assumption men take longer than women to poo. People say so on Twitter, in memes, and elsewhere online. But is that right? What could explain it? And if some people are really taking longer, is that a problem?
As we sift through the evidence, it’s important to remember pooing may involve time spent sitting on the toilet and the defecation process itself.
And there may be differences between men and women in these separate aspects of going to the toilet. But the evidence for these differences isn’t always as strong as we’d like.
Read more: Do we have to poo every day? We asked five experts
Men do appear to spend more time sitting on the toilet. An online survey by a bathroom retailer suggested men spend up to 14 minutes a day compared with women, who spend almost eight minutes a day. But this survey doesn’t have the rigour of a well-designed scientific study.
Would there be any physiological reason to explain why men spend longer on the toilet? Well, the evidence actually suggests the opposite.
We know it takes longer for food to travel through the intestines in women than in men. Women are also more likely to suffer from constipation related to irritable bowel syndrome than men. So, you’d expect women to take longer to defecate, from the start of the bowel motion to expulsion.
But this is not the case even if you take into account differences in fiber intake between men and women.
Read more: Explainer: what is irritable bowel syndrome and what can I do about it?
Instead, how long it takes someone to poo (the defaecation time) is heavily influenced by the mucus lining the large bowel. This mucus makes the bowel slippery and easier for the stools to be expelled. But there’s no evidence this mucus lining is different in men and women.
One thing we do know, however, is mammals from elephants to mice have a similar defecation time, around 12 seconds.
For humans, it’s slightly longer, but still quick. In one study it took healthy adults an average two minutes when sitting, but only 51 seconds when squatting. Again, there were no differences in defaecation time between men and women, whether sitting or squatting.
If there’s no strong evidence one way or the other to explain any gender differences in how long it takes to poo, what’s going on? For that, we need to look at the total time spent on the toilet.
Read more: What’s the best way to go to the toilet – squatting or sitting?
What I call the “toilet sitting time” is the time of defecation itself and the time allocated to other activities sitting on the toilet. For most people, the time spent just sitting, aside from defecating, accounts for most of their time there.
So what are people doing? Mainly reading. And it seems men are more likely to read on the toilet than women.
For instance, a study of almost 500 adults in Israel found almost two-thirds (64%) of men regularly read on the toilet compared with 41% of women. The longer people spent on the toilet, the more likely they were to be reading. However, in the decade or more since this study was conducted, you’d expect adults would be more likely to be reading or playing games on their mobile phones rather than reading paper books.
People might also be sitting longer on the toilet for some temporary relief from the stresses of life.
One poll found 56% of people find sitting on the toilet relaxing, and 39% a good opportunity to have “some time alone.” Another online survey revealed one in six people reported going to the toilet for “peace and quiet”. Although these are not scientific studies, they offer useful insights into a social phenomenon.
Then there can be medical reasons for a prolonged defecation time, and consequently a lengthier time sitting on the toilet.
An anal fissure (a tear or crack in the lining of the anus) can make defecation a painful and lengthy process. These fissures are just as common in men as in women.
And obstructive defecation, where people cannot empty the rectum properly, is a common cause of chronic constipation. This is more common in middle-aged women.
In a Turkish study, spending more than 5 minutes on the toilet was associated with hemorrhoids and anal fissures. Another study from Italy noted the longer the time people spent on the toilet, the more severe their hemorrhoids.
One theory behind this is prolonged sitting increases pressure inside the abdomen. This leads to less blood flow into the veins of the rectum when passing a bowel motion, and ultimately to blood pooling in the vascular cushions of the anus. This makes hemorrhoids more likely to develop.
Read more: Explainer: why do people get haemorrhoids and how do you get rid of them?
In addition to the usual advice about increasing the amount of fiber in your diet and ensuring you drink enough water, it would be sensible to limit the amount of time spent on the toilet.
Different researchers recommend a different upper limit. But I and others recommend the SEN approach:

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-january-2021/,J&J vaccine adds to COVID-19 armory with 66% global trial efficacy,"Johnson & Johnson said on Friday, January 29, that its single-dose vaccine was 66% effective in preventing COVID-19 in a large global trial against multiple variants, giving health officials another weapon to tackle the pandemic.
In the trial of nearly 44,000 volunteers, the level of protection against moderate and severe COVID-19 varied from 72% in the United States, to 66% in Latin America and just 57% in South Africa, from where a worrying variant has spread.
A high bar has been set by two authorized vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which were around 95% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in pivotal trials when given in two doses.
Those trials, however, were conducted mainly in the United States and before new variants emerged.
Top US infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci said the variations in effectiveness around the world underlined the need to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible to prevent new variants from emerging.
“It’s really a wake up call for us to be nimble and to be able to adjust as this virus will continue for certain to evolve,” Fauci said.
J&J’s main goal was the prevention of moderate to severe COVID-19, and the vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization across all geographies and against multiple variants 28 days after immunization.
That “will potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of COVID-19,” Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, said of the results, which were based on 468 symptomatic cases.
Shares in J&J were trading down 4% at $162.44 at 1500 GMT and some Wall Street analysts said that its figures on effectiveness against COVID-19 were below those of competitors. Rival Moderna gained 12% to $180.
J&J plans to seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration next week and will soon follow up with filings with the European Union and the rest of the world.
It has said it plans to deliver 1 billion doses of the vaccine, which it will make in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India, in 2021.
Public health officials are counting on it to increase much-needed supply and simplify immunization in the United States, which has a deal to buy 100 million doses of J&J’s vaccine and an option for an additional 200 million.
J&J said the vaccine would be ready immediately upon emergency approval, but Stoffels declined to say how many doses.
“The key is not only overall efficacy but specifically efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization, and death,” said Walid Gellad, a health policy associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh.
None of the vaccine recipients in the J&J trial died from COVID-19, compared with 5 in the placebo group, the National Institutes of Health said. While there were 3 deaths in the vaccine group overall, none were determined to be from the virus, compared with 16 deaths overall in the placebo arm.
J&J’s vaccine uses a common cold virus to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells and trigger an immune response, whereas the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines employ a new technology called messenger RNA.
Unlike these vaccines, J&J’s does not require a second shot weeks after the first or need to be kept frozen, making it a strong candidate for use in parts of the world where transportation and cold storage present problems.
“Most countries are still desperate to get their hands on doses, regardless of whether or not the vaccine is considered highly effective. Moderately effective will do just fine for now,” Michael Breen, Director of Infectious Diseases and Ophthalmology at research firm GlobalData, said.
Several studies have emerged this month showing that a South African variant has mutated in areas of the virus that are key targets of vaccines, reducing their efficacy.
“What we are learning is there is different efficacy in different parts of the world,” Stoffels told Reuters.
In a sub-study of 6,000 volunteers in South Africa, Stoffels said, the J&J vaccine was 89% effective at preventing severe disease. In the South Africa portion of the trial, 95% of cases were infections with the South African variant.
“I am overwhelmed by the fact that this vaccine protected against severe disease even in South Africa,” said Glenda Gray, the joint lead investigator of the South African vaccine trial.
Gray, who is the chief executive of the South African Medical Research Council, said this is by far the best vaccine for South Africa to fight the mutant strain and can prevent a large number of hospitalizations and deaths.
A mid-stage trial of a Novovax coronavirus vaccine in South Africa also showed lower efficacy, proving 60% effective among volunteers who didn’t have HIV. In a separate, late-stage trial in Britain it was 89.3% effective.
In the J&J trial, which was conducted in 8 countries, 44% of participants were from the United States, 41% from Central and South America and 15% from South Africa. Just over a third of the volunteers were over 60.",Reuters,"Jan 29, 2021 9:30 PM PHT"

A World Health Organization-led team of experts investigating the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic was due to meet Chinese scientists on Friday, January 29, and plans to visit labs, markets and hospitals in the city of Wuhan, the WHO said.
The group is expected to spend two more weeks in China, and will visit the seafood market at the center of the early outbreak. It will also visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
One hypothesis, rejected by China, is that the outbreak was caused by a leak at the government lab.
Vietnam reported 9 more new COVID-19 infections early on Friday as its first outbreak for nearly two months spread to Hanoi, the capital, where the ruling Communist Party is holding its key five-yearly congress.
At an urgent meeting held on Thursday night, Hanoi authorities said they were ramping up tracking and testing capabilities, adding that the city can conduct 10,000 tests a day. State television quoted the coronavirus taskforce chief as saying preparations should be made for up to 30,000 COVID-19 cases.
South Korea has delayed until Sunday, January 31, any easing of social distancing measures because outbreaks involving Christian mission schools are threatening to undermine efforts to keep new infections under control ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays.
South Korea’s social distancing policy has become a whack-a-mole game, a repetition of tightening and easing of curfews and restrictions, said Kim Woo-joo, a professor of infectious diseases at Korea University Guro Hospital in Seoul.
Britain is banning direct passenger flights to and from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from Friday, shutting down the current world’s busiest international airline route from Dubai to London.
Britain said it was adding the UAE, Burundi and Rwanda to its coronavirus travel ban list because of worries over the spread of a more contagious and potentially vaccine-resistant COVID-19 variant first identified in South Africa.
After developing COVID-19 vaccines at record speed, drugmakers are already facing variants of the rapidly evolving coronavirus that may render them ineffective, a challenge that will require months of research and a massive financial investment, according to disease experts.
A global surveillance network to assess emerging variants must be built. Scientists need to establish what level of antibodies will be required to protect people from COVID-19 and determine when vaccines need to be altered. And regulators must convey what is needed to demonstrate updated vaccines are still safe and effective.",Reuters,"Jan 29, 2021 2:36 PM PHT"

The study by Pfizer and scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), which has not yet been peer-reviewed, showed a less than two-fold reduction in antibody titer levels, indicating the vaccine would likely be effective in neutralizing a virus with the so-called E484K and N501Y mutations found in the South African variant.
The study was conducted on blood taken from people who had received the vaccine. Its findings are limited because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in the new South African variant.
While these findings don’t indicate the need for a new vaccine to address the emerging variants, Pfizer and BioNTech are prepared to respond if a variant of SARS-CoV-2 shows evidence of escaping immunity by the COVID-19 vaccine, the companies said.
The scientists are currently engineering a virus with the full set of mutations and expect to have results from that in around two weeks, according to Pei-Yong Shi, an author of the study and a professor at UTMB.
The results are more encouraging than another non-peer-reviewed study from scientists at Columbia University earlier on Wednesday, January 27, which used a slightly different method and showed antibodies generated by the shots were significantly less effective against the South Africa variant.
One possible reason for the difference could be that the Pfizer findings are based on an engineered coronavirus, and the Columbia study used a pseudovirus based on the vesicular stomatitis virus, a different type of virus, UTMB’s Shi said. He said he believes that finding in pseudoviruses should be validated using the real virus.
The study also showed even better results against several key mutations from the highly transmissible UK variant of the virus. Shi said they were also working on an engineered virus with the full set of mutations from that variant as well.",Reuters,"Jan 28, 2021 6:54 PM PHT"

A World Health Organization-led team investigating the origins of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic was expected to leave their quarantine hotel on Thursday, January 28, to begin field work, two weeks after arriving in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged in late 2019.
The mission has been plagued by delay, concerns over access and bickering between China and the United States, which has accused Beijing of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and has criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research.
The number of COVID-19 infections in England is starting to fall, possibly reflecting the impact of a new lockdown, but cases are not coming down quickly enough and prevalence remains very high, a large study showed on Thursday.
For the period Jan. 6 to 22, London and other areas of the South showed declines in prevalence, but there was clear evidence of a growth in cases in the East Midlands. The pattern in other regions was that prevalence was flat.
New Zealand, Vietnam, and Taiwan filled the top three places in a COVID Performance Index that ranked nearly 100 countries by how successfully they handled the coronavirus pandemic, with Britain and America near the bottom of the pile.
Australia’s Lowy Institute think-tank said it evaluated 98 countries in the 36 weeks that followed their hundredth confirmed case of COVID-19, using data available to Jan. 9, 2021. It excluded China, where the first cases were identified in December 2019, due to a lack of publicly available data.
Vietnam’s health minister on Thursday said 81 people had tested positive for the coronavirus linked to two cases announced earlier in the day, which were the country’s first-known locally transmitted infections in nearly two months.
Though a tiny number compared with new coronavirus infections in many countries, the cases are a jolt for Vietnam. Thanks to strict quarantine, testing and tracing measures, it had reported only 1,551 cases and 35 COVID-19 deaths before Thursday, earning it a top three spot in a survey of how well countries have handled the pandemic.
Pfizer Inc and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine appeared to lose only a small bit of effectiveness against an engineered virus with three key mutations from the new coronavirus variant found in South Africa, according to a laboratory study conducted by the U.S. drugmaker.
The scientists are currently engineering a virus with the full set of mutations and expect to have results from that in around two weeks, according to Pei-Yong Shi, an author of the study and a professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB).
Severe COVID-19 infections are beginning to abate in many parts of the United States even as the death toll mounts, signalling an end to the pandemic’s post-holiday surge and prompting some states to ease public health restrictions.

The Lowy Institute said its index published on Thursday, January 28, excludes China, where the first cases were identified in December 2019, due to a lack of publicly available data.
Other countries in the top 10 include Thailand, Cyprus, Rwanda, Iceland, Australia, Latvia and Sri Lanka – countries with fewer reported cases and deaths both in aggregate and per capita terms.
In total, 98 countries were evaluated in the 36 weeks that followed their hundredth confirmed case of COVID-19, using data available to January 9, 2021.
Fourteen-day rolling averages of new daily figures were calculated for confirmed cases, confirmed cases per million people, confirmed deaths, confirmed deaths per million people, confirmed cases as a proportion of tests, and tests per thousand people, the Lowy Institute said.
The report comes as world coronavirus cases surpass 100 million with the death toll exceeding 2 million.
The United States, with over 25 million confirmed cases, ranked 94, while India, with more than 11 million cases, was 86th. Britain, with the highest number of the deaths in Europe, stood at 66th.
The index showed countries in Asia-Pacific proved the most successful in containing the pandemic, while Europe and the United States were “quickly overwhelmed” by the rapid spread of COVID-19.
“Levels of economic development or differences in political systems between countries had less of an impact on outcomes than often assumed or publicised,” the Sydney-based Lowy Institute said in its analysis.
“In general, countries with smaller populations, cohesive societies, and capable institutions have a comparative advantage in dealing with a global crisis such as a pandemic.”

The variant, identified in southeast England in December, is thought to be more transmissible, and could also be associated with higher mortality, though data suggesting increased death rates are uncertain and not yet strong.
Britain’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that other differences had been observed between those with the variant from the United Kingdom and others with COVID-19.
“Loss of taste and loss of smell were significantly less common in new variant compatible positives than triple positives,” the ONS said in an analysis of the characteristics of people in England with COVID-19, covering the period between November 15, 2020 to January 16, 2021.
A “triple positive” PCR test result indicates that someone has COVID-19 but not the British variant.
“Other symptoms were more common in new variant compatible positives, with the largest differences for cough, sore throat, fatigue, myalgia (muscle pain) and fever,” the ONS said.

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/bill-gates-sees-8-month-lag-poor-countries-get-covid-19-shots/,Bill Gates sees lag of 6 to 8 months for poor countries to get COVID-19 shots,"Poorer countries face a best-case scenario of a 6- to 8-month lag behind richer nations in getting access to COVID-19 vaccines to protect their populations against the pandemic disease, the philanthropist Bill Gates said on Wednesday, January 27.
In an interview with Reuters, Gates called the rollout of the first COVID-19 shots a “super hard allocation problem” that was putting pressure on global institutions, governments and drugmakers.
“Every politician is under pressure to go bid for their country to get further up in line,” Gates said.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has so far committed some $1.75 billion to the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including via funds for the COVAX vaccine-sharing initiative co-led by the World Health Organization, and via direct support for some vaccine makers.
COVAX, co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance, says it aims to deliver 2.3. billion COVID-19 doses by year-end, including 1.8 billion doses to poorer countries at no cost to their governments. It hopes to start some deliveries next month.
Gates said supplies of vaccines via COVAX would be “modest” at first.
“The total number of doses that GAVI (and COVAX) will have in the first half of the year is still very modest. Yes, they will get some doses out, but if you compare when they will reach the same percentage of coverage as the rich countries – that’s where I’d say it’s 6 to 8 months, best case,” he said.
Seth Berkley, CEO of GAVI and a co-lead of COVAX, warned on Tuesday of “a sense of vaccine panic” with many countries pursuing biliateral deals with drugmakers to secure limited supplies and some threatening legal action against drugmakers who have said supplies could be delayed.
Gates said such pressure was unhelpful, noting that pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, BionTech , AstraZeneca, and Moderna all developed COVID-19 vaccines in less than a year.
“If you’re a pharma company that didn’t make a vaccine, you’re not under pressure. But the ones who did make the vaccine– they are the ones being attacked,” he said. “It’s all very zero-sum.”
“It’s the classic situation in global health, where the advocates all of a sudden want it for zero dollars and right away. And I feel like these pharma companies that jumped in, well… they’re the reason we can see the end of the epidemic coming.”
Gates, who also on Wednesday published his foundation’s annual letter outlining its priorities and predictions, said he believed people living in wealthier countries would see the pandemic end, with a return to more normal life, by the end of this year – assuming vaccines could be rolled out to around 70% to 80% of their populations.
He also pointed to some “silver linings” from the pandemic, including vastly accelerated development of the mRNA vaccine technology used in the Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna COVID shots.
In the next five to 10 years, Gates said, mRNA vaccines will become faster and cheaper to develop, easier to scale, and more stable to store, opening the possibility of developing future vaccines against diseases such as HIV and malaria

Global coronavirus cases surpassed 100 million on Wednesday, January 27, according to a Reuters tally, as countries around the world struggle with new virus variants and vaccine shortfalls.
Almost 1.3% of the world’s population has now been infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and more than 2.1 million people have died. One person has been infected every 7.7 seconds, on average, since the start of the year.
COVID-19 vaccination programs in China and India will stretch until late 2022 due to the sheer size of their population, and more than 85 poor countries will not have widespread access to vaccines before 2023, a study showed on Wednesday.
The report said vaccine deliveries to poor countries by global vaccine sharing scheme COVAX, backed by the World Health Organization, may be slow due to delays in delivery to wealthy nations first and poor infrastructure in the developing world.
The United States aims to acquire an additional 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech, and Moderna Incorporated each, President Joe Biden said on Tuesday, enough to inoculate most Americans by summertime, as he races to curb a pandemic he warned could still get worse.
Meanwhile, Europe urged pharmaceutical companies on Tuesday to honor their commitments to supply coronavirus vaccines, as delivery cuts and delays dim hopes of a quick fix to COVID-19 and increase talk of protectionism and hoarding.
Japan’s vaccination roll-out faces logistical hurdles that could further delay the slow-moving campaign, experts and officials say, complicating plans to deliver wide-scale coronavirus inoculations in time for the Olympics.
Already the last major industrial country to start mass vaccinations, Japan is likely to be hampered on the ground by a lack of containers and dry ice, and difficulties in recruiting medical staff, more than a dozen people involved in the inoculation drive told Reuters.
South Korean authorities were scrambling on Wednesday to contain coronavirus outbreaks centred around Christian schools as it reported a jump in infections, dampening hopes of a speedy exit from a third wave of the pandemic.
The Christian organisation responsible for the facilities, International Mission, was ordered to test everyone linked to 32 of its 40 schools and churches around the country. It said that while some infected students may have been asymptomatic it had also failed to require students with cold-like symptoms to get tested.
With shops boarded up and riot police out in force, it was relatively calm in Dutch cities on Tuesday night after three days of violence during which around 500 people were detained.
In several cities, including the capital Amsterdam, some businesses closed early and emergency ordinances were in place to give law enforcement greater powers to respond to the rioting, which was prompted by a nighttime curfew to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

The WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, known as SAGE, said that the vaccine should be given in two doses at an interval of 28 days, which could be extended under exceptional circumstances to 42 days.
The guidance on Moderna came several weeks after issuing their recommendations on the rival Pfizer vaccine.
“The main recommendation for the use of this (Moderna) vaccine is that based on the current elements we recommend it should be given in doses of 100 micrograms or 0.5 ml with an interval of 28 days,” Alejandro Cravioto, panel chair, told a news briefing.
“This interval might be moved to 42 days but the evidence we have does not go beyond that time,” he said.
After reviewing data the independent experts said it did not recommend the Moderna vaccine be used on pregnant women unless they are health workers exposed to the virus or have medical conditions putting them at high risk.
WHO director of immunization Kate O’Brien said that clinical trials of the Moderna vaccine were needed on pregnant women.
“There is no reason to think there could be a problem in pregnancy, we are just acknowledging the data is not there at the moment,” she said.
The WHO was liaising with Moderna on data it submitted as part of its application for WHO emergency use listing and would make a decision soon, she said, adding: “We are doing everything with Moderna to accelerate that process.”
The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, both using mRNA technology, are “very similar,” except for Pfizer requiring an ultra cold chain which is difficult for some countries, O’Brien said.

“The other things in the guidance that are new are that COVID-19 patients at home should have the use of pulse oximetry, that’s measuring the oxygen levels, so you can identify whether somewhat at home is deteriorating and would be better off having hospital care,” WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told a UN briefing in Geneva.
The WHO advised clinicians to put patients into the awake prone position, on their front, shown to improve the oxygen flow, she said.
“Also we recommend, we suggest the use, of low-dose anti-coagulents to prevent blood clots forming in blood vessels. We suggest the use of lower doses rather than higher doses because higher doses may lead to other problems,” Harris said.
She added that a WHO-led team of independent experts, currently in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the first human cases were detected in December 2019, is due to leave quarantine in the next two days to pursue its work with Chinese researchers on the virus origins.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/what-behind-fears-uk-coronavirus-variant-more-lethal/,What is behind fears that UK coronavirus variant is more lethal?,"British scientists have said the UK variant of the coronavirus that is behind a surge in COVID-19 infections there may be not only more transmissible, but also more lethal – with a mortality risk around 30% higher than other variants.
The UK variant – known as B117 – is also up to 70% more contagious than other coronavirus variants circulating in the UK and has already been detected across the world. US health officials have warned it could become the dominant variant there by March.
The mortality-risk evidence comes from the UK government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) and is based on 4 separate studies carried out on the same dataset. The studies link data from COVID-19 testing in the community with deaths from the disease.
While each analysis showed a slightly different result, all of them pointed to higher mortality risk among people infected with the B117 variant than among those infected with other variants in the UK.
None of the analyses suggested the death risk is lower.
NERVTAG combined the findings into a model which estimated an average mortality risk increase of about 30%.
The UK government’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Valance, said on Friday that there was some “uncertainty” about the mortality rate estimates because the data were from a series of different bits of information.
The preliminary data come from analyses of a relatively small proportion of the UK population who were known to be infected with the new variant, said Susan Hopkins, an expert at Public Health England (PHE), adding that evidence “from some but not all data sources” point to a higher death risk. “It is possible that we are not seeing the full picture,” she said.
Julian Tang, a clinical virologist at Leicester University, also noted that numbers were small, so the results “might be potentially subject to large changes later.”
But asked about the uncertainty at a briefing on Monday, John Edmunds, a professor of mathematical modeling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the findings were “statistically significant” and should be taken seriously.
“There is quite a lot of evidence and the effect is not small,” he said.
“It’s not as if this result has just…come up overnight,” he added. “We have been working for weeks on it.”
Scientists are not sure about that yet either, but they are trying to find out.
“Evidence on this variant is still emerging and more work is under way to fully understand how it behaves,” said PHE’s Hopkins.
What scientists do know, however, is that the new variant has a mutation on a part of the virus that makes it more able to bind strongly to human cells.
“That is the most plausible biological explanation for (both) the observed increase in transmissibility and, possibly, the increase in severity that we might be seeing,” said Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at Oxford University and chair of NERVTAG.
Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at Reading University, said this stronger binding could in turn provoke “a stronger overreaction by the immune system, which causes the worst disease, and can be fatal.”
Edmunds, who co-led one of the analyses feeding into the 30% increased mortality risk estimate, described the evidence as “a really serious turn for the worse.”
“This virus is very serious and needs to be taken very seriously,” he said.
PHE stressed in a statement that the absolute risk of death per COVID-19 infection (across all age-groups) “remains low, for both the new variant and the older variant.”",Reuters,"Jan 26, 2021 9:14 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/moderna-believes-vaccine-will-work-against-new-variants/,Moderna says it believes vaccine will work against new variants,"Moderna Inc said on Monday, January 25, it believes its COVID-19 vaccine protects against new variants found in Britain and South Africa, although it will test a new booster shot aimed at the South African variant after concluding the antibody response could be diminished.
The company said in a news release it found no reduction in the antibody response against the variant found in Britain. Against the South African variant, it found a reduced response but still believed its two-dose regimen would provide protection.
Moderna shares closed 12.2% higher at $147.00 on Monday.
The emergence of new variants in Britain, South Africa, and Brazil has created some concern that mutations in the virus may make vaccines less effective.
Moderna said it is looking at whether a booster shot – either of its existing vaccine or of a new shot designed to protect against the South African variant – could be made available in future if evidence were to emerge that protection declined.
“The virus isn’t going to stand still,” Moderna President Stephen Hoge said on a conference call. “While the current strains appear to be well-protected by our COVID-19…it’s important that we remain vigilant and develop potential tools and countermeasures that would allow us to continue to beat back the pandemic.”
Moderna said it expects its current vaccine will remain protective for at least a year after completing the two-dose course. It does not expect to test a third dose until at least 6 months after that course is finished.
Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in a research note it was encouraging that the antibody response of the Moderna vaccine to the South African variant was still above the levels that provide protection.
Yee also said the speed with which Moderna was able to design a new booster shot candidate was proof of the flexibility of the new mRNA technology upon which it is based.
Dr Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the US Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory panel, said he was only mildly concerned the vaccine would not be protective against the variants.
“It is a little worrisome that you see a lesser neutralizing antibody response, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that you are unprotected,” he said, noting that even these lower levels may still be enough to protect against serious infections.
“The goal of this vaccine is to keep you out of the hospital and to keep you out of the morgue. If you get a symptomatic infection or mildly symptomatic infection that is not a burden to the healthcare system,” Offit said.
Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE have also said tests showed their vaccine is effective against the variant found in Britain, but have not yet disclosed results against the South African variant.
That variant first found in Britain has caused a massive surge in cases there and has also been found in more than a dozen US states. US public health officials expect it to be the dominant variant in the United States within 6 weeks.",Reuters,"Jan 26, 2021 8:00 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/mix-male-female-brains-common-big-advantages-research/,‘Male’ vs ‘female’ brains: Having a mix of both is common and offers big advantages – new research,"From advertising to the workplace, it is often assumed that men and women are fundamentally different – from Mars and Venus, respectively. Of course, we all know people who are more androgynous, having a mix of personality traits that are stereotypically considered to be male or female. Importantly, such “psychological androgyny” has long been associated with traits such as better cognitive flexibility (the mental ability to shift between different tasks or thoughts), social competence and mental health.
But how does this relate to the brain? Are people who are more androgynous in their behavior going against their biological nature, doing things that their brains are not optimized for? It’s long been unknown whether there is such a thing as brain androgyny. But our new study, published in Cerebral Cortex, suggests it does exist – and it’s common.
Psychological androgyny is thought to be psychologically protective. For example, we know it is associated with fewer mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. It has also been linked to higher creativity.
We’re all familiar with the traits that are stereotypically classified as male or female. Men, for example, are not encouraged to express feelings or cry when upset. Instead they are expected to be tough, assertive, rational and good at visuospatial tasks such as map reading. Women, on the other hand, are often expected to be more emotional, nurturing and better at language.
But these differences are likely to be partly down to social norms and expectations – we all want to be liked, so we conform. If a girl is told that it is rude or unbecoming to be assertive, for example, she may change her behavior to accommodate this, affecting her future career choices. Female adolescents, for example, may not be encouraged by friends and family to consider rewarding but dangerous careers such as the military or policing.
Scientists have long argued over how different male and female brains really are. There are many reports of differences between male and female brains in the literature. Other researchers, however, argue that these differences are tiny and the categories are anything but absolute. One study suggested that, psychologically, most of us are in fact probably somewhere on a spectrum between what we stereotypically consider a “male” and a “female.”
But does that mean that the people who fall somewhere in the middle are more androgynous in their brains as well as their behavior? To test this, we created a brain continuum using a machine-learning algorithm and neuroimaging data. While male and female brains are similar, the connectivity between different brain areas have been shown to differ. We used these connectivity markers to characterize the brains of 9,620 participants (4,495 male and 5,125 female).
We discovered that brains were indeed distributed across the entire continuum rather than just at the two ends. In a subsample, approximately 25% of brains were identified as male, 25% as female and 50% were distributed across the androgynous section of the continuum. What’s more, we found that participants who mapped at the centre of this continuum, representing androgyny, had fewer mental health symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, compared with those at the two extreme ends.
These findings support our novel hypothesis that there exists a neuroimaging concept of brain androgyny, which may be associated with better mental health in a similar way to psychological androgyny.
To learn new things in order to adapt to the ever-changing global environment, we need to be able to be attentive to the world around us. We must also have mental wellbeing, flexibility, and be able to employ a wide range of life strategies.
These skills enable us to rapidly understand external context and decide on the optimal response. They help us take advantage of time-limited opportunities and instill resilience. Therefore, these skills confer an advantage for people with androgynous brains, with others being less likely to flourish.
But why is this the case? A meta-analysis of 78 studies of about 20,000 participants revealed that men who conform to typical masculine norms, for example never relying on others and exercising power over women, suffered more psychiatric symptoms than others, including depression, loneliness and substance abuse. They also felt more isolated, lacking social connections to others.
Women who try to conform pay a price too, perhaps opting out of their dream job because the industry is dominated by men or taking on the majority of tedious household chores. An androgynous person, however, is not influenced by gender norms to the same extent.
That doesn’t mean that there’s no hope for those at the extreme ends of the spectrum. The brain is changeable (plastic) to an extent. It is likely that the androgynous brain is influenced both by genetic and environmental factors, as well as an interaction between the two. Our own study suggests people’s level of brain androgyny may change over the life course.
Future research is required to understand the influences on brain androgyny across the life span and how environmental factors, such as education, may affect it. Given that we have found that an androgynous brain offers better mental health, it follows that, for optimal performance in school, work, and for better wellbeing throughout life, we need to avoid extreme stereotypes and offer children well-balanced opportunities as they grow up. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/coronavirus-variants-why-being-more-transmissible-rather-than-more-deadly-not-good-news/,Coronavirus variants: Why being more transmissible rather than more deadly isn’t good news,"Every time the coronavirus replicates, it has a chance to mutate. And given that it is currently rampaging around the world, it has plenty of opportunities to do just that.
Many mutations will make little or no difference to the virus’s ability to spread or cause more severe disease. Others will make it less likely to spread – those mutations are more likely to die out. But some will make the virus more deadly or more transmissible. These are the mutations we need to worry about.
On the afternoon of December 18, the UK government was alerted to the possibility that a new variant of the coronavirus circulating in the UK was 70% more transmissible than previously dominant variants.
Without any control measures (such as social distancing or wearing a mask), in a wholly susceptible population each person newly infected with the previously dominant variant of the virus would pass it on to three others (known as the basic reproduction number or R0). With a 70% increase in transmissibility, the number of people each person might infect, in the absence of control measures, increases to around five.
Fortunately, we have taken preventative measures to reduce the reproduction number (R) and slow the spread of the virus. However, even if these control measures were enough to reduce the previous variant’s R to 1 (the critical value below which infections start to fall), they would only reduce the new variant’s R to 1.7. Every 10people infected would infect 17 others and infections would spread exponentially.
In short, this increased transmissibility looked like really bad news. The hard lockdown the UK undertook last spring was thought to be enough to reduce R for the old variant to around 0.6. A 70% increase in transmissibility would mean that it was questionable whether even restrictions as tight as the ones the UK implemented in the spring of 2020 would be enough to suppress the spread of the new variant.
As more has become known, this estimate of increased transmissibility has begun to be revised down. A follow-up study from researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine – which is yet to be published in a scientific journal – suggested that the variant might be between 50% to 70% more transmissible. A more recent investigation from Public Health England suggested that the variant may only be between 30% to 50% more transmissible. This might explain why the UK’s current lockdown, which is less stringent than the first lockdown, has been enough to bring cases of this more transmissible variant down. Whatever the exact figure, there is little doubt that the new variant is significantly more transmissible.
As new variants (particularly B117) take hold in countries around the world, there are 3 things we should be worried about: first, whether the new variants are more transmissible; second, whether they are more deadly, and third, whether they are able to evade the COVID vaccines that are currently being rolled out.
There is no evidence to suggest that the UK variant makes any of the approved vaccines less effective, (although there is reason to believe the new South African variant may render existing immunity less effective). There is also no reason to think that B117 is any more deadly than other variants.
Indeed, news of the increased transmissibility of the new variant is often accompanied by a seemingly reassuring mention that the variant is not more deadly. Many news outlets have cited the “law of declining virulence,” which suggests that a more transmissible variant will be associated with milder illness. The idea behind the theory is that viruses that evolve to be more deadly will wipe out their host before being passed on, limiting chains of transmission and causing the variant to die out.
Unfortunately, given the long infectious period of COVID-19, the potential for asymptomatic transmission, and the length of time between infection and death, there is no reason why this rule of thumb should hold. But given that we have a more transmissible variant that does not appear to be more deadly, should we be happier about this than if it were the other way around?
In fact, even a 30% more transmissible variant can be way worse than a variant that is 30% more deadly. At the heart of this counter-intuitive assertion lies an old foe that has plagued us right from the start of this pandemic: exponential growth. Here’s a simple thought experiment that helps to explain why.
Imagine the old variant spreading under measures that have reduced R to 1. Starting with 10,000 infected people, every generation interval (time becoming infected and infecting someone else) they will infect 10,000 more. Of everyone that gets infected, let’s assume that 1% of them will die. After 10 generations, 100,000 new infections will have occurred leading to 1,000 deaths.
With a variant that is 30% more deadly, the same number of infections will occur, but they will lead to 1,300 deaths. Yet with a variant that is 30% more transmissible but not more deadly, because cases will grow exponentially, the eventual death toll over the same period stretches to over 4,200. The longer this goes on for, the bigger the death toll discrepancy between the more transmissible and the more deadly strain becomes.
While the above scenario is not intended to be completely realistic, it illustrates that a change in the rate at which the disease spreads exponentially can have a far more significant impact than the rate at which it kills. We shouldn’t take comfort when we hear of the emergence of new variants that are “more transmissible, but no more deadly.” – The Conversation | Rappler.com

India has cleared commercial exports of COVID-19 vaccines, with the first consignments to be shipped to Brazil and Morocco on Friday, January 22, the foreign secretary told Reuters.
The shots developed by British-based drugmaker AstraZeneca and Oxford University are being manufactured at the Serum Institute of India, the world’s biggest producer of vaccines, which has received orders from countries around the world.
Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said South Africa and Saudi Arabia would be next to get supplies. The Indian government had held off exporting doses until it began its own domestic immunization program last weekend.
Japan doubled down on its commitment to host the Tokyo Olympics this year and denied reports on Friday of a cancellation but that is unlikely to ease public concern about holding the event during a global pandemic.
A Japanese government spokesman said there was “no truth” to a report in the Times that the government had privately concluded the Tokyo Olympics would have to be cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Times, citing an unidentified senior member of the ruling coalition, said the government’s focus was on securing the Games for Tokyo in the next available year, 2032.
Japan has been hit less severely by the pandemic than many other advanced economies but a recent surge in cases has forced it to close its borders to non-resident foreigners and declare a state of emergency in Tokyo and other major cities. Tokyo has reported new daily coronavirus cases of more than 1,000 for 9 straight days through Thursday, January 21, and set a single-day record of more than 2,400 infections earlier in the month.
Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, said on Thursday,  that based on recent seven-day averages, coronavirus infections may be about to hit a plateau in the United States.
If 70% to 80% of Americans are vaccinated by the end of summer, he added, the country could experience “a degree of normality” by the fall.
Fauci praised US President Joe Biden’s willingness to “let the science speak” in contrast to the Trump administration, standing by his side on Thursday as Biden unveiled sweeping measures to battle COVID-19 on his first full day in office.
The European Commission proposed to EU leaders on Thursday identifying “dark red” coronavirus hot spots from which all but essential travel would be discouraged after a meeting to discuss the mounting challenge from more infectious virus variants.
EU leaders also agreed during a video conference that it should be possible to agree on common standards for vaccine certificates for medical purposes.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference after the meeting that countries should not close their borders, to ensure the functioning of the single market, including the flow of goods and travel for cross-border workers, but that the Commission would add a new “dark red” category to its traffic light indications of risk, for regions where the virus was circulating at a very high rate. Today, almost all of Europe is red.",Reuters,"Jan 22, 2021 2:20 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/german-scientists-make-paralyzed-mice-walk-again/,German scientists make paralyzed mice walk again,"German researchers have enabled mice paralyzed after spinal cord injuries to walk again, re-establishing a neural link hitherto considered irreparable in mammals by using a designer protein injected into the brain.
Spinal cord injuries in humans, often caused by sports or traffic accidents, leave them paralyzed because not all of the nerve fibers that carry information between muscles and the brain are able to grow back.
But the researchers from Ruhr University Bochum managed to stimulate the paralyzed mice’s nerve cells to regenerate using a designer protein.
“The special thing about our study is that the protein is not only used to stimulate those nerve cells that produce it themselves, but that it is also carried further (through the brain),” the team’s head Dietmar Fischer told Reuters in an interview.
“In this way, with a relatively small intervention, we stimulate a very large number of nerves to regenerate and that is ultimately the reason why the mice can walk again.”
The paralyzed rodents that received the treatment started walking after 2 to 3 weeks, he said.
The treatment involves injecting carriers of genetic information into the brain to produce the protein, called hyper-interleukin-6, according to the university’s website.
The team is investigating if the treatment can be improved.
“We also have to see if our method works on larger mammals. We would think of pigs, dogs, or primates, for example,” Fischer said.
“Then, if it works there, we would have to make sure that the therapy is safe for humans too. But that will certainly take many, many years.”",Reuters,"Jan 22, 2021 10:05 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-biontech-agree-supply-who-covid-19-vaccine-scheme/,Pfizer-BioNTech agree to supply WHO co-led COVID-19 vaccine scheme,"Pfizer and BioNTech have agreed to supply their COVID-19 vaccine to the World Health Organization co-led COVAX vaccine access scheme, two sources familiar with the deal said, the latest in a series of shots to be included in the project aimed at lower-income countries.
The deal is expected to be announced on Friday, January 22, according to the sources, who declined to be named due to the confidentiality of the agreement.
Details on the size of the deal or the price per dose COVAX would pay were not immediately clear, but the sources said the allotment would likely be relatively small. One source said the reason for the limited volume was that the doses were primarily meant for healthcare workers in the countries that COVAX serves.
BioNTech declined to comment while Pfizer did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for the WHO and the GAVI vaccine alliance, which co-leads the COVAX scheme, also declined to comment.
Senior WHO adviser Bruce Aylward said on Monday the COVAX scheme was in “very detailed discussions” with Pfizer, which has already committed hundreds of millions of doses this year to several wealthy nations, and expected to be able to include the vaccine in COVAX “very soon.”
The COVAX scheme is set to start distributing COVID-19 vaccines to poor and middle income countries in February.
Ukraine said earlier on Thursday that its first delievery of COVID-19 vaccine under the COVAX scheme could arrive in the first half on February – with 210,000 doses of either the Moderna, Pfizer, or AstraZeneca vaccines.
COVAX has said it hopes to deliver more than 2 billion COVID-19 doses across the world this year. In an updated forecast published on Thursday, it said it planned to deliver around 1.8 billion doses in 2021 to 92 poorer countries, covering around 27% of their populations.
The scheme – led by the WHO, the GAVI vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) – was set up last year amid concerns that poorer nations would lose out while rich countries scrambled to procure COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate their populations.
COVAX has so far secured future vaccine suplies from AstraZeneca, working with Oxford University; the Serum Institute of India (SII); as well as with Sanofi and its partner GSK. It also has a memorandum of understanding over deliveries from Johnson & Johnson.
The Pfizer deal would be COVAX’s second, after the one with AstraZeneca, that covers a product with regulatory approval in some countries.
The additional commitment by Pfizer comes as frustration grows in European countries over the US drugmaker’s unexpected cut in supplies. Pfizer said last week it would reduce deliveries until early February to upgrade production capacity for a later output boost.
The Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is the only shot so far to have WHO emergency use listing approval.
On Wednesday, Reuters reported that the WHO plans to approve several COVID-19 vaccines from Western and Chinese manufacturers in the coming weeks and months as it aims for rapid rollouts in poorer countries.
BioNTech and Pfizer said this month they were aiming to deliver 2 billion vaccine doses this year, up from a previous goal of 1.3 billion.
Their shot is more complicated to transport and store, requiring ultra-cold freezers, which may not be practical for poorer countries with hot climates.",Reuters,"Jan 22, 2021 9:53 AM PHT"

China plans to impose strict COVID testing requirements during the Lunar New Year holiday season, when tens of millions of people are expected to travel, as it battles the worst wave of new infections since March 2020.
In a notice posted online, China’s National Health Commission said people returning to rural areas from other provinces over the Lunar New Year period would have to produce a negative COVID-19 test taken within 7 days.
Those that work with imported cold chain products, or quarantine facility workers, among other groups, would also have to produce a test, even if they remained in the same province, said the notice. Rural areas’ epidemic control, as well as infections spread via imported frozen goods, have been blamed by officials as weak links partially responsible for the current outbreaks.
President Joe Biden signed his first order at the White House on Wednesday, January 20, to require masks and physical distancing in all federal buildings and the development of a testing program for federal employees for COVID-19, in a first step to combat a pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than 400,000 Americans.
In October, Biden vowed to require masks on airplanes and on interstate transportation, but he did not take that action on Wednesday. The transportation order is expected Thursday, officials said.
The Biden administration must implement new testing requirements for nearly all international air passengers that begin Tuesday, following a CDC order last week. Under the new rules, all US-bound passengers age 2 and over must get negative COVID-19 test results within three calendar days of travel.
As embattled Tokyo Olympics organizers enter the final 6 months of preparations for the delayed Games on Saturday, virus experts believe hosting the world’s biggest sporting event may be too big a gamble.
“We are facing far more danger than last year, so why do you have to hold the Olympic Games, cancelled last year due to risk of infections, this year?,” Kentaro Iwata, a prominent infectious diseases expert from Kobe University, who rose to prominence with videos criticizing the quarantine of the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February, told Reuters.
Organizers have maintained that postponing the Games for another year is not on the table, leaving complete cancellation or striving ahead as the only options.
A third pandemic lockdown appears to be having little impact on rates of COVID-19 in England, researchers warned on Thursday, January 21, with prevalence of the disease “very high” and “no evidence of decline” in the first 10 days of renewed restrictions.
Until rates of COVID-19 are reduced substantially, health services “will remain under extreme pressure” and the number of deaths will continue to rise rapidly, researchers leading Imperial College London’s REACT-1 prevalence study said.
Paul Elliott, an expert in epidemiology and public health medicine and director of the REACT program, said the stubborn levels of COVID-19 infection may be in part due to a more transmissible variant of the virus which emerged late last year. “We’ve really got to double down on the public health measures –wear face covers, keep your distance and wash your hands,” Elliott said.",Rappler.com,"Jan 21, 2021 3:14 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-vaccine-appears-effective-against-coronavirus-variant-britain/,Pfizer vaccine appears effective against coronavirus variant found in Britain – study,"The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech is likely to protect against a more infectious variant of the virus discovered in Britain which has spread around the world, according to results of further lab tests released on Wednesday.
The encouraging results from an analysis of blood of participants in trials are based on more extensive analysis than those released by the US drugmaker last week.
Last week, Pfizer said a similar laboratory study showed the vaccine was effective against one key mutation, called N501Y, found in two highly transmissible new variants spreading in Britain and South Africa.
The latest study, posted on bioRxiv.org but not yet peer reviewed, was conducted on a synthetic virus with 10 mutations that are characteristic of the variant known as B117 identified in Britain.
Among the 11 authors of the study are Ugur Sahin and Oezlem Tuereci, co-founders of BioNTech. Sahin is chief executive and his wife Tuereci is chief medical officer.
It provides further hope as record numbers of daily deaths from COVID-19 are reported in Britain, which is believed to be driven by the more transmissible variant. It also means vaccine development would for now not have to start all over again.
But the virus needs to be continuously monitored to check that changes maintain protection by vaccines, the study said.
For the test, blood samples drawn from 16 vaccinated participants in prior clinical trials were exposed to a synthetic virus called pseudovirus which was engineered to have the same surface proteins as B117, as characterized by 10 hallmark mutations.
The antibodies in the blood of the volunteers given the vaccine, known as Comirnaty, or BNT162b2, neutralized the pseudovirus as effectively as the older coronavirus version that the product was initially designed for.
Experts said the findings were reassuring and not surprising and results from similar studies on the South African variant would be keenly watched.
“This makes it very unlikely that the UK variant will escape from the protection provided by the vaccine,” said Jonathan Stoye, a specialist in virus science at Britain’s Francis Crick Institute. “It will be interesting to carry out the same experiments with the South African variant.”
BioNTech has said it plans to publish a more detailed analysis of the likely effect of its vaccine on the South African variant within a few days.
The world is pinning its hopes on vaccines to rein in the coronavirus, first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019, as many countries impose tighter and longer lockdowns to try to bring the pandemic under control.
The variants are said by scientists to be more transmissible than previously dominant ones, but they are not thought to cause more serious illness.
“The South African strain has been detected in the UK – albeit currently in small numbers – but does seem to be increasing in recent weeks,” said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia.
“Variants with this mutation could reduce vaccine efficacy, though most likely all current vaccines would still be highly effective.”
Experts have called for continued testing to establish whether vaccines will protect people as the virus mutates. COVID-19 has killed more than 2 million people worldwide.
Preparation for potential COVID-19 vaccine strain changes would be “prudent”, the study said on Wednesday.
The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the one from Moderna Inc, which both use synthetic messenger RNA technology, or mRNA, can be quickly adapted to address new mutations in the coronavirus if necessary. Scientists have suggested the changes could be made in as little as six weeks.
AstraZeneca, Moderna and CureVac are also testing whether their respective shots will protect against the fast-spreading variants. They have not released the results of those tests.",Reuters,"Jan 20, 2021 8:37 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/previous-coronavirus-infection-may-offer-less-protection-new-variant/,Previous coronavirus infection may offer less protection from new variant,"Previous infection with the coronavirus may offer less protection against the new variant first identified in South Africa, scientists said on Monday, January 18, although they hope that vaccines will still work.
Studies also found that the new variant binds more strongly and readily to human cells. That helps explain why it seems to be spreading around 50% quicker than previous versions, leading South African epidemiologist Salim Abdool Karim said.
The 501Y.V2 variant was identified by South African genomics experts late last year. It has been the main driver of a second wave of national COVID-19 infections, which hit a new daily peak above 21,000 cases earlier this month.
It is one of several new variants found in recent months, including others first discovered in England and Brazil, which scientists worry are hastening the spread of COVID-19.
“Convalescent serum studies suggest natural antibodies are less effective,” Abdool Karim said, introducing the research, “(but) current data suggest the new variant is not more severe.”
British scientists and politicians have expressed concern that vaccines currently being deployed or in development could be less effective against the variant.
Scientists speaking at the virtual panel on Monday said there was not yet a clear answer to that question and that studies were continuing.
“We have reason to be concerned because the virus has found a way to escape from previous antibodies,” Alex Sigal, a virologist at the Africa Health Research Institute, said.
“The world has underestimated this virus. This virus can evolve, it…is adapting to us.”
Earlier, South African researchers said that since vaccines induce a broad immune response it was unlikely that the mutations in the spike protein of the variant would completely negate their effect.
The researchers reiterated that notion on Monday.
“Our immune systems are extraordinarily clever,” Willem Hanekom, one of the team, said. “There may be compensation through other arms of the immune system that allow vaccines to still work.”
The 501Y.V2 variant has spread to nations in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, as well as several other African countries, causing some states to impose restrictions on travel to and from South Africa.",Reuters,"Jan 19, 2021 10:41 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/are-brains-atheists-different-religious-people/,Are the brains of atheists different to those of religious people? Scientists are trying to find out,"The cognitive study of religion has recently reached a new, unknown land: the minds of unbelievers. Do atheists think differently from religious people? Is there something special about how their brains work? To illustrate what they’ve found, I will focus on 3 key snapshots.
The first one, from 2003, is probably the most photogenic moment of “neuro-atheism.” Biologist and atheist Richard Dawkins traveled to the lab of Canadian neuroscientist Michael Persinger in the hope of having a religious experience. In this BBC Horizon film, God on the Brain, a retro science-fiction helmet was placed on Dawkins head. This “god helmet” generated weak magnetic fields, applied to the temporal lobes.
Persinger had previously shown that this kind of stimulation triggered a wide range of religious phenomena – from sensing the presence of someone invisible to prompting out-of-body experiences. With Dawkins, though, the experiment failed. As it turned out, Persinger explained, Dawkins’ temporal lobe sensitivity was “much, much lower” than is common in most people.
The idea that the temporal lobes may be the seat of religious experience has been around since the 1960s. But this was the first time that the hypothesis was extended to explain the lack of religious experience based on the lower sensitivity of a brain region. Despite the exciting possibility of testing this hypothesis with a larger sample of atheists, it remains to be done.
The second snapshot takes us to 2012. Three articles published by labs in the USA and Canada presented the first evidence linking an analytical, logical thinking style to unbelief. Psychologists have been theorizing about different ways that brains process information for a long time: conscious versus unconscious, reflective versus experiential, analytical versus intuitive. These are linked to activity in certain brain areas, and can be triggered by stimuli including art. The researchers asked participants to contemplate Rodin’s famous sculpture, The Thinker, and then assessed their analytical thinking and disbelief in god. They found that those who had viewed the sculpture performed better on the analytical thinking task and reported less belief in god than people who hadn’t seen the image.
In the same year, a Finnish lab published the results of a study where their scientists tried to provoke atheists into thinking supernaturally by presenting them with a series of short stories and asking if the punchline was a “sign of the universe” (interpreting something as a “sign” is more supernatural than interpreting something as, for example, a coincidence). They did this while scanning their brains using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The more the participants suppressed supernatural thinking, the stronger the activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus was. We know this area is involved in cognitive inhibition, an ability to refrain from certain thoughts and behaviours.
Together, these studies suggest that atheists have a propensity to engage more in analytical or reflective thinking. If believing in gods is intuitive, then this intuition can be overridden by more careful thinking. This finding certainly raised the possibility that the minds of atheists are simply different from those of believers.
So how robust are the findings? In 2015, a “replication crisis” hit the field of psychology. It turned out that the results of many classic studies couldn’t be achieved when running them again. The psychology of religion and atheism was no exception.
The experiment with Rodin’s Thinker was the first to be investigated. Three new studies were conducted with larger samples than the original — and they all failed to replicate the original results. With one sample, they found the very opposite: contemplating the Thinker increased religious belief.
One possible limitation with the original studies is that they had all been undertaken in the USA. Could culture act in such a decisive way that the analytical cognitive style associated with atheism in one country might be nonexistent elsewhere? The author of the original Rodin study attempted to answer this in a new study which included individuals from 13 countries. The results confirmed that a cognitive analytical style was only linked to atheism in 3 countries: Australia, Singapore, and the USA.
In 2017, a double-blind study was carried out to test in a more robust way the link between unbelief and cognitive inhibition. Instead of using brain imaging to see which area lit up, they used a brain stimulation technique to directly stimulate the area responsible for cognitive inhibition: the right inferior frontal gyrus. Half of the participants, however were given a fake stimulus. The results showed that the brain stimulation worked: participants who had it achieved better in a cognitive inhibition task. However, this had no effect on decreasing supernatural belief.
The third snapshot is this one: a man is standing against a background which looks like a church. He appears to be doing the sign of the cross with his right hand while his left hand rests on his heart. He is a priest – but not of any church that believes in gods: he presides over the Positivist Temple of Humanity, a church for atheists and agnostics created by August Comte in the 19th century. This priest is not doing the sign of cross but the Positivist blessing.
Together with photographer Aubrey Wade, I stumbled upon this active temple in the south of Brazil, while collecting data for a large ongoing project involving over 20 labs across the world: Understanding Unbelief.
Finding an active church of unbelievers dedicated to the love of humanity — its golden principle being “live for others” — ruptured how I thought of atheists and the boundary separating them from the religious. And this has implications for how we develop studies in this area. When doing experiments with believers we can use multiple stimuli, from religious images to music, to trigger a religious effect or cognition in the lab. But finding an equivalent for unbelievers has proved hard.
One brain imaging study conducted at Oxford University compared an image of the Virgin Mary with that of a regular woman, both painted in the same period. Researchers found that when Roman Catholics concentrated on the Virgin Mary while being subjected to electric shocks, this alleviated their perception of pain compared to looking at the other woman. This decrease in pain was associated with an engagement of the right ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, a region known to drive pain inhibitory circuits.
No similar effect was found for the unbelievers, although they rated the secular image as more pleasant than the religious one. But what if the unbelievers being tested were members of the Positivist Temple and were instead shown an image of their goddess of humanity — would this have alleviated pain in a similar way to that experienced by the religious individuals?
The future cognitive science of atheism will have to think hard about how to move forward. It needs to develop models that account for cultural variations as well as consider the implications of atheists engaging with rituals that celebrate humanity.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/china-says-latest-covid-19-outbreak-caused-by-imported-cases/,China says latest COVID-19 outbreak caused by imported cases,"China’s recent COVID-19 outbreaks in the northeast have come from travelers entering the country or contaminated frozen food imports, the National Health Commission (NHC) said on Saturday, January 16.
NHC Minister Ma Xiaowei made the comments at a government meeting, where he also said the virus was spreading to rural areas and that the handling of the recent situation had exposed how prevention and control measures had been relaxed.
“Since December 2020, epidemic clusters have occurred in Beijing, Sichuan, Liaoning, Hebei and Heilongjiang,” a statement posted on the NHC’s website said citing the briefing by Ma.
“They mainly have the following characteristics. Firstly, they are all imported from abroad, caused by travelers from overseas, or contaminated cold-chain imported items.”
Total case numbers remain well below what China saw at the height of the outbreak in early 2020, but concerns about a new wave are growing with the Lunar New Year a month away.
This surge comes as a World Health Organization-led (WHO) team of investigators are in quarantine in the city of Wuhan, where the disease was first detected in late 2019. The team aims to investigate the origins of the pandemic that has now killed nearly 2 million people worldwide.
China is the only country to claim COVID-19 can be transmitted via cold chain imports, even though the WHO has downplayed the risks, and has been pushing a narrative via state media that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered late last year in the central city of Wuhan.
The country has in the past week seen the number of daily cases jump to an over 10-month high, and for January 15 reported 130 new coronavirus cases in the mainland, versus 144 cases a day earlier.
Of those cases, 115 were local infections, 90 of which were in Hebei province surrounding Beijing that has been hit hardest in the latest wave.
Another 23 cases were found in northeastern Heilongjiang province while two cases were reported in Beijing. The authority also reported 79 new asymptomatic patients, which it does not classify as confirmed cases, were found on January 15 compared with 66 a day earlier.
About 28 million people have been put under lockdown so far as a result and Ma said the latest outbreak had quickly spread widely due to activities such as wedding banquets or large group gatherings, and that it was difficult to control as community transmission had already occurred when cases were discovered.
Xinhua warned on Saturday, however, that government officials should not “cry wolf” and be too quick to declare that they are entering “wartime mode,” saying that it could increase unnecessary panic and affect normal production.

More than a dozen doctors, experts and health officials told Reuters authorities were slow to expand testing and said officials still lack real-time data on testing numbers. That raises questions about Japan’s grasp of its own testing capabilities, just months before the planned Olympics.
Japan will also suspend exemptions allowing foreign athletes to train in the country ahead of the Summer Olympics, Kyodo News reported, as it closes its borders to contain a surge in COVID-19 cases 6 months before the Games.
China reported the highest number of daily COVID-19 cases in more than 10 months, official data showed on Friday, January 15, due to a severe outbreak in the northeast that has put more than 28 million people under lockdown.
Fearing more infections, lost profits and possible lockdowns, China’s local governments and factories are offering incentives to persuade workers not to go home for the Lunar New Year holiday in February.
Officials have expressed concern that the outbreak in Hebei province has been largely in rural areas, where medical infrastructure is weaker and control measures harder to enforce. Feng Zijian, deputy director of the China Center for Disease Control, warned that the Hebei outbreak had been spreading faster than previous ones.
China is stealing a march on Western drugmakers in the COVID-19 vaccine race in developing nations, with Indonesia and Turkey rolling out huge campaigns with a Chinese shot this week, Brazil to follow soon, and even EU member Hungary signing up.
Scientists in some Western countries say China has been too slow to publish trial data. Public reports about how well its vaccines work have been inconsistent, which the Chinese firms attribute to variations in methodology.
Still, countries with hundreds of millions of people desperate for a vaccine think China’s shots are good enough.
Across the United States, many teachers are not eligible to receive the vaccine. The lack of a federal blueprint for mass inoculation has left individual states to decide who gets the shots and when.
It is yet another example of the unevenness that has characterized the national effort to tackle the pandemic. Many of the 50 million public school students in the United States are still taking classes online, almost a year after the virus shut down schools nationwide.
While teachers in some states wait to be vaccinated, some of them say they are being pressed to return to the classroom during a surge in COVID-19 infections.",Reuters,"Jan 15, 2021 3:04 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/study-covid-19-infection-gives-some-immunity-but-virus-can-still-be-spread/,"COVID-19 infection gives some immunity, but virus can still be spread – study","People who have had COVID-19 are highly likely to have immunity to it for at least 5 months, but there is evidence that those with antibodies may still be able to carry and spread the virus, a study of British healthcare workers has found.
Preliminary findings by scientists at Public Health England (PHE) showed that reinfections in people who have COVID-19 antibodies from a past infection are rare – with only 44 cases found among 6,614 previously infected people in the study.
But experts cautioned that the findings mean people who contracted the disease in the first wave of the pandemic in the early months of 2020 may now be vulnerable to catching it again.
They also warned that people with so-called natural immunity – acquired through having had the infection – may still be able carry the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in their nose and throat and could unwittingly pass it on.
“We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total and we do not yet know how long protection lasts,” said Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE and co-leader of the study, whose findings were published on Thursday, January 14.
“This means even if you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections. But there is still a risk you could acquire an infection and transmit (it) to others.”
Experts not directly involved in the research, which is known as the SIREN study, urged people to note its key findings.
“These data reinforce the message that, for the time being, everyone is a potential source of infection for others and should behave accordingly,” said Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at Edinburgh University.
Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at Reading University, said the study “has major implications for how we can get out of the current crisis.”
“This means that the vast majority of the population will either need to have natural immunity or have been immunized for us to fully lift restrictions on our lives, unless we are prepared to see many more people being infected and dying from COVID-19,” he said.
PHE said in a statement that the study had not been able to explore antibody or other immune responses to the COVID-19 vaccines being rolled out in Britain. Vaccine effects would be studied as part of SIREN later this year, it said.
The SIREN study involves tens of thousands of healthcare workers in Britain who have been tested regularly since June for new COVID-19 infections as well as for the presence of antibodies.
Between June 18 and November 24, scientists found 44 potential reinfections – two “probable” and 42 “possible” – among 6,614 participants who had tested positive for antibodies. This represents an 83% rate of protection from reinfection, they said.
The researchers said they would continue to follow the participants to see if this natural immunity might last longer than 5 months in some. But they said early evidence from the next stage of the study suggested some people with immunity could still carry high levels of virus.",Reuters,"Jan 14, 2021 10:33 PM PHT"

A global team of scientists led by the World Health Organization arrived in China’s central city of Wuhan, where COVID-19 first surfaced in late 2019, to investigate the origins of the pandemic, state television said on Thursday, January 14.
Hung Nguyen, a Vietnamese biologist and part of the 10-member team, told Reuters that he did not expect any restrictions on the group’s work in China. He hoped to find new details about the virus’ origins, but said the team may not find clear answers.
The team will spend two weeks in quarantine on arrival and two more weeks interviewing people from research institutes, hospitals and the seafood market in Wuhan where the new pathogen is believed to have emerged, Hung said.
China reported its biggest daily jump in new COVID-19 cases in more than 10 months as infections in northeastern Heilongjiang province nearly tripled, underscoring the growing threat ahead of the major national Lunar New Year holiday.
The National Health Commission said in a statement that 138 new COVID-19 cases were reported on January 13, up from 115 cases a day earlier and marking the highest jump since March 5. China also reported one new death, marking the first increase in the death toll since mid-May.
The new wave of infections comes ahead of next month’s holiday, when hundreds of millions of people typically travel to their hometowns. COVID-19’s resurgence has already prompted some provinces to discourage travel, which could lead to reduced travel and dampen consumption during the long break.
Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said on Thursday she was considering the use of remote mining camps to quarantine international arrivals, aiming to break a cycle of coronavirus outbreaks around Australia at city hotels used for isolation. Neighboring Northern Territory began using a shuttered mining camp outside the city of Darwin in October for quarantining international arrivals.
A proposal for wider use of camps is on the agenda of a national cabinet meeting next week but New South Wales, the country’s most populous state, has already voiced its objections. The vast majority of incoming travellers to Australia arrive in Sydney where they are quarantined at city hotels.
“There’s strong views held in our public health team it makes sense to continue to have the hotel quarantine arrangements we currently have,” said NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard, citing difficulties in providing support staff in regional locations and concerns about transporting infected travellers.
The microscopic organisms living in our intestines may influence the severity of COVID-19 and the body’s immune response to it, and could account for lingering symptoms, researchers reported on Monday in the journal Gut.
“COVID patients lack certain good bacteria known to regulate our immune system,” said Dr Siew Ng of The Chinese University of Hong Kong. The presence of an abnormal assortment of gut bacteria, or “dysbiosis,” persists after the virus is gone and could play a role in the long-lasting symptoms that plague some patients, she said.
Her team has developed an oral formula of live bacteria known as probiotics and a special capsule to protect the organisms until they reach the gut. Ng added that those who got it had significantly reduced markers for inflammation in their blood, increased favorable bacteria in their stool and they developed neutralizing antibodies to the virus.",Reuters,"Jan 14, 2021 1:58 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/second-year-pandemic-could-even-be-tougher-who/,Second year of pandemic ‘could even be tougher’ – WHO,"The second year of the COVID-19 pandemic may be tougher than the first given how the new coronavirus is spreading, especially in the northern hemisphere as more infectious variants circulate, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday, January 13.
“We are going into a second year of this, it could even be tougher given the transmission dynamics and some of the issues that we are seeing,” Mike Ryan, the WHO’s top emergencies official, said during an event on social media.
The worldwide death toll is approaching 2 million people since the pandemic began, with 91.5 million people infected.
The WHO, in its latest epidemiological update issued overnight, said after two weeks of fewer cases being reported, some 5 million new cases were reported last week, the likely result of a letdown of defenses during the holiday season in which people – and the virus – came together.
“Certainly in the northern hemisphere, particularly in Europe and North America we have seen that sort of perfect storm of the season – coldness, people going inside, increased social mixing, and a combination of factors that have driven increased transmission in many, many countries,” Ryan said.
Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead for COVID-19, warned: “After the holidays, in some countries the situation will get a lot worse before it gets better.”
Amid growing fears of the more contagious coronavirus variant first detected in Britain but now entrenched worldwide, governments across Europe on Wednesday announced tighter, longer coronavirus restrictions.
That includes home-office requirements and store closures in Switzerland, an extended Italian COVID-19 state of emergency, and German efforts to further reduce contacts between people blamed for failed efforts, so far, to get the coronavirus under control.
“I worry that we will remain in this pattern of peak and trough and peak and trough, and we can do better,” Van Kerkhove said.
She called for maintaining physical distancing, adding: “The further, the better…but make sure that you keep that distance from people outside your immediate household.”",Reuters,"Jan 14, 2021 9:12 AM PHT"

The vaccine was just 50.4% effective at preventing symptomatic infections in the Brazilian trial, including data on “very mild” cases, researchers said on Tuesday, January 12.
Last week, they said the vaccine, called CoronaVac, showed 78% efficacy against “mild-to-severe” cases.
The news prompted Malaysia and Singapore, which have purchase agreements with Sinovac, to say on Wednesday that they would seek more data from the Chinese firm on efficacy rates before they approved and bought supplies.
“These Phase III clinical trial results are sufficient to prove that CoronaVac vaccine’s safety and effectiveness are good around the world,” Sinovac Biotech Chairman Yin Weidong told a news conference.
Different countries used vaccines from the same batch in their trials, but the countries don’t have identical testing protocols, he said.
Piecemeal disclosures from Sinovac’s trials as well as those from studies of other Chinese vaccines have raised concerns that they are not subject to the same public scrutiny as US and European alternatives.
The data from Brazil was released just as Indonesia rolled its vaccination campaign, with President Joko Widodo being the first to be inoculated with Sinovac’s CoronaVac.
Malaysia said on Wednesday it would only go ahead with procurement if the vaccine satisfied the safety and efficacy standards of local regulators.
On Tuesday, Malaysia’s Pharmaniaga Bhd signed a deal with Sinovac to purchase 14 million doses of CoronaVac and later to manufacture it domestically.
Singapore, the only high-income nation with which Sinovac has struck a deal, said it would go through official data when Sinovac releases it, rather than depending on efficacy reported so far, and then decide whether to approve it.
Thailand, which has ordered 2 million doses of CoronaVac said it was still on track to receive and administer the vaccine starting next month, but added it would ask for information directly from Sinovac.",Reuters,"Jan 13, 2021 9:13 PM PHT"

China has recorded the biggest daily rise in coronavirus cases in more than 5 months, despite 4 cities in lockdown, increased testing and other measures aimed at preventing another wave of infections in the world’s second-biggest economy.
Most of the new patients were reported near the capital, Beijing, but a northeastern province also saw a rise in new cases, official data showed on Wednesday, January 13, amid a resurgence that has seen more than 28 million people confined to home quarantine.
The state planning agency has said it expects travel over next month’s Lunar New Year to be markedly lower than normal, with a bigger share of people taking cars instead of other forms of transport. Many provinces have asked migrant workers not to travel during the break.
President Joko Widodo became the first person in Indonesia to get a COVID-19 vaccine shot on Wednesday, as the government launched an ambitious vaccination campaign in a bid to stem one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Asia.
The drive aims to inoculate 181.5 million people, with the first to be vaccinated receiving the CoronaVac vaccine from China’s Sinovac Biotech, which Indonesia authorized for emergency use on Monday, January 11. Minister of Health Budi Gunadi Sadikin, who was also due to be vaccinated on Wednesday, has said two-thirds of the 270 million population must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.
Indonesia has said its trials showed CoronaVac has an efficacy rate of 65.3%, but Brazilian researchers said on Tuesday the vaccine was only 50.4% effective.
Japan plans to expand a state of emergency it declared for the Tokyo area last week to 7 more prefectures on Wednesday, media reported, as hopes for a Summer Olympics fade with the steady spread of COVID-19.
As coronavirus infections hover at record-high levels in a third wave in Japan, opinion polls have shown a public increasingly opposed to holding the Summer Games this year – and growing frustration with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.
The expected addition of Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Fukuoka, Aichi, Gifu and Tochigi prefectures to a state of emergency would cover about 55% of the population of 126 million. The latest emergency declaration is set to last through February 7 and is much narrower in scope than the first one last spring. It focuses on combating transmission in bars and restaurants, while urging people to stay home as much as possible.
The upheaval in global labor markets triggered by the coronavirus will transform the working lives of millions of employees for good, policymakers and business leaders told a Reuters virtual forum. Nearly a year after governments first imposed lockdowns to contain the virus, there is a growing consensus that more staff will in future be hired remotely, work from home and have an entirely different set of expectations of their managers.
Chris Hyams, CEO of the global jobs listings website Indeed, said though there were already signs that some sectors were now ready to allow up to 70% of their workforces to operate remotely all the time, such benefits would often be reserved for better-educated white-collar workers.",Reuters,"Jan 13, 2021 2:19 PM PHT"

Sao Paulo’s Butantan biomedical center, which partnered with Sinovac to test and produce the vaccine in Brazil, dismissed the report as “purely speculative” as it prepares to release a more complete set of results on Tuesday at 12:45 pm. (1545 GMT).
Medical experts and regulators criticized what they called an incomplete disclosure of study results last week.
Dimas Covas, director of the Butantan biomedical center, which is running a late-stage trial of the vaccine in Brazil, said ongoing analysis had yielded a new “general efficacy” rate in addition to the “clinical efficacy” announced last week.
On Thursday, Brazilian researchers said the vaccine was shown to be 78% effective against mild cases of COVID-19 and entirely prevented severe cases. But independent specialists called for more transparency on the findings from the Phase III trial of the Sinovac vaccine, known as CoronaVac.
Indonesia gave the vaccine emergency use approval on Monday based on interim data showing it is 65% effective.
Brazilian news website UOL reported that the efficacy rate that Butantan was set to announce on Tuesday was between 50% and 60% — above the threshold set by health regulators, but well below the numbers celebrated last week.
Both the Chinese vaccine and a shot developed by Oxford University and British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca have requests for emergency use authorization pending with regulators in Brazil, which has lost more than 200,000 lives to the pandemic – the worst death toll outside the United States.
Piecemeal disclosure of results from global CoronaVac studies have contributed to concerns that vaccines developed by Chinese producers are not subject to the same public scrutiny as US and European alternatives.
In an interview with news website UOL on Monday, Covas said Butantan, which is funded by Sao Paulo state, had prioritized getting its data to Brazilian health regulator Anvisa and was still analyzing the results in parallel.
Covas said the institute would eventually provide its full data to a scientific conference to be announced this week.
Anvisa said on Saturday that a filing from Butantan seeking emergency use authorization for CoronaVac lacked some relevant information for analysis of the study, such as the age, gender, and comorbidities of volunteers.
Covas said the federal agency’s handling of the CoronaVac trial had raised questions about its independence, adding to tensions between Sao Paulo officials and the government of President Jair Bolsonaro, who had spurned the Chinese vaccine.",Reuters,"Jan 12, 2021 9:06 AM PHT"

Governor Gavin Newsom, in his latest coronavirus update for the state, said the source of the gorillas’ infection was still under investigation to determine whether the virus was transmitted between animals or from humans to the apes.
A statement posted on the San Diego Zoo Safari Park website said the gorillas were suspected of having contracted infection “from an asymptomatic staff member,” despite following all COVID-19 safety precautions recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Zoo authorities initiated testing of fecal samples of the park’s gorillas after two of the apes began coughing last Wednesday, and preliminary results two days later found the presence of the virus “in the gorilla troop,” the statement said.
The US Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the positive results on Monday.
“The test results confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in some of the gorillas and does not definitively rule out the presence of the virus in other members of the troop,” it said.
“Aside from some congestion and coughing, the gorillas are doing well,” Lisa Peterson, executive director of the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, said in the statement. “The troop remains quarantined together and are eating and drinking. We are hopeful for a full recovery.”
Gorillas are members of the family of primates known as the great apes, or hominids, that also include orangutans, chimpanzees, and humans.
The coronavirus has also been found in a number of other wild animal species in captivity, including several lions and tigers at the Bronx Zoo in New York and 4 lions at the Barcelona Zoo in Spain.
But the gorillas in San Diego are believed to mark the first known case of infections confirmed in apes. The virus also has shown up in a number of household dogs and cats.
Last month, the USDA said it had confirmed the first known case of the coronavirus in an animal in the wild, a mink, following an outbreak among farmed minks that killed 15,000 of the animals.",Reuters,"Jan 12, 2021 8:35 AM PHT"

The not-yet peer reviewed study by Pfizer and scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch indicated the vaccine was effective in neutralizing virus with the so-called N501Y mutation of the spike protein.
The mutation could be responsible for greater transmissibility and there had been concern it could also make the virus escape antibody neutralization elicited by the vaccine, said Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer’s top viral vaccine scientists.
So we’ve now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That’s the good news… That doesn’t mean that the 17th won’t.
A Pfizer viral scientist
The study was conducted on blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine. Its findings are limited, because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in either of the new variants of the rapidly spreading virus.
Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the mutation, as well as 15 other mutations the company has previously tested against.
“So we’ve now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That’s the good news,” he said. “That doesn’t mean that the 17th won’t.”
Dormitzer noted another mutation found in the South African variant, called the E484K mutation, is also concerning.
The researchers plan to run similar tests to see if the vaccine is effective against other mutations found in the UK and South African variants and hope to have more data within weeks.
Scientists have expressed concern that vaccines being rolled out may not be able to protect against the new variants, particularly the one that emerged in South Africa.
Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said this week that while both variants had some new features in common, the one found in South Africa “has a number additional mutations” that included more extensive alterations to the spike protein.

The US biotech company, which stunned the world last year by coming up with a vaccine against the disease caused by the new coronavirus in just a few weeks, received approval for its shot from the European Commission on Wednesday, January 6.
Given vaccines development and pharmacovigilance usually requires years, the protection duration of COVID-19 shots is a lingering question for scientists and regulators.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/thai-landfill-turned-into-urban-farm-to-feed-poor-during-pandemic/,Thai landfill turned into urban farm to feed poor during pandemic,"An urban farm developed on a former landfill site in northern Thailand boosted the food security and livelihoods of poor families during the coronavirus pandemic, and can be a model for unused spaces in other cities, urban experts said on Thursday, January 7.
The farm in Chiang Mai, about 700 kilometers (435 miles) from the capital Bangkok, took shape during a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus last year, when many of the city’s residents lost their tourism-dependent jobs.
Supawut Boonmahathanakorn, a community architect who works on housing solutions for Chiang Mai’s homeless and informal settlers, approached authorities with a plan to convert the unused landfill into an urban farm to support the poor.
“We had previously mapped the city’s unused spaces with an idea to plant trees to mitigate air pollution. The landfill, which had been used for 20 years, was one of those spaces,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“Poor families spend more than half their earnings on food, so when their incomes dried up, they were struggling to feed their families. This farm has been a lifeline for some of them,” he said, pointing to neat rows of corn and morning glory.
Coronavirus lockdowns worldwide have pushed more city dwellers to grow fruit and vegetables in the backyards and terraces of their homes, and forced authorities to consider urban farming as a means to boost food security.
In Chiang Mai, after authorities approved the farm plan, an appeal on social media resulted in donations of plants, seedlings and manure from residents, Supawut said.
With diggers loaned by the city, Supawut and his team cleared some 5,700 tons of rubbish on the 4,800 square-meter (0.48 hectare) plot that lies next to a canal and a cemetery.
The land was levelled, and a rich topsoil added to offset the degraded soil. The farm opened to the community in June.
About half a dozen homeless families, students from a public school and members of the public grow eggplant, corn, bananas, cassava, chilli, tomatoes, kale and herbs, Supawut said.
“In cities, we have lost our connection with food production, but it is a vital skill,” he said.
“Urban farms cannot feed an entire city, but they can improve nutrition and build greater self-sufficiency especially among vulnerable people. They are important during a pandemic – and even otherwise,” he added.
Urban agriculture can potentially produce as much as 180 million tons of food a year – or about 10% of the global output of pulses and vegetables, according to a 2018 study led by Arizona State University.
Rooftop farms, vertical gardens and allotments also help increase vegetation cover, which is key to limiting rising temperatures and lowering the risk of flooding in cities.
While land in cities is scarce and expensive, rooftops and spaces below expressways and viaducts can be repurposed, said landscape architect Kotchakorn Voraakhom, who designed Asia’s largest urban rooftop farm in Bangkok.
“We need imagination and greater flexibility in our laws to turn such spaces into urban farms,” she said.
“The Chiang Mai farm is a sandbox – it shows it can be done in even the most unlikely of spaces if the government and the community come together,” she added.
For Ammi, a homeless indigenous Akha woman who has lived at the farm since July, the corn, melons and cabbage that she grows have fed her and her husband, and provided a small income.
“It gives people like me an opportunity to be self-sufficient,” she said. “We need more such farms in the city.”",Reuters,"Jan 7, 2021 4:05 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-recommends-two-doses-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-within-21-28-days/,WHO recommends two doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine within 21-28 days,"People should get two doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine within 21-28 days, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday, January 5, as many countries struggled to administer the jabs that can ward off the COVID-19 virus.
Many are experiencing intensifying pressure on their health services due to surging coronavirus cases and the emergence of new variants that appear to spread more easily.
Governments are introducing new lockdown measures to halt the spread while facing massive demand for vaccines which are seen as the best way out of the global health crisis.
But with jabs in limited supply as production ramps up, the WHO has been examining how they can be used most effectively.
“We deliberated and came out with the following recommendation: two doses of this (Pfizer) vaccine within 21-28 days,” Alejandro Cravioto, chairman of WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), told an online news briefing.
The panel said countries should have leeway to spread out shots over 6 weeks so that more people at higher risk of illness can get them.
“SAGE made a provision for countries in exceptional circumstances of (Pfizer) vaccine supply constraints to delay the administration of the second dose for a few weeks in order to maximize the number of individuals benefiting from a first dose,” Cravioto said.
He added: “I think we have to be a bit open to these types of decisions which countries have to make according to their own epidemiological situations.”
More than 85 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and around 1.85 million have died, according to a Reuters tally.
SAGE executive Joachim Hombach said spacing out the two Pfizer inoculations could be acceptable for countries unable to implement the main recommendation. “The JCI, the recommending body of the UK, has given more flexibility up to 12 weeks in consideration of the specific circumstances that the country is currently facing,” he said.
“We…totally acknowledge that countries may see needs to be even more flexible in terms of administration of the second dose. But it is important to note that there is very little…empirical data from the trials that underpin this type of recommendation,” he added.
Given the limited supply of vaccines at present, Cravioto said SAGE did not recommend the Pfizer jab for international travelers as a priority unless they were in a very high-risk group, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing ailments.
Kate O’Brien, a WHO immunization expert, said there was a robust discussion at SAGE about the trade-off between adhering strictly to standard dosing in clinical trials and allowing for a broader use of vaccine as first doses, thus risking delay in getting the second dose out to some people.
Alluding to delays in rolling out inoculations, she said: “Nobody expected this to be easy and we are starting to see where the road bumps are and where we need to make adjustments.”
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said he was “very disappointed” that China had not authorized entry of an international mission to examine the origins of the global coronavirus pandemic.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/uk-scientists-worry-vaccines-may-not-protect-against-south-african-coronavirus-variant/,UK scientists worry vaccines may not protect against S.African coronavirus variant,"UK scientists expressed concern on Monday, January 4, that COVID-19 vaccines being rolled out in Britain may not be able to protect against a new variant of the coronavirus that emerged in South Africa and has spread internationally.
Both Britain and South Africa have detected new, more transmissible variants of the COVID-19-causing virus in recent weeks that have driven a surge in cases. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday he was now very worried about the variant identified in South Africa.
Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said that while both variants had some new features in common, the one found in South Africa “has a number additional mutations…which are concerning.”
He said these included more extensive alterations to a key part of the virus known as the spike protein – which the virus uses to infect human cells – and “may make the virus less susceptible to the immune response triggered by the vaccines.”
Lawrence Young, a virologist and professor of molecular oncology at Warwick University, also noted that the South African variant has “multiple spike mutations.”
“The accumulation of more spike mutations in the South African variant are more of a concern and could lead to some escape from immune protection,” he said.
Scientists including BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin and John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford, have said they are testing the vaccines against the new variants and say they could make any required tweaks in around 6 weeks.
Public Health England said there was currently no evidence to suggest COVID-19 vaccines would not protect against the mutated virus variants. Britain’s health ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The world’s richest countries have started vaccinating their populations to safeguard against a disease that has killed 1.8 million people and crushed the global economy.
There are currently 60 vaccine candidates in trials, including those already being rolled out from AstraZeneca and Oxford, Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, Russia’s Sputnik V, and China’s Sinopharm.
Scientists say both the South African and UK variants are associated with a higher viral load, meaning a greater concentration of virus particles in patients’ bodies, possibly contributing to increased transmission.
Oxford’s Bell, who advises the UK government’s vaccine task force, said on Sunday he thought vaccines would work on the British variant but said there was a “big question mark” as to whether they would work on the South African variant.
BioNTech’s Sahin told Germany’ Spiegel in an interview published on Friday that their vaccine, which uses messenger RNA to instruct the human immune system to fight the virus, should be able to protect against the UK variant.
“We are testing whether our vaccine can also neutralize this variant and will soon know more,” he said.",Reuters,"Jan 5, 2021 9:45 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/why-it-matters-coronavirus-changing-vaccine-effectiveness/,Why it matters that the coronavirus is changing – and what this means for vaccine effectiveness,"A new variant of SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly in the United Kingdom, with over 1,400 cases since September. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, generally accumulates mutations slowly over time, but this new variant had accumulated many mutations quickly.
If this new version of the virus is here to stay, as it appears to be, what does that mean? Will this new version of the virus replace the old one? Will it be easier to catch? And, most important, will the current vaccines still be effective?
This interests me because I am an evolutionary microbiologist who studies the link between the transmission and evolution of infectious diseases. In particular, I spend a lot of time considering the effects of vaccines on pathogen evolution and the effects of pathogen evolution on the impact of vaccines.
The new version of SARS-CoV-2 – named the B117 lineage – is spreading in the UK and possibly beyond. The differences between the old and new virus include 23 mutations in the virus’s genetic code that have altered 4 viral proteins.
Eight of these 23 mutations affect the spike protein. This matters because the spike protein enables the virus to enter human cells, and it is a key target of our immune response, both in fighting off the virus during infection and in protecting us from disease following vaccination with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
If the changes to the spike protein help the virus enter human cells more easily, then the virus could be transmitted from person to person more readily.
These mutations may also alter how well the host’s immune system combats the virus, potentially reducing the efficacy of the current vaccines.
Samples of the new virus isolated from patients suggest that this variant has been increasing in relative frequency over the past 3 months.
The increase in frequency is concerning, as it suggests – but does not prove – that the B117 isolates of SARS-CoV-2 are more transmissible than the original virus. Some have estimated that the new virus may be up to 70% more transmissible than the old virus. While these estimates are consistent with the data, it is entirely too early to make a definitive conclusion.
If this increase in transmissibility is confirmed, it might be due to of the mutations in the spike protein allows it to bind more tightly to the ACE2 receptor, which provides a gateway for the virus to enter human cells.
But it might also be due to any of the other changes to the virus.
If the new version, B117, is indeed more transmissible than the old virus, it will be more dangerous in the sense that it will make more people sick.
However, I am not aware of good evidence that there is any difference in severity of disease caused by the new version of this virus compared with the older one. That said, with so few known cases, it may still be too early to say.
Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines work by training our immune systems to recognize a specific version of the viral spike protein. The version of the spike protein used by the vaccines was designed to match that of the old virus, not that of the B117 virus. This means that the vaccines might become less effective than expected should this new virus spread widely.
Vaccine-virus mismatch is an ongoing challenge for scientists charged with developing the seasonal flu vaccine. But even with a virus-vaccine mismatch, the flu vaccine reduces the likelihood, and the severity, of disease.
The question is therefore not whether the vaccines will be effective, but rather how effective they will be. The severity of the mismatch matters, but the only way to determine its impact in this case is through scientific study, and to my knowledge, no data on that has yet been collected. In other words, it’s too early to say whether and how this new variant will influence the overall effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
The appearance of this new B117 makes it even more important that people get vaccinated as soon as possible.
If this new version is more transmissible, or if the vaccine is less effective because of a virus-vaccine mismatch, more people will need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity and get this disease under control.
Moreover, we now have proof that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can change drastically in a short time, and so it is critical that we get the virus under control to prevent it from evolving further and completely undermining vaccination efforts. – TheConversation/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/explainer-where-are-we-covid-19-vaccine-race/,EXPLAINER: Where are we in the COVID-19 vaccine race?,"India on Friday, January 1, became the fourth country to approve a coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, authorizing the vaccine’s rollout in coming weeks in the country with the second-highest number of infections.
The following is what we know about the race to deliver vaccines to help end the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 1.8 million people worldwide:
US drugmaker Pfizer and German partner BioNTech have been the COVID-19 vaccine trailblazers.
On November 18, they became the first in the world to release full late-stage trial data. Britain was the first to approve the shot for emergency use on December 3, followed by Canada on December 9 and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 11. Several other countries, including Saudi Arabia and Mexico, have also approved it.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the shot on December 21 and India is accelerating its review.
The World Health Organization on Thursday listed the vaccine for emergency use, in a move seeking to speed access to it in the developing world.
Moderna Inc was a close second to Pfizer in many countries after it released a full data analysis for a late-stage trial on Nov. 30 showing a 94.1% efficacy rate for its vaccine.
The United States authorized Moderna’s vaccine on December 19, while Canada approved the shot on Dec. 23 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) will do so on January 6.
India’s approval of a two-dose version of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, COVISHIELD, which has also been given the green light by Britain, Argentina, and El Salvador, is a major win for a shot seen as crucial for mass immunizations.
Questions about the robustness of its trial data have complicated the approval process.
The British company announced interim late-stage trial data in November showing two full doses were 62% effective while a half-dose followed by a full dose had a 90% success rate – but UK regulators the more successful outcome had not stood up to analysis.
AstraZeneca is also in discussions with the European Union’s European Medicines Agency, which is conducting a rolling review of the vaccine.
US drugmaker Johnson & Johnson plans to deliver trial data in January, teeing it up for US authorization in February if its shot is effective. It reduced the enrolment target for its clinical trial to 40,000 volunteers from 60,000 on December 9, potentially speeding results that are tied to how quickly participants become infected.
US firm Novavax is running a late-stage trial in Britain with data due in the first quarter of 2021. It expects to start a large-scale trial in the United States this month.
France’s Sanofi and Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline, however, announced a setback on December 11 in their attempts to develop a vaccine. The drugmakers said that it showed an insufficient immune response in older people in mid-stage trials and that they would start a new study in February.
The companies usually test their vaccines against a placebo – typically saline solution – in healthy volunteers to see whether the rate of COVID-19 infection among those who got the vaccine is significantly lower than in those who received the dummy shot.
The trials rely on subjects becoming naturally infected with COVID-19, so how long it takes to generate results largely depends on how pervasive the virus is where trials are being conducted. Each drugmaker has targeted a specific number of infections to trigger a first analysis of their data.
The World Health Organization ideally wants to see at least 70% efficacy. The FDA wants at least 50% – which means there must be at least twice as many infections among volunteers who received a placebo as among those in the vaccine group. The EMA has said it may accept a lower efficacy level.
Although Pfizer’s shot was the first to be rolled out following the publication of full phase 3 trial data, Russia and China have been inoculating their citizens for months with several different vaccines still undergoing late-stage trials.
China on December 31, approved its first COVID-19 vaccine for general public use, a shot developed by an affiliate of state-backed pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm. The company said it is 79% effective against the virus.
Russia said on November 24 its Sputnik V vaccine, developed by the Gamaleya Institute, was 91.4% effective based on interim late-stage trial results. It started vaccinations in August and has inoculated more than 100,000 people so far.
China launched an emergency use program in July aimed at essential workers and others at high risk of infection. It has vaccinated about one million people as of mid-November using at least 3 shots – one developed by the state-backed China National Biotec Group (CNBG) and one by Sinovac Biotech.
Trial data on a COVID-19 vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech has varied: interim data from a late-stage trial in Turkey showed its CoronaVac shot is 91.25% effective, while researchers in Brazil say the shot was more than 50% effective.
The United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, said on December 9 that one of the CNBG vaccines was 86% effective based on interim results from a late-stage trial in the Gulf Arab state.",Reuters,"Jan 3, 2021 3:53 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/memories-2020-why-its-important-remember-our-covid-holidays-good-bad/,"Ah, memories of 2020: Why it’s important to remember our COVID holidays, good or bad","In Charles Dickens’ famous 1843 ghost story, A Christmas Carol, Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come.
However, we do not need supernatural powers or a ghostly escort to travel in time to holidays past, present and future, at least not in our minds.
The ability to remember our past and imagine our future relies on the uniquely human gifts psychologists call retrospective and prospective memory.
What memories are we thinking of as we head towards a holiday season unlike any we’ve had before? What memories will we think back on when our break is over? Will we recall our COVID Christmas fondly or will we hope to put 2020 behind us?
Memory serves many important psychological and social functions. It helps us navigate everyday situations, such as remembering gifts we need to buy or where we’ve parked our car in a crowded shopping centre. It helps define who we are as people, our values, rituals and beliefs. It allows us to learn from the past, then predict and navigate the future. Finally, it helps shape and deepen personal and social bonds with friends, families and communities.
For many people, holidays are a time when we do our favorite things–holiday rituals, family traditions, longed-for getaways–the kinds of things we’ve always done at this time of year.
We organize our life stories–our autobiographical memories–according to reliable patterns of life events or “life scripts”. But this year, we can’t do some things in the same way. We can’t travel to all the places we usually would; family and friends might not be able to visit; and important events may be postponed or restricted.
The good news is any new rituals, traditions or holiday experiences we adopt this year may be especially memorable and meaningful. That’s because we’re particularly likely to remember novel, rather than routine, events.
For instance, in 10 years’ time, we may be more likely to remember the holiday season when we shared embarrassing family stories via Zoom than 10 years of “normal” Christmases before or after.
Of course, these holidays will still have their challenges. We might be inclined to forget 2020 and our summer break entirely. But there is value even in memories of stressful events.
In a trial published earlier this year, Macquarie University psychologist Monique Crane and her colleagues asked people over 50 to reflect on stressful or challenging events during a busy Australian Christmas period in 2018.
In this type of reflection, known as guided self-reflection, the researchers asked study participants to recall stressful experiences and then analyze what happened and how they behaved. People in the study were also asked to consider how they would tackle a similar situation in the future.
The researchers found self-reflection led people to rate themselves more resilient (agreeing with questions like “I tend to bounce back quickly after hard times”), and feeling less stressed and more positive during the previous two weeks. This is compared to people in a control group, who talked about resilience but did not recall and reflect on their own experiences.
Remembering together strengthens personal and social connections.

In other words, stressful events during Christmas became an opportunity for positive growth when people reflected on memories of their experiences and used them as building blocks for more resilient responding in the future.
Whether good or bad events, the very act of recalling memories delivers other important benefits when we remember together. Across a series of studies, my colleagues and I show talking with family and friends about life events supports or “scaffolds” individual memories.
In a study published earlier this year, we arranged for families of mothers, fathers and their two primary school-aged children to complete a Halloween-themed obstacle course in a park.
A few weeks later we asked them to reminisce about this event in mother-child, father-child and sibling-sibling pairs. Although mothers and fathers were most successful in helping their children to remember, even our littlest participants asked questions and offered their own memories in ways that encouraged and supported their memory partner’s recall.
Remembering together is just as valuable, perhaps more so, as we age and if our memories start to fade. In a second study, we asked long-married couples — people married on average for 50 years — to recall their wedding day. We first asked husbands and wives to remember separately. A week later, we asked them to remember together. Couples recalled many new details when they remembered collaboratively compared to alone.
Remembering together strengthens personal and social connections. In a year that has challenged these connections and isolated many of us, telling stories and sharing memories with our loved ones–even of these difficult and unusual times–may support and protect both our psychological and cognitive health. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/how-to-outsmart-your-covid-19-fears-and-boost-your-mood-in-2021/,How to outsmart your COVID-19 fears and boost your mood in 2021,"After a year of toxic stress ignited by so much fear and uncertainty, now is a good time to reset, pay attention to your mental health and develop some healthy ways to manage the pressures going forward.
Brain science has led to some drug-free techniques that you can put to use right now.
I am health psychologist who developed a method that harnesses our rip-roaring emotions to rapidly switch off stress and activate positive emotions instead. This technique from emotional brain training is not perfect for everyone, but it can help many people break free of stress when they get stuck on negative thoughts.
Three key things make it hard to turn off stress-activated negative emotions:
First, our genes make us worrywarts. Our hunter-gatherer ancestors survived by assuming every rustle in the grasses was a lurking hungry lion, not harmless birds hunting for seeds. We’re essentially programmed to be hyperaware of threats, and our brains rapidly launch stress chemicals and negative emotions in response.
Second, the chemical cascade of stress hormones in the brain associated with negative emotions impairs cognitive flexibility, goal-directed behavior and self-control.
Third, our tendency to avoid dealing with negative emotions puts people in a perpetual cycle of ignoring unpleasant feelings, which amplifies stress and the risk of emotional health problems.
Traditional approaches for coping with stress were based on cognitive-behavioral therapy, which focuses on modifying patterns of thinking and behavior. It was developed before our modern understanding of stress overload.
Researchers at New York University discovered a paradox: Although cognitive methods were effective in low-stress situations, they were less effective when dealing with the high stress of modern life.
Emotional brain training works with these high-stress emotions in an effort to tame them, releasing negative emotions as the first of two steps in preventing stress overload.
The only negative emotion in the brain that supports taking action rather than avoidance and passivity is anger.
Studies have shown that the suppression of anger is associated with depression and that suppressing anger doesn’t reduce the emotion. Healthy release of anger instead has been found to reduce other stress-related health risks.
Our technique is to switch off stress overload by using a controlled burst of anger to help the brain exert better emotional control and allow emotions to flow rather than become chronic and toxic. After that first short burst, other feelings can flow, starting with sadness to grieve the loss of safety, then fear and regret, or what we would do differently next time.
You can talk yourself through the stages. To experiment with the process, use these simple phrases to express the negative feelings and release your stress: “I feel angry that …”; “I feel sad that …”; “I feel afraid that …”; and “I feel guilty that …”
After releasing negative emotions, positive emotions can naturally arise. Express these feelings using the same approach: “I feel grateful that …”; “I feel happy that …”; “I feel secure that …”; and “I feel proud that …”
Your mindset can quickly change, a phenomenon that has many potential explanations. One explanation is that in positive states, your brain’s neural circuits that store memories from when you were in the same positive state in the past can be spontaneously activated. Another is that the switch from negative to positive emotions quiets your sympathetic nervous system – which triggers the fight-or-flight response – and activates the parasympathetic system, which acts more like a brake on strong emotions.
Here’s what the whole stress relief process might look like like for me right now:
I feel angry that we’re all isolated and I can’t see my new grandson Henry.
I hate it that everything is so messed up! I HATE THAT!!!
I feel sad that I am alone right now.
I feel afraid that this will never end.
I feel guilty that I am complaining! I am lucky to be alive and have shelter and love in my life.
Then the positive:
I feel grateful that my daughter-in-law sends me photos of Henry.
I feel happy that my husband and I laughed together this morning.
I feel secure that this will eventually pass.
I feel proud that I am doing the best I can to cope.
After a daunting year, and with more challenges ahead in 2021, upgrading your approach to emotions can be a drug-free mood booster. Our COVID-19 fears need not consume us. We can outsmart the brain’s fear response and find moments that sparkle with promise. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/biontech-founders-warn-vaccine-supply-gaps/,BioNTech founders warn of vaccine supply gaps,"BioNTech is working flat out with partner Pfizer to boost production of their COVID-19 vaccine, its founders said, warning there would be gaps in supply until other vaccines were rolled out.
The German biotech startup has led the vaccine race but its shot has been slow to arrive in the European Union due to relatively slow approval from the bloc’s health regulator and the small size of the order placed by Brussels.
The delays have caused consternation in Germany, where some regions had to temporarily close vaccination centers days after the launch of an inoculation drive on Dec. 27.
“At the moment it doesn’t look good – a hole is appearing because there’s a lack of other approved vaccines and we have to fill the gap with our own vaccine,” BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told news weekly Spiegel in an interview.
A shot from Moderna is expected to be cleared by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Jan. 6.
German Health Minister Jens Spahn has urged the EMA to also quickly approve a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca that Britain cleared this week. The EU timeline for that treatment remains uncertain.
Sahin said the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, which uses messenger RNA to instruct the human immune system to fight the coronavirus, should be able to cope with a variant first detected in Britain that appears to be more contagious.
“We are testing whether our vaccine can also neutralize this variant, and will soon know more,” he said.
Asked about coping with a strong mutation, he said it would be possible to tweak the vaccine as required within six weeks – though such new treatments might require additional regulatory approvals.
Sahin founded BioNTech with his wife, Oezlem Tuereci, who is the company’s chief medical officer. Both faulted the EU’s decision to spread orders in the expectation that more vaccines would be quickly approved.
The United States ordered 600 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine in July, while the EU waited until November to place an order of half that size.
“At some point it became clear that it would not be possible to deliver so quickly,” Tuereci told Spiegel. “By then it was already too late to place follow-on orders.”
BioNTech hopes to launch a new production line in Marburg, Germany, in February that could produce 250 million doses in the first half of the year, said Sahin.
Talks are underway with contract manufacturers on boosting output and there should be greater clarity by the end of January, he added.
Sahin also said BioNTech would make its vaccine, which requires storage at around minus 70 Celsius, or minus 94 Fahrenheit, easier to handle. A next-generation vaccine that would keep at higher temperatures could be ready by late summer.",Reuters,"Jan 1, 2021 6:05 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/ways-to-reboot-your-brain-after-hard-year-of-covid-19/,"6 ways to ‘reboot your brain’ after a hard year of COVID-19, according to science","There’s no doubt that 2020 was difficult for everyone and tragic for many. But now vaccines against COVID-19 are finally being administered – giving a much needed hope of a return to normality and a happy 2021.
However, months of anxiety, grief and loneliness can easily create a spiral of negativity that is hard to break out of. That’s because chronic stress changes the brain. And sometimes when we’re low we have no interest in doing the things that could actually make us feel better.
To enjoy our lives in 2021, we need to snap out of destructive habits and get our energy levels back. In some cases, that may initially mean forcing yourself to do the things that will gradually make you feel better. If you are experiencing more severe symptoms, however, you may want to speak to a professional about therapy or medication.
Here are 6 evidenced-based ways to change our brains for the better.
Kindness, altruism, and empathy can affect the brain. One study showed that making a charitable donation activated the brain’s reward system in a similar way to actually receiving money. This also applies to helping others who have been wronged.
Volunteering can also give a sense of meaning in life, promoting happiness, health and wellbeing. Older adults who volunteer regularly also exhibit greater life satisfaction and reduced depression and anxiety. In short, making others happy is a great way to make yourself happy.
Exercise has been linked with both better physical and mental health, including improved cardiovascular health and reduced depression. In childhood, exercise is associated with better school performance, while it promotes better cognition and job performance in young adults. In older adults, exercise maintains cognitive performance and provides resilience against neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia.
What’s more, studies have shown that individuals with higher levels of fitness have increased brain volume, which is associated with better cognitive performance in older adults. People who exercise also live longer. One of the very best things that you can do to reboot your brain is in fact to go out and get some fresh air during a brisk walk, run or cycling session. Do make sure to pick something you actually enjoy to ensure you keep doing it though.
Nutrition can substantially influence the development and health of brain structure and function. It provides the proper building blocks for the brain to create and maintain connections, which is critical for improved cognition and academic performance. Previous evidence has shown that long-term lack of nutrients can lead to structural and functional damage to the brain, while a good quality diet is related to larger brain volume.
One study of 20,000 participants from the UK-Biobank showed that a higher intake of cereal was associated with the long-term beneficial effects of increased volume of grey matter (a key component of the central nervous system), which is linked to improved cognition. However, diets rich in sugar, saturated fats or calories can damage neural function. They can also reduce the brain’s ability to make new neural connections, which negatively affects cognition.
Therefore, whatever your age, remember to eat a well-balanced diet, including fruits, vegetables and cereal.
Loneliness and social isolation is prevalent across all ages, genders and cultures – further elevated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Robust scientific evidence has indicated that social isolation is detrimental to physical, cognitive and mental health.
One recent study showed that there were negative effects of COVID-19 isolation on emotional cognition, but that this effect was smaller in those that stayed connected with others during lockdown. Developing social connections and alleviating loneliness is also associated with decreased risk of mortality as well as a range of illnesses.
Therefore, loneliness and social isolation are increasingly recognized as critical public health issues, which require effective interventions. And social interaction is associated with positive feelings and increased activation in the brain’s reward system.
In 2021, be sure to keep up with family and friends, but also expand your horizons and make some new connections.
The brain changes during critical periods of development, but is also a lifelong process. Novel experiences, such as learning new skills, can modify both brain function and the underlying brain structure. For example juggling has been shown to increase white matter (tissue composed of nerve fibers) structures in the brain associated with visuo-motor performance.
Similarly, musicians have been shown to have increased grey matter in the parts of the brain that process auditory information. Learning a new language can also change the structure of the human brain.
A large review of the literature suggested that mentally stimulating leisure activities increase brain-reserve, which can instil resilience and be protective of cognitive decline in older adults – be it chess or cognitive games.
Sleep is an essential component of human life, yet many people do not understand the relationship between good brain health and the process of sleeping. During sleep, the brain reorganizes and recharges itself and removes toxic waste byproducts, which helps to maintain normal brain functioning.
Sleep is very important for transforming experiences into our long-term memory, maintaining cognitive and emotional function and reducing mental fatigue. Studies of sleep deprivation have demonstrated deficits in memory and attention as well as changes in the reward system, which often disrupts emotional functioning. Sleep also exerts a strong regulatory influence on the immune system. If you have the optimal quantity and quality of sleep, you will find that you have more energy, better wellbeing and are able to develop your creativity and thinking.
So have a Happy New Year! And let’s make the most of ourselves in 2021 and help others to do the same. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/a-year-of-blursdays-how-coronavirus-distorted-our-sense-of-time-in-2020/,A year of blursdays: How coronavirus distorted our sense of time in 2020,"Does it feel like 2020 went on forever? Did lockdown drag, and can you even remember how you spent your time when you weren’t living under coronavirus restrictions? You are not alone. For many, 2020 has been the year in which the constancy of time was lost to the upheaval of coronavirus.
Objectively, time passes at a constant, linear rate. Subjectively, however, time waxes and wanes with our activities and emotions. Sometimes, it flies by, other times it drags so slowly that it almost stands still.
This is backed up by research I conducted in April, which explored how the early months of the coronavirus pandemic had affected people’s experiences of the passage of time. Of particular interest was how quickly time felt like it was passing during lockdown in comparison to “normal” (that long-ago time before lockdown).
I surveyed 604 people about how quickly time felt it was passing that day and that week in comparison to before the lockdown. Participants also answered questions about their mood, family life and how busy they were to give context on the factors, which made time more likely to speed up or slow down for different people.
My results showed that there was widespread distortion time during lockdown, with more than 80% of people reporting that time felt like it was passing differently. But lockdown did not distort time in the same way for everyone. Instead, time sped up during lockdown for 40% of people and slowed down for the remaining 40%.
Why was this? My analysis suggests that the perceived speed of time during the day was affected by a person’s age, how satisfied they were with their level of social interaction, how stressed they were and how busy they were. In general, the days passed more quickly for younger people who were socially satisfied, busy and experiencing low levels of stress. Conversely, the day passed more slowly for older people, particularly those over the age of 60, who were socially dissatisfied, stressed and lacking tasks to occupy them.
Similar patterns were observed for the subjective speed of the week. A fast week was associated with being younger and more socially satisfied, whereas a slow week was associated with being older and less socially satisfied.
A second unpublished study I conducted during the November lockdown revealed that, of the 851 people surveyed, more than 75% experienced distortion to time and 55% reported that the start of the first lockdown felt longer than eight months ago. A slower second lockdown was associated with shielding, dissatisfaction with social interaction and greater depression and boredom.
The UK is not alone in its loss of time during lockdown. Studies conducted in France, Italy and Argentina also show widespread distortion to the passage of time during periods of strict COVID-19 restrictions.
Unlike in the UK, in France and Italy lockdown passed more slowly than normal for most people rather than being split 40/40 as in my April study. As in the UK, however, boredom was an important predictor of time slowing down in Italy and in France. In France, time also passed more slowly with increasing sadness.
Why does being older, bored, stressed and socially dissatisfied make time pass more slowly? This question is difficult to answer.
Unlike other senses, we don’t have an obvious organ for time. Instead, time is experienced as part of other sensory inputs, such as sight and hearing, and this has made it difficult to identify precisely how the brain processes it.
One possibility is that when we are bored and socially dissatisfied we have lots of spare cognitive capacity and that we then use some of that capacity to increase our monitoring of time. This increased monitoring then results in time passing more slowly than normal, simply because we are more aware of time than normal. Another possibility is that the emotional consequence of lockdown altered the way the brain processes time.
In particular, the negative emotions associated with isolation, boredom, sadness and stress may have contributed to a slowing of time. However, inconsistent effects of depression and anxiety across studies suggests that the effect of emotion on time is complex.
So what of 2021? Will time regain its regular rhythm? It is difficult to say. With the first vaccines currently being deployed, we maybe more hopeful than ever that normality is just around the corner. The reality may be that normality is many months away.
Regardless, while we can’t change the actual time it takes for the vaccination program to be completed, there are some things which we can do to speed up the wait. By keeping busy, minimising stress, engaging in as much face-to-face or online social interaction as we can and by reducing our stress levels, we can help the journey back to normality pass more quickly than normal. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/astrazeneca-oxford-low-cost-covid-vaccine-approved-use-britain/,AstraZeneca/Oxford low-cost COVID vaccine approved for use in UK,"Britain on Wednesday, December 30, became the first country in the world to approve AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s low-cost COVID-19 vaccine, raising hopes it will help tackle rising cases and ease pressure on creaking health services.
The independent Medicines and Healthcare products and Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the vaccine “met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness”, and a roll-out was set for January 4.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent several days in intensive care with COVID earlier this year, called it “truly fantastic news” and “a triumph for British science”.
“We will now move to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible,” he tweeted.
Britain has already approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for general use, and some 800,000 people have received a first dose in the country’s biggest ever vaccination drive.
But as daily COVID infection rates hit record highs, the government is pinning its hopes on the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, which is cheaper to produce, and easier to store and transport.
Unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, it does not require ultra-low freezing temperatures and can use normal refrigerated supply chains, making it a more attractive proposition globally.
The partners, who have billed it as a “vaccine for the world”, have also promised to provide it not-for-profit to developing nations, and hope to make up to 3 billion doses in 2021.
Britain is struggling with another surge in the virus, with a record 53,135 daily cases reported on Tuesday, heaping fresh pressure on health services during their busiest winter months.
More than 71,000 people testing positive for the disease have now died– one of the worst tolls in the world.
But doctors say many frontline healthcare workers have been struck down with a new, potentially more contagious variant of the virus, which is thought to be behind the surge.
More than 24 million people, or 43% of England alone, are already living under strict stay-at-home measures, with bars, restaurants, pubs and other entertainment closed.
The government is under pressure to follow other European countries and introduce even tougher restrictions, including delaying the return to school next week.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to update parliament on Wednesday about whether to tighten the screw further.
But he said approval of the new vaccine was a “way out of the pandemic”.
“Now we need to hold our nerve while we get through this together,” he added.
Britain has ordered 100 million doses and the Department of Health expects 4 million doses to be ready by the end of the year, and 40 million by the end of March.
AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot called the approval “an important day for millions of people in the UK”.
“It’s exactly what we need right now,” Andrew Hayward, professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at University College London, told BBC television.
A “step change” in transmissibility has created “a race between us and the virus, and we need to slow the virus down as much as we can whilst we get as many people vaccinated as possible”, he added.
The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) in chimpanzees which has been genetically changed to stop COVID-19 replicating in humans.
It delivers genetic cargo into cells, giving them instructions how to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The vaccine costs about £2.50 ($3.40, 2.75 euros) per dose– a fraction of the price of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech drugs– which Hancock said provided hope for the rest of the world.
“This vaccine will be made available to some of the poorest regions of the world at a low cost, helping protect countless people from this awful disease,” he added.
On Sunday, Soriot said the vaccine provides “100 percent protection” against severe COVID disease requiring hospitalization.
He predicted trials would show his firm had achieved a vaccine efficacy equal to Pfizer/BioNTech at 95% and Moderna at 94.5%.
Earlier trials had shown varying outcomes in the AstraZeneca shot’s efficacy.
Initial large-scale trials in which volunteers in the UK and Brazil were given two full doses showed 62% effectiveness.
For volunteers who received a half-dose first and then a full dose one month later, however, the vaccine was found to have 90% efficacy.
The values were averaged to give the 70% figure reported by the developers in an interim study.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 30, 2020 7:02 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/masks-block-large-coronavirus-linked-droplets-study/,Masks block 99.9% of large COVID-linked droplets – study,"Face masks reduce the risk of spreading large Covid-linked droplets when speaking or coughing by up to 99.9 percent, according to a lab experiment with mechanical mannequins and human subjects, researchers said Wednesday, December 23.
A woman standing two meters (yards) from a coughing man without a mask will be exposed to 10,000 times more such droplets than if he were wearing one, even if he is only 50 centers away, they reported in the journal Royal Society Open Science.
“There is no more doubt whatsoever that face masks can dramatically reduce the dispersion of potentially virus-laden droplets,” senior author Ignazio Maria Viola, an expert in applied fluid dynamics at the University of Edinburgh’s School of Engineering, told Agence France-Presse.
Large respiratory droplets – which act like projectiles before being pulled toward the ground by gravity – are thought to be the main driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, he noted.
Smaller ones, sometimes called aerosol droplets, can remain suspended in the air for longer periods.
“We continuously exhale a whole range of droplets, from micro-scale to millimetre-scale,” Maria Viola said by phone.
“Some of the droplets will drop faster than others” depending on temperature, humidity and especially air speed, he said.
The study focused on particles larger than 170 microns in diameter – roughly two to 4 times the width of a human hair.
Aerosol particles, which tend to follow currents in the air, are generally described as smaller than 20 or 30 microns.
Intermediate size droplets can behave either way, the study found.
“If you wear a mask, you are mitigating the virus transmission by an order of magnitude – 10 times less,” Maria Viola said.
“In our study, for the larger droplets we measure, we’re talking about 99.9 percent less.”
According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle, Washington, 55,000 lives could be saved in the United States over the next four months if a policy of universal mask use were adopted.
The Institute’s modellers – who accurately predicted in mid-July that Covid-19 deaths in the US would top 224,000 by November 1 – project 561,000 deaths on current trends by April 1, 2021.
Universal mask-wearing would reduce the global death toll by 400,000 over the same period, from 2.9 million to 2.5 million, they calculate. To date, the virus has claimed about 1.7 million lives.
Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated its Covid-19 guidance on masks to recommend they be worn indoors in the presence of other people if ventilation is inadequate.
The guidelines apply especially in areas of known or suspected community transmission.
Masks serve primarily to reduce the emissions of virus-laden droplets by people when they cough, sneeze, sing, talk or simply breathe, but they can also help prevent the inhalation of droplets by the person wearing them.
“Cloth masks not only effectively block most large droplets – 20-30 microns and larger – but they can also block the exhalation of fine droplets and particles, also often referred to as aerosols,” according to the CDC.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 23, 2020 9:54 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/poorer-nations-get-covid-19-vaccine-early-2021-who/,Poorer nations to get virus vaccine early next year – WHO,"Poorer countries will begin to receive coronavirus vaccination doses early next year from a facility created to ensure fair access, the World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners said Friday, December 19.
Almost two billion doses of candidate vaccines have been secured for the Covax facility, run by the WHO along with the Gavi vaccine alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).
Countries including the United States and Britain have already begun to roll out a vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, with another developed by Moderna expected to gain widespread approval soon.
Neither drug is included in the two billion doses, but the WHO said it was in discussions with both companies.
“The arrangements announced today will enable all participating economies to have access to doses in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021,” the WHO, Gavi, and CEPI said in a statement.
Shipments of enough vaccines to protect health and social care workers would be delivered “in the first half of 2021 to all participating economies who have requested doses in this timeframe,” the statement said.
It said deliveries were contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries’ readiness for delivery.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual press conference that “light at the end of the tunnel has grown a little bit brighter.”
“But we will only truly end the pandemic if we end it everywhere at the same time, which means it’s essential to vaccinate some people in all countries, rather than all people in some countries,” he said.
The statement said that by the end of the year, 20% of the populations in participating countries should be covered.
The WHO revealed Friday that it had signed an agreement with US pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson for 500 million doses of a candidate drug, adding to agreements already signed with AstraZeneca, Novavax and Sanofi-GSK.
The UN health agency has previously said it was willing to include vaccines developed in China and Russia should those drugs prove safe and effective.
CEPI chief Richard Hatchett said massive research and development efforts were paying off.
“We now have safe and effective vaccines that can protect against Covid-19 and a clear pathway to securing two billion doses for the populations at greatest risk all around the world,” he said.
Gavi chief Seth Berkley meanwhile hailed the “unprecedented speed and scale” of the project.
“Securing access to doses of a new vaccine for both higher-income and lower-income countries, at roughly the same time and during a pandemic, is a feat the world has never achieved before,” he said.
Covax is a collaboration between organizations, companies and 190 countries – but neither the United States nor Russia have joined so far.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 19, 2020 10:24 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/coronavirus-nearly-3-times-more-deadly-than-flu/,Coronavirus nearly 3 times more deadly than flu – study,"Roughly a year into the pandemic it is clear the new coronavirus is worse than seasonal flu, and a study released on Friday, December 18, outlined just how much worse, showing a death rate almost 3 times higher among COVID-19 patients.
The research, using French national data and published in the journal The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, underscored the increased severity of illness for people with COVID-19.
Researchers compared data for 89,530 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in March and April this year with 45,819 patients hospitalized with seasonal influenza between December 2018 and the end of February 2019.
Some 16.9% of COVID-19 patients died during the period of study – which was during a devastating first wave across Europe when doctors had few therapies to turn to for severely ill people.
This compares to a death rate of 5.8% among those with influenza.
Catherine Quantin, a professor at the University Hospital of Dijon and the French national health institute INSERM who jointly led the study, said the difference in death rates was “particularly striking” given the 2018/19 flu season was the deadliest France had seen in five years.
The authors note that the difference in the number of hospitalizations – which saw twice as many people admitted for COVID-19 than flu – may be partly explained by existing immunity to influenza, either because of previous infection or vaccination.
Researchers found that more patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care – 16.3% compared with 10.8% for influenza – while the average stay in ICU was nearly twice as long (15 days compared to 8 days).
The study also reported far fewer children under 18 hospitalized with COVID-19 than with flu – 1.4% compared to 19.5%.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 18, 2020 11:49 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/us-panel-recommends-emergency-approval-moderna-covid-19-vaccine/,US panel recommends emergency approval of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine,"A US panel of experts on Thursday, December 17, voted to recommend emergency approval of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, paving the way for 6 million doses to start shipping as soon as this weekend.
The Food and Drug Administration is now expected to imminently grant an emergency use authorization (EUA), which would make Moderna’s vaccine the second to be approved in a Western country.
The panel voted 20 in favor, none against, with one abstention.
They had been asked to answer the question: “Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 18 years of age and older?”
Epidemiologist Arnold Monto, who chaired the live-streamed discussion, said nothing should be read into the fact that the vote was even more overwhelming than last week’s in favor of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
“Academics have a way of getting involved in details, and what we have done for the last 8 or 9 hours was to go over the details,” he said.
The meeting came as the number of deaths from the coronavirus quickly approaches 310,000 in the worst-hit country in the world, which this week began vaccinating health care workers and long-term care residents with the Pfizer vaccine.
Both of these frontrunners are based on cutting-edge mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) technology, which had never been approved prior to the pandemic, and both are two-dose regimens.
Though the level of protection against COVID-19 for both is around 95% – far greater than experts had thought was possible – there have now been a handful of people around the world who developed significant allergic reactions after receiving the Pfizer vaccine.
The US, which has recorded more than 17 million cases of the virus, will probably become the first country to approve the Moderna vaccine.
The small Massachusetts-based biotech firm teamed up with scientists from the US National Institutes of Health on the product and has received more than $2.5 billion from the US government for its efforts.
A clinical trial of 30,400 people found it was 94.1% effective in preventing COVID-19 compared to a placebo, performing slightly better in younger adults compared to the elderly.
Jacqueline Miller, Moderna’s vice president of infectious diseases development, said Thursday that there was a strong suggestion the vaccine also protected most people against infection, which is important from a public health perspective as it would prevent onward transmission.
An FDA review of all available data found there were “no specific safety concerns identified.”
But on Thursday, FDA official Doran Fink said that should an EUA be granted, the agency would issue a beefed-up warning label regarding potential allergic reactions.
This comes after two health care workers in Alaska had such reactions to the Pfizer vaccine, and one of them was hospitalized. Two health workers in the UK also had allergic reactions.
Moderna was criticized by Stanford expert Steven Goodman because of its plans to offer the vaccine to participants in its trial who received the placebo, even before it would normally be available to their demographic group.
This would deprive the trial of a control group and reduce the quality of data that could be gleaned from it, plus set a bad precedent for future trials, he said.
But Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer, defended the proposal.
“None of our trial participants would be ‘jumping the line’ ahead of others, because we have clinical trial supplies that in fact would expire and go to waste,” he said, adding many participants were at high-risk, and one person on the placebo group had died from severe COVID-19.
The most common side effects associated with the drug, called mRNA-1273, were injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, and chills.
Few of these effects were classed as “severe.”
Allergic reactions occurred in 1.5 of the vaccinated population compared to 1.1% of the non-vaccinated, but none were classed as severe.
To date, there have been three reports of Bell’s palsy – a facial paralysis condition, most often temporary – in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group.
The FDA said there was insufficient information to determine that either vaccine was the cause but will continue monitoring.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 18, 2020 9:29 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/french-researchers-warn-virus-risk-from-eating-out/,French researchers warn of virus risk from eating out,"Spending time in a bar or restaurant increases the risk of catching COVID-19, French researchers said Thursday, December 17, while having guests over for dinner also plays a key role in transmission.
The latest study adds to evidence that socializing and eating out are far more dangerous than other activities such as using public transport or shopping.
It comes as Europe and the Unites States in particular are grappling with surging infection rates and the start of a holiday season normally characterized by parties and family get-togethers.
Researchers from France’s Institut Pasteur sought to find out which factors – like professions, mode of transport, places visited – differentiated participants who had contracted the virus from people who had not.
“We saw an increased risk associated with frequenting bars and restaurants,” said the lead author, Arnaud Fontanet, an epidemiologist and member of the scientific council guiding the government.
The study, called ComCor, has not been peer reviewed but has informed France’s virus response.
It was carried out in October and November, during an initial period of curfew and then even tighter restrictions that saw most establishments partially or completely closed.
Fontanet told Agence France-Presse that because bars and restaurants are not functioning as normal, it was difficult to gauge their exact role in transmission, and acknowledged that closing these businesses was a “sensitive” move.
French cafes and restaurants have remained closed even after nationwide restrictions were eased earlier this week.
ComCor researchers interviewed 3,400 people infected with COVID-19 and 1,700 others who did not have the virus.
They found that frequenting restaurants, bars or gyms was associated with an increased risk of infection, whereas using public transport and visiting shops were not.
Health authorities across the world have advised people to avoid crowded indoor spaces as scientists increasingly agree that the new coronavirus can travel in fine clouds of particles known as aerosols that can collect in poorly ventilated rooms.
A September survey by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that adults with positive coronavirus test results were about twice as likely to report having eaten at a restaurant in the previous two weeks than those with negative results.
In November, a study in the journal Nature found that restaurants, gyms and cafes account for most COVID-19 infections in the United States.
Using mobile phone data from 98 million people, researchers found about 10% of venues accounted for more than 80% of cases.
The ComCor research also tried to pinpoint different circumstances of infection, with surveys of 25,600 infected individuals using health insurance data.
It showed that “meals play a central role in these contaminations,” as people sat close to each other without masks.
“Private meetings – families, friends – are the main source of infection,” Fontanet said.
“If people have friendly dinners at their homes rather than going to a restaurant, it doesn’t make a difference.”
The researchers stressed the importance of organizing such gatherings in “the safest way possible” to protect vulnerable people over the holidays.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 17, 2020 11:14 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/lab-grown-chicken-meat-historic-debut-singapore-restaurant/,Lab-grown chicken meat to make historic debut at Singapore restaurant,"Lab-grown chicken meat will make its debut at a Singapore restaurant in a culinary first this weekend after the company behind the product announced its inaugural sale Wednesday, December 16.
US start-up Eat Just said earlier this month that its product had been approved for sale in the city-state as an ingredient in chicken nuggets after Singapore became the first country to allow meat created without slaughtering any animals to be sold.
Consumption of animals is an environmental threat as cattle produce potent greenhouse gas methane, while logging to create pastures destroys natural barriers against climate change.
On Wednesday, the company said it had made its first commercial sale of the product to 1880, a restaurant in Robertson Quay, a posh riverside entertainment center.
Eat Just chief executive Josh Tetrick said the news “moves us closer to a world where the majority of meat we eat will not require tearing down a single forest, displacing a single animal’s habitat or using a single drop of antibiotics”.
The restaurant will start serving it from Saturday, December 19, the company said.
Three cultured chicken dishes will be served, “each bite influenced by a top chicken-producing country in the world: China, Brazil and the United States,” the statement added.
“This is a very exciting collaboration for me,” said Colin Buchan, the restaurant’s executive chef who used to cook for footballer David Beckham.
“I think people are going to love it.”
Demand for sustainable meat alternatives is rising due to growing pressure from consumers about the environment and animal welfare, but other products in the market are plant-based.
Meat consumption is projected to increase more than 70% by 2050, and lab-grown alternatives have a role to play in ensuring a secure food supply, the company said.
There were concerns that lab-grown varieties would be too expensive, but a spokesman for Eat Just said the company had made “considerable progress” in lowering the cost.
Singapore, the high-tech city-state, has become a hub for the development of sustainable foods, with start-ups producing goods ranging from lab-grown “seafood” to dumplings made with tropical fruit instead of pork.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 16, 2020 4:42 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/us-releases-new-data-moderna-vaccine-paving-way-approval/,"US releases new data on Moderna vaccine, paving way for approval","The US regulator on Tuesday, December 15, released new data confirming Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine was safe and effective, a strong sign that it could receive emergency approval in days and be ready to roll out by next week.
The Food and Drug Administration said there were “no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA (emergency use authorization)” and confirmed an overall efficacy of 94.1%.
Distribution of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine began on Monday and if the FDA green lights Moderna’s, rollout of some 6 million doses could start next Monday.
That would represent a powerful second weapon in the country with the world’s biggest outbreak of the virus, where more than 300,000 people have died and a winter surge is raging.
Also Tuesday, the FDA announced it had approved the first at-home rapid COVID-19 test, which will be available without prescription and return results in about 20 minutes.
But supply of the test, made by California-based Ellume, will initially be limited, with just 3 million units expected in January.
The FDA document on the Moderna vaccine offered the clearest look yet into the two-dose regimen, co-developed with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Moderna began working on the vaccine in January and has received $2.5 billion in federal funds.
On Thursday, an independent group of scientists will convene to debate everything known so far about the product.
The panel is expected to vote in favor of an EUA, and the FDA normally heeds its recommendations.
According to the new data, the shots protected younger people slightly better than older people.
In a clinical trial of 30,400 people, 196 fell ill with COVID-19 by November 21 – 11 in the vaccine group and 185 in the placebo group.
Efficacy was 95.6%for people aged 18-65; 86.4% among those aged 65 and older; and 94.1% overall.
Importantly, of 30 cases of severe COVID-19, all occurred in the placebo group.
The FDA also looked at detailed safety data at a median of 9 weeks after participants received the second shot, 28 days after the first.
The most common side effects associated with the drug, called mRNA-1273, were injection site pain in roughly 90% of cases; fatigue in 70%, headache in 60%, muscle pain in 60%, joint pain in 45%, and chills in 45%.
Few of these effects were classed as “severe” and, when they were, that tended to occur more in the young than in the old.
Lymphadenopathy, or swollen lymph nodes, occurred in 1.1% of the vaccine group against 0.6% of the placebo group.
There was an imbalance in allergic reactions, which occurred in 1.5% of the vaccinated population compared to 1.1% of the non-vaccinated.
But none were classed as severe or anaphylactic.
The frequency of life-threatening events was low, around 1% in each group, with no suggestion the vaccine was the cause.
To date, there have been three reports of Bell’s palsy – a facial paralysis condition, most often temporary – in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group.
The Pfizer trial saw 4 people get Bell’s palsy in the vaccine group, and none in the placebo group.
The FDA said there was insufficient information to determine that either vaccine was the cause.
Andrew Morris, a University of Toronto professor of medicine who has studied the condition, said “it is becoming increasingly likely that there is an important relationship with Bell’s (facial) palsy.”
However, “the absolute risk – in light of the risks associated with COVID-19 – is small,” he stressed.
Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) molecules to cause human cells to express a surface molecule of the new coronavirus.
This simulates an infection and trains the immune system to be ready in case it encounters the real virus.
The mRNA is encased inside fatty particles.
Both companies used a slightly different formulation resulting in different cold-storage requirements: -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) for Pfizer; -20 degrees Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) for Moderna.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/swathes-globe-may-not-get-vaccine-2022/,Swathes of globe may not get vaccine until 2022 – study,"At least a fifth of the world’s population may not have access to a COVID-19 vaccine until 2022, according to a study published Wednesday, December 15, with wealthier nations reserving more than half of next year’s potential doses.
With hopes that vaccines can bring an end to a pandemic that has killed some 1.6 million people, countries including the United States, Britain, and the United Arab Emirates have already begun rolling out immunization programs.
Eager to increase their chances of having access to at least one of the dozens of vaccines in development, many nations have snapped up allocations of several different drugs.
Wealthy nations – accounting for just 14% of the global population – have pre-ordered just over half of the vaccine doses expected to be produced by the 13 leading developers next year, researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found.
There are fears that poorer nations will be left behind.
Even if the drug makers all produce effective, safe vaccines and meet their maximum global manufacturing targets, the study said “at least a fifth of the world’s population would not have access to vaccines until 2022.”
The research, published in the BMJ medical journal, looked at publicly available data and found that as of mid-November, reservations totalled 7.48 billion doses – equivalent to 3.76 billion immunization courses, because most vaccines require two jabs.
That is out of a total maximum projected manufacturing capacity of 5.96 billion courses by the end of 2021.
The study estimated that up to 40% of the vaccine courses from the leading manufacturers might be available for low- and middle-income countries, but said this would depend on how rich countries share what they have bought.
The authors, who cautioned that public information was incomplete, called for “greater transparency and accountability” over support for equitable global access.
They suggested the implications could go well beyond health.
“To varying degrees, trade with and travel to countries might face continued disruption until access to effective preventive or treatment measures, such as COVID-19 vaccines, becomes more widely available,” the report said.
Many countries have joined a pooled purchasing mechanism COVAX – coordinated by the World Health Organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and vaccines alliance Gavi – aiming to ensure that people across the world have access to a COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of wealth.
The initiative is hoping to have two billion doses available by the end of 2021.
But neither the United States nor Russia have so far joined the program.
Jason Schwartz, at the Yale School of Public Health, said US participation in coordination efforts would be “invaluable” in helping ensure people across the world have access to vaccines “that will ultimately help bring an end to this devastating global health crisis.”
In a BMJ editorial, Schwartz said the requirement for two doses and the very low temperatures needed to store some of the vaccines added to the challenges for many countries.
“The operational challenges of the global COVID-19 vaccination program will be at least as difficult as the scientific challenges associated with rapidly developing safe and effective vaccines,” he said.
The Johns Hopkins authors said prices for immunizations ranged from $6 per course to as high as $74.
They found that if all the vaccines work as hoped, many richer nations would have already reserved at least one immunization per person.
Researchers said that Canada had ordered the equivalent of 4 doses per person, the United States has reserved just enough for one vaccine course per person, while countries like Indonesia have reserved less than one vaccine course for every two people.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 16, 2020 9:10 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/germany-curevac-launches-final-trials-virus-vaccine/,Germany’s CureVac launches final trials for virus vaccine,"German biotech firm CureVac announced Monday, December 14, the start of final phase clinical trials for its coronavirus vaccine before seeking approval from regulators.
The company said more than 35,000 people would take part in the tests in Europe and South America.
“The first volunteer has been recruited,” CureVac said in a statement .
Germany is battling an explosion of new coronavirus infections and is imposing a partial lockdown from Wednesday.
CureVac follows Germany’s BioNTech which has already gained approval in the United States, Britain and Canada for its vaccine developed with US pharma giant Pfizer.
Both vaccines use a new technology based on mRNA. The process entails injecting a short sequence of viral genetic material to trigger an immune response by producing proteins acting against the virus.
CureVac launched second phases trials at the end of September with 690 volunteers in Peru and Panama. Results are expected to be published soon.
But Swiss pharma company Novartis on Monday reported that phase three trials with its drug ruxolitinib had failed to show improvement when treating severe COVID-19 patients.
The drug, sold under the brand names Jakafi and Jakavi, is used to treat myelofibrosis.
The European Union has earmarked 225 million doses of CureVac’s candidate with an option for 180 million more if it wins regulatory approval.
The company listed on the New York-based Nasdaq stock exchange this year and $150 million of the funds raised is pledged to develop the vaccine.
CureVac also made headlines in March with reports that President Donald Trump had sought to secure exclusive rights for the United States to its potential  vaccine.
Both the company and US officials denied the claim, but the reports sparked outrage in Berlin and prompted Economy Minister Peter Altmaier to declare “Germany is not for sale.”

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/why-paying-people-get-coronavirus-vaccine-will-not-work/,Why paying people to get the coronavirus vaccine won’t work,"The first COVID-19 vaccine to gain emergency use authorization in the US could roll out within days, as Pfizer and BioNTech’s candidate was endorsed by an external advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration on Dec. 10. Two days earlier, an internal FDA panel endorsed the vaccine. These were the last required steps before the FDA authorizes the vaccine, which will soon be administered to healthcare workers across the country.
But while healthcare workers, who will be first to receive the vaccine, appear eager to get the shot, others are not so convinced. In fact, recent studies indicate that many Americans do not plan to get a COVID-19 vaccine, even if one is available at no cost.
If levels of vaccination are not robust, it will take longer to reach herd immunity, or widespread protection within a population. In response to these concerns, several people have suggested that the government should provide a monetary incentive to COVID-19 vaccination.
We are health law professors and, in our view, it is important to understand how these monetary incentives work as COVID-19 vaccines become available, why payment for vaccination may exacerbate vaccine mistrust, and how this incentive fits into the broader history of monetary incentives in public health.
In summer and early fall of 2020, several surveys indicated that the number of Americans planning to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was lower than desirable. Experts estimate that achieving herd immunity require anywhere from 67% to 85% of Americans to be vaccinated. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center showed that only 60% of American were considering getting a COVID-19 vaccine.
If vaccination rates are indeed low once vaccines become available on a large scale, it will take the US longer to curb the pandemic. Moreover, many Americans expressing COVID-19 vaccine mistrust are part of are members of racial minorities, which are precisely among the groups hit the hardest by the pandemic.
The idea of monetary incentives seems straightforward: Pay people to get vaccinated. One of the earliest proponents, economist Robert Litan, called the idea an “adult version of the doctor handing out candy to children.”
Litan suggested that the government should pay $1,000 to each person who receives a COVID-19 vaccine. He admitted in his proposal that he had not relied on any studies or data to get to this number, explaining that the proposed payment amount was a “hunch.”
His idea has since been endorsed by prominent commentators. These include economist Gregory Mankiw and politician John Delaney, who suggested that the incentive should be increased to $1,500.
Paying incentives to people who take on health risks to help others is not new. The most common example is clinical trials. Participants in these trials often receive set payments typically ranging from $25 to $1,000, to cover the costs of participation and perhaps to compensate for participants’ time.
Researchers don’t intend for these payments to induce subjects to take risks they would otherwise refuse. But there is a concern that, if clinical researchers pay potential subjects for risk-taking, their clinical trials will prey on poorer people for whom the payment would make the most difference. The law withholds authorization for clinical trials where there is reason to suspect that large payments were inducing people to take risks against their better judgment.
While a number of studies demonstrate that nominal payments rarely cause a person to consent to clinical research the person believes is risky, data show that payments as high as $1,000 cause potential participants to perceive the proposed research as highly risky. Those individuals seek out risk information and review it more closely than others who were offered significantly smaller payments.
Monetary compensation is also available in other cases. For instance, payments for the donation of plasma currently ranges from $30 to $60. Compensation for the donation of gametes is also possible, with $35-$125 being the range for sperm donations, and $5,000-$10,000 the range for egg donations.
There are also cases in which it’s been effective to nudge people to stop unhealthy behaviors. Studies have shown that paying people to stop smoking can be a powerful incentive. These studies offered smokers rewards that ranged from $45 to $700. People who received a reward were less likely to restart smoking, even after the monetary incentive ended.
Conversely, the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act expressly prohibits payment for organ donations. Here, the concern is that allowing payments would undermine the altruism underlying the current system such that nobody would give their organs for free if there is a market for them. And where there is a market, it will exploit the poorest among us, who are the most vulnerable.
In countries that do not prohibit payment for human organs, there is anecdotal evidence of unscrupulous brokers and healthcare providers who profit from the desperation of wealthy recipients at the expense of impoverished and vulnerable donors.
In the medical context, monetary incentives are typically not available when participants take a health risk that nonetheless provides them with some likely personal benefit. Instead, payment is more likely for people who agree to participate in clinical trials where the participants are unlikely to benefit medically from their participation. This also applies to payments for donations of plasma and gametes given that donors do not benefit medically from their participation.
A massive payment plan designed to promote COVID-19 vaccination would be very different from current monetary incentives. In addition to its novelty, our concern is that such a scheme would have unintended consequences.
First, we have no actual behavioral studies in this area – as opposed to the case of smoking cessation rewards. Similarly, as the proponents of vaccination rewards admit, there is no data on how to set the appropriate reward.
Second, the proposal might backfire. People who already do not trust vaccines may consider the mere availability of payment as confirmation that vaccination is especially risky or undesirable. And people or organizations interested in promoting disinformation about vaccines may portray payment originating from the government as “proof” of deep-state or hidden agendas associated with vaccination. If people perceive the monetary incentive in this way, that could contribute to increased vaccine hesitancy – precisely the opposite of what it is intended to do.
Third, we worry about the socioeconomic underpinnings of this proposal. An amount close to $1,000 is supposed to prompt a person to change attitudes toward vaccination. In practice, this means that richer individuals, who might not be moved by $1,000, can just ignore the reward. Poorer people, however, are expected to change their behaviors in exchange for money. This is a paternalistic approach that does not help build trust in the government and public health authorities among poorer communities.
For these reasons, we urge caution to regulators and legislators in this area. We all want the pandemic to come to an end as soon as possible. But we need to get the incentives right, which entails relying on data, and not just on unstudied theories. – TheConversation/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/what-we-know-covid-19-vaccines-side-effects/,What we know about COVID-19 vaccines and side effects,"The distribution of the first vaccines for the coronavirus has raised hopes that the end of the pandemic may be in sight, but it has also sparked some concern about side effects.
Here’s what we know so far.
Results from final-stage clinical trials of two of the frontrunner vaccines were published this week and both are considered safe.
Data for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine – already authorized in several countries – was released in the peer-reviewed scientific journal New England Journal of Medicine.
The drug is based on experimental technology that uses a synthetic version of a molecule called “messenger RNA” to hack into human cells and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.
Its trial involved 40,000 volunteers and suggested the vaccine provokes only mild side effects.
Some 80 percent of those vaccinated felt pain at the injection site. Many also felt fatigue, headache and muscle-pain and some had temporarily swollen lymph nodes.
These side effects were more frequent and intense for young people.
A partnership between Oxford University and AstraZeneca uses a disabled virus – in this case a chimpanzee adenovirus – as a vehicle to carry the vaccine.
Their vaccine data – from trials involving some 23,000 volunteers – was published in another prestigious medical journal, The Lancet. The study found the vaccine is safe.
Saying you prefer one vaccine to another is like saying you prefer chocolate ice cream to strawberry ice cream, according to virologist from the French national health-research institute (INSERM) Marie-Paule Kieny.
She told the French parliament citizens should be aware that the vaccines might “hurt the arm and induce fatigue,” comparing the side effects to those children experience when they get a jab.
“It’s unpleasant, for a day or so maybe, but these reactions are short-lived and if they are associated with a high level of protection I think it should be tolerable.”
Severe side effects for both vaccines have so far been extremely rare.
Only one patient who received the Oxford AstraZeneca jab had a “serious side effect possibly related” to the injection, according to the data in The Lancet.
The patient suffered from transverse myelitis, a rare neurological condition that causes inflammation of the the spinal cord.
This provoked the temporary global shutdown of trials in early September.
Two other serious side effects were observed, although these have not been attributed to the jab.
Researchers said all 3 had recovered.
Four cases of Bell’s palsy – a facial paralysis that is often temporary – were observed among 18,000 volunteers over two months in the Pfizer/BioNTech trial.
But the frequency is similar to that normally seen in the general population for this condition, so it is unclear whether the cases were provoked by the vaccine.
To be on the safe side, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended particular caution.
There were 8 cases of appendicitis in those who were administered the vaccine, double the amount for those who received the placebo one.
But the FDA put this down to a statistical coincidence, unrelated to the vaccine.
As for all medicine, the hypothesis of serious side effects cannot be ruled out. A substance is evaluated by weighing the benefits against the risks.
“It is completely acceptable to have a vaccine that is slightly more reactogenic, if its side effects are not severe,” said vaccine expert for the French medicine agency (ANSM) Isabelle Parent.
After Britain began administering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine earlier this week, British health authorities said two patients had suffered adverse reactions.
Both were said to have serious allergic pathogens, to the extent they always carry adrenaline on them.
In response, British authorities warned anyone with “a history of a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, medicine or food” to avoid taking the vaccine.
“For the general population this does not mean that they would need to be anxious about receiving the vaccination,” Stephen Evans, pharmacoepidemiology professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Science Media Centre (SMC).
“One has to remember that even things like marmite can cause unexpected severe allergic reactions,” he added.
Those in charge of the clinical trial anticipated the risk, excluding volunteers with a history of severe allergic reactions to vaccines in general or to one of the vaccine’s components.
Millions of people who suffer from allergies to common substances such as eggs and nuts do not appear to be allergic to the vaccine.
“It will be important to now understand the specific nature of the reactions and the background medical history of the individuals affected,” Graham Ogg, interim director Oxford’s Medical Research Council Human Immunology Unit told SMC.
As the vaccines are new, scientists do not know for certain the potential long term side effects.
Although they might be authorized for emergency use because of the pandemic, their data will be continuously monitored by world health authorities so they can react immediately.
“As is normal for any vaccine, close and continued monitoring for safety and efficacy data as it is delivered will be essential,” said Dr Charlie Webber, head of vaccines for the charity Wellcome, according to SMC.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 12, 2020 10:55 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/genetic-variants-linked-severe-covid-19-study/,Genetic variants linked to severe COVID-19 – study,"Scientists said Friday, December 11, they had identified genetic variants that made patients more likely to develop severe COVID-19, in a breakthrough that could see new and existing drugs help patients survive the illness.
To determine why some people develop severe lung inflammation when sick with COVID-19, researchers analyzed mutations on the genomes of more than 2,000 critically ill patients across Britain.
They compared their genetic make-up to that of a control group and identified as many as 8 sequences that were more common among the COVID-19 patients.
They found that these sequences are involved in the body’s inflammatory response and how the immune system battles pathogens such as the novel coronavirus.
After further computer analysis, they highlighted two specific genes – TYK2 and CCR2 – that encode inflammatory protein molecules.
The researchers found that individuals who produce more of the TYK2 enzyme appeared to be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19.
“We’re trying to cut through the tremendous complexity of the human immune system to find the levers that we can pull that will change the outcome for the patient,” said Kenneth Baillie, a geneticist at the University of Edinburgh and lead author of the study published in Nature.
“The beauty of genetics is that it can predict the effects that a drug might have. The really exciting thing about this study is that we have found genes that are directly therapeutically relevant, so they lead us directly to treatment.”
Baillie said that there is already a group of drugs on the market that limits the action of TYK2. These are known as JAK inhibitors and are often prescribed for chronic diseases such as cancer and arthritis.
“We showed that people who produce more TYK2 are more at risk of COVID. And there’s a drug that inhibits it,” he told journalists via video-link.
The authors noted that there was also an antibody treatment currently in clinical trials that blocks CCR2, a protein involved in immune response.
They said wide-scale trials were urgently needed to test these treatments on patients with severe Covid-19.
Sir Mark Caulfield, chief scientist for Genomics England and director of the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Barts Hospital, called Friday’s research “a remarkable result.”
He said the team’s study of patient genomes could eventually create a “comprehensive inventory of variants that change our susceptibility to the severity of COVID.”
“And maybe, just maybe, as a result we will find a new therapy that will help people survive this better.”",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 12, 2020 11:16 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/what-psychology-can-tell-us-about-why-people-not-wear-masks-and-how-to-change-their-minds/,What psychology can tell us about why some people don’t wear masks – and how to change their minds,"While the world is eagerly waiting for COVID-19 vaccines to bring an end to the pandemic, wearing a mask to help prevent viral transmission has become more or less mandatory globally. Though many people embrace mask wearing and adhere to public health advice, some rebel and argue that wearing a mask has been imposed upon them against their will.
With mask wearing and social distancing, it’s down to the individual to decide whether or not to comply, yet what influences compliance isn’t straightforward. Demographic factors such as income level, political affiliation and gender have all been associated with whether people choose to wear a mask and socially distance.
However, psychology can go some way to explaining why behavioral differences occur. Past research has shown that psychological factors such as an individual’s perception of risk and tendency towards risky behavior influence adherence to health behaviors. This is now being seen in the current pandemic.
One preprint study (yet to be peer reviewed) has shown that a greater propensity for risky decision-making goes hand in hand with being less likely to appropriately wear a mask or maintain social distancing. In another piece of research, perceptions of the risk of COVID-19 are cited as a driver of whether people decide to socially distance.
And there may also be a further psychological explanation: the phenomenon of “psychological reactance.. This is where people vehemently believe they have freedom to behave how they wish, and experience negative emotions when this freedom is threatened, and so become motivated to reinstate it.
This means that when told to wear a mask and socially distance, some people may perceive their behavioral freedom to be under threat. Anger and other negative emotions then follow. To reduce these uncomfortable feelings, these individuals may then attempt to restore their freedom by not complying with the advice.
The potential problem of psychological reactance has been discussed since early on in the pandemic, and is now being investigated specifically regarding masks.
Just as psychology can help explain why people may reject masks, it can also offer guidance on how to get people to accept them. A variety of techniques from social psychology can be used to persuade people to comply with health advice such as mask wearing, social distancing, and self-isolating.
One key persuasion method is portraying consensus. When you show people that an attitude is shared (or not) by others, they are more likely to adopt it. Seeing someone wearing a mask makes it more likely that others will do the same. Persuasion strategies could therefore focus on making sure that people perceive mask wearing as widespread – perhaps by depicting it frequently in the media or by making it mandatory in certain places.
We also know from previous studies that people are more likely to comply with public health guidelines if they are clear, precise, simple and consistent – and if they trust the source from which they come.
But the effectiveness of these sorts of “one-size-fits-all” approaches to persuasion and behavioral change are likely to be limited. Initial findings in the area of personalized persuasion suggest it might be more effective to try bespoke approaches for people, based on combinations of their key characteristics (their “psychographic profiles”).
For example, in a recent piece of non-COVID research we identified three main personality profiles. Those who are more shy, socially inhibited and anxious tend to report being more likely to be persuaded by those in authority, whereas those who are more self-oriented and manipulative tend to feel the opposite; they report being less likely to be influenced by authority figures.
Moreover, those in the third group – who are agreeable, extroverted and conscientious – report being more likely to be persuaded to do something if it is consistent with what they have done before, and less likely if it requires them to change their position. This means if they have decided in the past that wearing masks is a bad thing, they’re more likely to resist any subsequent efforts to make them wear one.
A recent article concluded that shouting at people to wear masks won’t help, and this research into personalized persuasion backs this up. Only those in the shy and anxious group would be likely to respond well to such a direct and heavy-handed tactic. A far better strategy would be to try an empathetic approach that seeks to understand the varying motivations of different groups of people – including whether there is psychological reactance at play – and then tailor messages to individuals accordingly. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/astrazeneca-use-part-russian-covid-19-vaccine-trials/,AstraZeneca to use part of Russian COVID-19 vaccine in trials,"Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca’s Russian branch said Friday, December 11, it would use part of Russia’s homemade Sputnik V vaccine in further clinical trials.
“Today we announce a clinical trial program to assess safety and immunogenicity of a combination of AZD1222, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, and Sputnik V, developed by Russian Gamaleya Research institute,” AstraZeneca said in a statement published on its website in English and Russian.
The pharmaceutical company said that adults over the age of 18 will be enrolled in the trials.
While the Sputnik V jab uses human adenovirus vectors, AZD1222 relies on adenovirus from chimpanzees.
Russia’s Direct Investment Fund, which funded the development of Sputnik V, said in a statement on Friday that on November 23 it offered AstraZeneca “to use one of the two vectors of the Sputnik V vaccine in additional clinical trials of its own vaccine.”
Those trials are expected to start before the end of this year.
“Combinations of different COVID-19 vaccines may be an important step in generating wider protection through a stronger immune response and better accessibility,” AstraZeneca said in its statement.
It added that cooperation with the Gamaleya Research Institute – the developer of the Sputnik V jab – is “important to explore the potential of vaccine combinations unlocking synergies in protection and accessibility through a portfolio approach.”
Russia was one of the first countries to announce the development of a coronavirus vaccine, which it named Sputnik V after the Soviet era satellite.
Last week Russia started a large-scale public vaccination drive, offering the vaccine initially to medics and other people in risk groups.
While the vaccine is yet to complete its third and final phase of trials, its developers said that interim trial results showed 95% efficacy.
The British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca had earlier said that its vaccine was on average 70% effective.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 11, 2020 9:30 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/sanofi-gsk-covid-vaccine-delayed-until-end-of-2021/,"Sanofi, GSK Covid vaccine delayed until end of 2021","France’s Sanofi and Britain’s GSK said Friday, December 11, their COVID-19 vaccines will not be ready until the end of 2021, after interim results showed a low immune response in older adults.
The announcement is a huge setback in efforts to fight the pandemic, which emerged in China last December and has killed over 1.5 million people worldwide.
Sanofi and GSK said the delay in their adjuvanted recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccine program was to “improve immune response in older adults.”
The vaccine’s potential availability had been pushed back “from mid-2021 to Q4 2021,” they said in a statement.
No single pharma company can make it alone; the world needs more than one vaccine to fight the pandemic.
Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Head of Sanofi Pasteur
American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have said their vaccine had proven 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials involving more than 40,000 people.
The vaccine candidate, developed by Sanofi in partnership with GSK, is based on technology that Sanofi has used to produce seasonal influenza vaccines and on immunological agents developed by GSK.
“Phase 1/2 study interim results showed an immune response comparable to patients who recovered from COVID-19 in adults aged 18 to 49 years, but a low immune response in older adults likely due to an insufficient concentration of the antigen,” the statement said.
It said a recent study in non-human primates “performed with an improved antigen formulation demonstrated that the vaccine candidate could protect against lung pathology and lead to rapid viral clearance from the nasal passages and lungs, within 2 to 4 days.
“These results increase the companies’ confidence in the capacity of the adjuvanted recombinant platform to deliver a highly efficient vaccine for all adults,” it said.
The hunt for a vaccine brings up questions like whether unexpected safety issues may arise when the number of people vaccinated grows to millions and possibly billions of people.
Also unknown is whether more side effects will emerge with longer follow-up, how long the vaccine remains effective, whether it will limit transmission and how it will work in children, pregnant women, and immunocompromized patients.
“We care greatly about public health which is why we are disappointed by the delay announced today, but all our decisions are and will always be driven by science and data,” said Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Head of Sanofi Pasteur.
“We have identified the path forward and remain confident and committed to bringing a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine,” he said.
Both Russia and China have already begun inoculation campaigns with domestically produced vaccines despite far less vetting as several other vaccines are being developed in the West.
“No single pharma company can make it alone; the world needs more than one vaccine to fight the pandemic,” Triomphe said.
Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines added: “The results of the study are not as we hoped. Based on previous experience and other collaborations, we are confident that GSK’s pandemic adjuvant system, when coupled with a COVID-19 antigen, can elicit a robust immune response.”
The companies plan a Phase 2b study expected to start in February. If the data is positive, a global Phase 3 study could start in the second quarter of next year.
“Positive results from this study would lead to regulatory submissions in the second half of 2021, hence delaying the vaccine’s potential availability from mid-2021 to Q4 2021,” the statement said.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 11, 2020 4:26 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/hospital-staff-truly-exhausted-says-texas-doctor-in-viral-hug-photo/,"Hospital staff ‘truly exhausted,’ says Texas doctor in viral hug photo","Through multiple masks, a face shield and a protective suit he likens to those worn by astronauts, Dr Joseph Varon bends over his COVID-19 patient and waves into the phone she is holding up.
At the other end of the video call,  several loved ones express their delight at seeing the man who helped save Gloria Garcia from the disease that has killed more than 278,000 people in the US and counting.
Varon, the chief of staff at United Memorial, a small hospital that primarily treats minority patients in a low-income north Houston neighborhood, made headlines when a photo of him hugging an elderly COVID patient on Thanksgiving went viral.
The hug was a candid moment of empathy. And Varon’s wave to Garcia’s family is enthusiastic.
But make no mistake: the doctor is exhausted.
When AFP accompanied Varon on his rounds on Friday, it was his 260th straight day of work.
Even the few hours he steals at home each day are interrupted by endless phone calls. He sleeps, he says, no more than one or two hours a night.
“Don’t ask me how I can do this,” he adds.
Donuts play a role. He displays a box, adding: “Whatever they bring is what I will eat because you don’t know when you’re going to eat again.” He says he has gained 35 pounds (15 kilograms).
Outspoken and frustrated, Varon complained to the media as far back as July that he and his staff were running “on fumes.”
“My staff is very tired. My nurses, they will start crying in the middle of the day. They will break down because they are so overwhelmed with the number of cases we’re getting that they are truly exhausted,” he tells AFP.
Inside the critical care COVID ward, the beds are full. Staff take vitals and check on patients. Varon does his daily rounds.
Garcia, ahead of her video call, sits up in bed and carefully arranges her hair and makeup. Other patients lie back on their pillows, with get well cards taped to walls.
The health workers’ faces can barely be seen through the layers of protective gear. Some, including Varon, wear large photographs of themselves around their necks. It was the loneliness and lack of human contact on the ward that drove his pity for the man he hugged in the viral photo, he said.
During the summer, as cases across Texas surged, they were backed up by a specialist army team providing medical support.
But the military soon moved on. Varon and his staff kept working.
They have some reinforcements still: since the pandemic began, traveling nurses across America have rushed towards the danger even as others have hunkered down.
Demetra Ransom is one of them. She left her home in Florida to head first to New York, epicenter of the US outbreak in the spring, and then to other hotspots before landing in Houston.
At United Memorial she is tactile with the patients, touching their arms and shoulders to comfort them. She talks even to those who are non-responsive, she says, updating them on their condition in case they can hear.
It did not have to be this way, Varon believes.
He has expressed his frustration with the American failure to control the pandemic many times.
Texas Governor George Abbott, a Republican and ally of President Donald Trump, ordered a one-month lockdown in the state in April – but did not renew it.
The wearing of masks did not become compulsory in Texas until July, as cases surged and the state become one of the new US epicenters. Abbot says there will be no more lockdowns.
“People are out there in bars, restaurants, malls,” Varon told CNN when he was interviewed about the viral photo. “It is crazy. People don’t listen and then they end up in my ICU.”
If Americans would follow basic health and social distancing guidelines, “health care workers like me could hopefully rest,” he said.
He does not appear to dwell on sleep, however. He knows there are miles to go.
The next 6 to 12 weeks, over the Christmas period and into the new year, will likely be the “darkest  weeks in modern American  medical history,” he said in a recent interview with ABC.
Already cases in Texas are so high that Abbott has requested a military medical center be converted for intake of non-Covid patients to free up space in hospitals. County officials, meanwhile, have requested additional mobile morgues.
United Memorial recently added another COVID wing in anticipation.
For now, in the main staging area which is separated from the ward’s rooms by barriers, United Memorial staffers shed some of their protective gear beneath a sign reading “COVID HUNTERS.”

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/they-got-placebo-should-be-next-in-line-vaccine/,They got the placebo – should they be next in line for vaccine?,"With America poised to become the next country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine, authorities find themselves facing an ethical dilemma: when to give trial participants who received a placebo the real deal.
The question is most pressing for studies involving Pfizer-BioNTech’s two-shot regimen, which has received emergency approval in Britain and a handful of other countries. The US could follow within days.
On Thursday, December 10, the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine published results from a clinical trial involving nearly 44,000 people in the United States and other countries.
Around half were randomly chosen to receive injections containing the companies’ patented messenger RNA molecules, while the rest got saline solutions.
The experiment was “blinded,” meaning neither the volunteers nor their healthcare providers knew who was given what, a crucial element in ensuring people go about their everyday lives as they would have otherwise done.
Independent researchers analyzing the study waited for volunteers to become infected naturally – unfortunately, owing to the rampant nature of the pandemic, this happened all too quickly – then lifted the hood on the data so that they, and only they, could see which group the sick were in.
The results confirmed that receiving the vaccine reduced the risk of developing COVID-19 by 95% compared to not receiving it, and that no serious side effects could be attributed to the drug.
So why isn’t that enough to call off the trial and make sure everyone now benefits?
Ideally scientists still want more data, which would help clarify, for example, possible long-term harms linked to the vaccine.
“If you are a vaccine developer or a scientist, you acknowledge the importance of following people out for as long as you can, to see what the differences are between the vaccine arm and the placebo arm,” Andrew Morris, a University of Toronto professor of medicine, told AFP.
But at some point, he said, “you have to call it” because “one of the aspects of people volunteering into trials is they took one for the team – you need to have some way to be able to repay them.”
Stanford professor Steven Goodman weighed in on the subject Thursday as a high-level committee convened by the Food and Drug Administration discussed the critical issue.
“An ethical dilemma is not a choice between right and wrong, that’s what we write to advice columnists for,” he said. Rather, it was weighing up competing interests.
He argued that, since trial participants are aware that the study is for the benefit of society, they have no absolute right to jump to the front of the line.
Goodman suggested that people who received the placebo be informed on the day that local and national authorities determined people in their age and risk group are eligible.
This would encourage them to stay in the trial since they would be in the “front of their own line,” and it would preserve the controlled nature of the experiment.
Pfizer, for its part, has suggested a similar plan, with the important exception that it would also allow participants to request that they be told which group they’re in even earlier, and offered the vaccine.
Another possibility, said Goodman, would be a “crossover” plan in which people who got the vaccine in the first round would then get the placebo, and vice versa, which would still yield useful data.
There are certain practical considerations.
If the FDA opts for rules that are too onerous, people might just drop out and it would damage confidence in trials moving forward.
What’s more, now that we know all about common side effects of the vaccine, people can guess which group they belonged to.
This might impact how they behave in public and their level of risk-taking behavior.
Placebo participants will receive the vaccine from trial organizers, Moncef Slaoui, chief advisor to the US government’s Operation Warp Speed said in a recent briefing. “The question more is when?”
A legal hard stop to the placebo group would occur when a vaccine receives full licensure, which is expected a few months after emergency approval.
Slaoui added that researchers would still be able to gather long-term data, just without an experimental control.
New puzzles would soon emerge, though. When one or more vaccines have been approved, it may become more difficult to motivate people to sign up for or remain in other vaccine trials.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 11, 2020 9:37 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/australian-covid-19-vaccine-dropped-false-positive-hiv-result/,Australian COVID-19 vaccine dropped over false positive HIV result,"Development of a COVID-19 vaccine in Australia was abandoned Friday, December 11, after clinical trials produced a false positive HIV result among subjects involved in early-stage testing.
The result prompted the government to axe plans to purchase millions of doses of the candidate vaccine and instead increase orders of alternatives from AstraZeneca and Novax, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.
“The University of Queensland vaccine will not be able to proceed based on the scientific advice, and that will no longer feature as part of Australia’s vaccine plan,” Morrison said.
The candidate vaccine, which was still in phase one trials at the University of Queensland, used a small amount of HIV protein as a “molecular clamp” but triggered an antibody response that could interfere with HIV screening, Health Minister Greg Hunt said.
Although the vaccine had proved promising at suppressing COVID-19 and there was no chance of HIV transmission, development was abandoned over fears it could undermine public confidence in vaccinations, Department of Health Secretary Brendan Murphy said.
“It probably would have worked very well as a vaccine, but we can’t have any issues with confidence,” Murphy said.
Professor Paul Young from the University of Queensland insisted that the HIV protein used in the vaccine was “completely harmless” and posed no health risk to those who took part in trials.
The government said the announcement did not change the planned roll-out of other vaccines to begin in March.
With Australia recording only a small number of infections daily, the government said it could afford to take a relatively cautious approach to vaccines in comparison to countries with large outbreaks.

An editorial related to the scientific paper said: “The trial results are impressive enough to hold up in any conceivable analysis. This is a triumph.”
The full trial included almost 44,000 volunteers, several thousand more than the number seen in prior analyses. Around half received the vaccine and the rest a placebo.
The paper confirmed that a two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 infection.
The vaccine worked similarly across “age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions,” the paper said.
Among 10 cases of severe COVID-19 after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and one in a person who received the vaccine.
The editorial that accompanied the study did flag certain “minor issues.”
“The number of severe cases of COVID-19 (one in the vaccine group and 9 in the placebo group) is too small to draw any conclusions about whether the rare cases that occur in vaccinated persons are actually more severe,” it said.
Other questions include whether unexpected safety issues may arise when the number of people vaccinated grows to millions and possibly billions of people.
Also unknown is whether more side effects will emerge with longer follow-up, how long the vaccine remains effective, whether it will limit transmission, and how it will work in children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised patients.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 10, 2020 11:02 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/china-vaccine-diplomacy-global-charm-offensive/,China’s ‘vaccine diplomacy’: A global charm offensive,"As wealthy countries scramble to buy up the limited supply of big-name coronavirus vaccines, China is stepping in to offer its homegrown jabs to poorer countries. But the largesse is not entirely altruistic, with Beijing hoping for a long-term diplomatic return.
The strategy carries multiple possible benefits: deflecting anger and criticism over China’s early handling of the pandemic, raising the profile of its biotech firms, and both strengthening and extending influence in Asia and beyond.
“There is no doubt China is practicing vaccine diplomacy in an effort to repair its tarnished image,” Huang Yanzhong, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), told AFP.
“It has also become a tool to increase China’s global influence and iron out… geopolitical issues.”
There is no doubt China is practicing vaccine diplomacy in an effort to repair its tarnished image.
Huang Yanzhong, a fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations
Stung by criticism of its handling of the emergence of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China has made much of its own ability to get its own outbreak under control, with state media carrying pictures of life-as-normal at pool parties and sporting events.
In the early months of the pandemic, Beijing hurried to export millions of masks and gowns, and sent medical teams to help strained healthcare systems in Europe and Africa.
Now, with major Western pharmaceutical companies beginning to bring their vaccines to market, China is rolling out its own versions — signing agreements to supply millions of doses, including to countries that have a sometimes-prickly relationship with Beijing.
Chinese diplomats have inked deals with Malaysia and the Philippines, both of which have previously complained about Beijing’s expansionist ambitions in the South China Sea.
In August, Premier Li Keqiang promised priority vaccine access to countries along the Mekong river, where a devastating drought has been worsened by Chinese dams built upstream.
“China’s ‘vaccine diplomacy’ is not unconditional,” Ardhitya Eduard Yeremia and Klaus Heinrich Raditio said in a paper published this month by the Singapore-based Yusof Ishak institute.
“Beijing may use its vaccine donations to advance its regional agenda, particularly on sensitive issues such as its claims in the South China Sea,” they added.
The move by President Xi Jinping to offer up a Chinese vaccine worldwide as a “public good” also allows Beijing to paint itself as a leader in global health, said the CFR’s Huang, seizing a mantle left untended as the US retreated under Donald Trump’s “America First” doctrine.
Washington is notably absent from a global alliance of 189 countries that have pledged to distribute vaccines equitably. Beijing signed up in October as its drugmakers launched final stage trials.
But this programme has only secured enough doses to cover 20 percent of the population of low- and middle-income countries by the end of next year – offering a commercial opportunity.
China is ramping up production facilities to make one billion coronavirus shots next year – and, having largely tamed the outbreak at home, it will have a surplus to sell.
If China can capture just 15 percent of the market in middle and low-income countries, it would net around $2.8 billion in sales, according to an estimate by Essence Securities, a Hong Kong-based brokerage firm.
“Everyone is clamouring for a vaccine and Beijing is in a good position to tap gold at the bottom of the pyramid,” said an analyst at the company, who declined to be named.
The global inoculation drive also requires storage facilities and cold chains to transport the doses.
Such projects dovetail nicely with Xi’s $1 trillion infrastructure push – the Belt and Road Initiative – which has otherwise taken a hit because of the pandemic, said Kirk Lancaster of the CFR.
E-commerce giant Alibaba has already built warehouses in Ethiopia and Dubai that will serve as vaccine distribution hubs for Africa and the Middle East.
Beijing is constructing vaccine production facilities in countries like Brazil, Morocco and Indonesia that have participated in global trials by Chinese drugmakers.
And China has promised a $1 billion loan to Latin American and Caribbean nations to fund procurement.
Chinese firms will be able to piggyback on this infrastructure further down the line.
“All these efforts, branded as the ‘Health Silk Road’, are helping China redeem its national reputation while opening up new markets for its companies,” Lancaster said.
However, there is a fly in the ointment.
China has 4 vaccines in the final stages of development, and is well advanced with mass human testing in a number of countries, including Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.
Millions more at home have already received a jab.
But unlike vaccines being developed by Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, little information has been published about the safety or efficacy of Chinese vaccines.
The country’s communist authorities – who control everything from universities to regulators – are allergic to public scrutiny.
“The lack of transparency in China’s system means that thousands (inside the country) have already received Chinese vaccines without the relevant testing data having being published,” Natasha Kassam, a China policy analyst at the Lowy Institute, said.
She said that the lack of data “will cause alarm” during a global rollout.
Chinese vaccine makers also have chequered reputations, after major scandals at home involving expired or poor quality products.
All of which means overseas buyers are cautious.
Chinese vaccine frontrunners Sinovac and Sinopharm had pre-orders for fewer than 500 million doses by mid-November, according to data from London consultancy Airfinity – mostly from countries that have participated in trials.
AstraZeneca, meanwhile, has pre-orders for 2.4 billion doses, and Pfizer has about half a billion orders.
Wider trust in Beijing has also plummeted this year, with a 14-nation study by the Pew Research Center finding a sharp deterioration in perceptions of the country.
“(Societies) that have increasing distrust in China are less likely to trust a Chinese-led vaccine candidate,” Kassam said.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 10, 2020 2:55 PM PHT"

The WHO’s new Global Health Estimates, adding 2019 data to statistics going back to 2000, found that people were living longer lives – but those extra years were not necessarily lived in good health.
The study, which exposes trends over the last two decades in mortality and morbidity caused by diseases and injuries, showed that NCDs made up just 4 of the top 10 causes of death back in 2000, rising to 7 last year.
COVID-19 is likely to figure in the 2020 top 10, WHO officials said, with the death toll having passed the 1.5 million mark on December 3.
In 2019, some 55.4 million deaths were recorded worldwide.
The top 10 causes of death accounted for 55% of those fatalities. They fall into 3 broad categories: cardiovascular, respiratory and neonatal.
The top 5 causes of death, in order, were heart disease; strokes; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; lower respiratory infections; and neonatal conditions.
They were followed by trachea, bronchus and lung cancers; Alzheimers’ disease and other dementias; diarrhea; diabetes; and kidney diseases.
The figures “clearly highlight the need for an intensified global focus on preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, as well as tackling injuries”, the WHO said in a statement.
Heart disease has been the world’s leading  cause of death for the last 20 years.
“However, it is now killing more people than ever before,” the WHO said, with 9 million fatalities in 2019 – up by two million since 2000.
Heart disease represents 16% of total deaths from all causes, with strokes claiming 11% and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 6%.
Diabetes has entered the top 10 causes of death following a 70% increase in the number of deaths since 2000.
Bente Mikkelsen, the WHO’s NCDs chief, said that although insulin was discovered nearly 100 years ago, fewer than half of the people who need it have access to it.
“There is an urgency to act,” she told reporters.
Mikkelsen said the most efficient way to protect people against NCD risk factors was “to increase the tax on tobacco and sugar-sweetened beverages” and other unhealthy products.
“It’s also a very important way to increase the health budgets.”
NCDs together accounted for 74% of deaths globally in 2019.
“We need to rapidly step up prevention, diagnosis and treatment of NCDs,” said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
HIV/AIDS dropped from the 8th-leading cause of death in 2000 to the 19th in 2019 – though it remains in 4th place in Africa, despite the number of deaths on the continent dropping from more than one million to 435,000 over the 20-year span.
Tuberculosis has also fallen out of the global top 10, dropping from 7th place in 2000 to 13th last year, thanks to a 30% reduction in global deaths.
The new estimates found that in low-income countries, communicable diseases took a heavier toll, accounting for 6 of the top 10 causes of death, including malaria (6th), tuberculosis (8th) and HIV/AIDS (9th).
Global average life expectancy was more than 73 years in 2019, compared with nearly 67 in 2000, with the biggest gains in the least-developed regions.

The warning came after two members of the state-run National Health Service who were among the first to receive the vaccine on Tuesday, December 8, suffered allergic reactions and needed treatment.
NHS England medical director Stephen Powis said both people, who had a history of reactions, were now recovering well.
The independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has now advised that “people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination” as a precaution, he added.
“Significant” allergic reactions include those to medicines, food or vaccines, according to the MHRA.
Thousands of Britons became the first in the Western world to received an approved COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday as the NHS began the biggest vaccination drive since it was created in 1948.
The vaccine is administered in two doses, 21 days apart. The over-80s and health and social care staff are first in line to get the jab in the national rollout.
Britain has received some 800,000 doses of the vaccine in the first batch of an order of 40 million. Up to 4 million doses are expected by the end of December.
Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla on Tuesday said he understood global concerns about the speed with which pharmaceutical companies have produced vaccines against COVID-19.
But he insisted no corners have been cut.
The vaccine had been tested “in the exact same way as we are testing any vaccine that is circulating out there,” he told a virtual media briefing in Geneva.
Pfizer said the MHRA had told it of the allergic reactions but said during phase 3 trials of more than 40,000 people, the vaccine was “generally well-tolerated with no serious safety concerns” reported.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 9, 2020 7:57 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/jj-readies-500-million-vaccine-doses-poor-countries/,J&J readies 500 million vaccine doses for poor countries,"US pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson said Tuesday, December 8, it plans to provide 500 million doses of its vaccine for poor countries once results of clinical trials are announced by the end of  January.
It plans to sell the vaccine at cost price and will provide the doses to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the group’s scientific director Paul Stoffels told a virtual round table in Geneva.
The vaccine is currently undergoing final-stage clinical trials involving 60,000 participants at more than 200 locations in the US and other countries. Results are expected in late January.
J&J’s Stoffels said the firm’s Phase III trials – which had to be interrupted briefly when one subject fell ill – are now “in full swing,” adding: “We target for results the month of January for efficacy and safety.”
AstraZeneca, a leading rival in the world scramble for a coronavirus vaccine, has also pledged to sell its candidate at cost – around 2.50 euros ($2.80) per dose – while Pfizer of the United States has targeted a top price of around $40.
J&J had said in September that it hoped to win emergency authorization to market its vaccine early next year.
Unlike some rival vaccines that require storage at extremely low temperatures, J&J’s can be kept at 2.0 degrees Centigrade (35.6 Fahrenheit).
Speaking at the same conference, organized by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), the head of Swiss lab Roche, Severin Schwan, said the at-cost model for vaccines could stymie innovation in the future.
“It’s a good model during a crisis, but I don’t think it can be a standard for sustainable innovation in the long run,” said Schwan, the IFPMA vice president.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 9, 2020 8:59 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/oxford-astrazeneca-first-publish-final-stage-vaccine-trial-results/,Oxford/Astra first to publish final-stage vaccine trial results,"Oxford University and AstraZeneca became the first COVID-19 vaccine makers to publish final-stage clinical trial results in a scientific journal Tuesday, December 8, clearing a key hurdle in the global race to produce safe and effective drugs for the new coronavirus.
The study, published in the respected Lancet medical journal, confirmed that the vaccine works in an average of 70% of cases.
It comes during a flurry of positive developments that have raised hopes the rollout of vaccines can help begin to restrain a pandemic that has killed more than 1.5 million people and stricken societies worldwide.
Britain on Tuesday became the first country in the Western world to start immunizations, using a rival vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech after approving it for general use last week.
Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said publication in the Lancet showed developers were “transparently sharing the data.”
He said a range of vaccines would be needed to bring the pandemic to heel, “otherwise we’ll still be in this position in 6 months time.”
“This really can’t be a competition between developers, this has to be in competition against the virus,” he told a press briefing.
The study showed the vaccine had an efficacy of 62% for those given two full doses, and of 90% in those given a half then a full dose.
AstraZeneca and Oxford faced questions last month about their analysis – which looks at data from a total of 23,000 people in separate trials with differing protocols – after releasing an overview of the results.
These centered on the smaller group who were given an initial half dose because of a mistake.
Tuesday’s study confirmed that this group of 1,367 participants did not include adults over the age of 55 years.
The authors said they provided extra analysis to Lancet peer reviewers that suggested improved results for the half-dose group was not down to other factors like age.
But they said more research would be needed.
AstraZeneca said it would be up to regulators to decide based on the data whether people would receive two full doses or a half dose followed by a full dose.
“I think it is fair to say it needs more looking into to explain the intriguing result,” Pollard said.
He confirmed that the use of a lower initial dose was “unplanned” and the result of a measurement discrepancy, but once researchers realized, it was incorporated into the trial with the agreement of regulators.
The results are likely to present a “dilemma” for regulators, said  Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology at the University of Reading.
He said while the half-dose regime showed better protection against disease and also in reducing asymptomatic transmission, the group was “relatively small.”
“Moreover it did not contain any older participants (age 55 or over) and it remains possible that if the regulators allowed the vaccine to be used in this manner, the most at risk group may not be protected.”
Overall, authors analyzed data from phase 3 – final stage – clinical trials in Britain and Brazil, involving 11,636 people, alongside safety data from a total of 23,745 participants in trials in Britain, Brazil and South Africa.
There were 131 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 disease more than 14 days after the second vaccine dose in these 11,636 people – 30 of those were among the group that received a vaccine of either dosage and 101 were in the control group.
The study said there had been no hospitalizations or severe disease reported in the COVID-19 vaccine group so far.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 9, 2020 12:08 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-vaccine-raises-no-specific-safety-concerns-us-regulator/,Pfizer vaccine raises ‘no specific safety concerns’ – US regulator,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a briefing document Tuesday, December 8, saying the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective, raising expectations the regulator is poised to grant emergency approval.
An independent committee advising the FDA will meet Thursday, December 10, on the matter, after Britain became the first country to approve the vaccine last week.
Data from 38,000 US trial participants revealed “suggest a favorable safety profile, with no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA (emergency use authorization),” the FDA document said.
It added that the vaccine’s efficacy in preventing COVID-19 was 95%, worked uniformly across age groups, genders, and racial groups, as well as people with underlying conditions who are at high risk.
The FDA said more research was needed to confirm evidence that the vaccine prevents even the worst cases of COVID-19, that it offers protection after the first of two doses and that it works for people previously been infected.
The companies have previously released some of their data in press statements but the FDA has access to a much more detail.
In a larger group of 43,000 volunteers which included additional adults and adolescents who signed up later, the most common side effects were injection site reactions (84%), fatigue (63%), headache (55%), muscle pain (38%), chills (31%), joint pain (23.6%), fever (14%).
Reactions graded as “severe” were more common after the second dose and less frequent in participants aged 55 and older.
There were some adverse events classed as “serious” – the highest grade – but there was no meaningful imbalance in the frequency these occurred in the vaccine and placebo arms.
There were 4 cases of Bell’s palsy – a non-serious form of facial paralysis that generally resolves – in the vaccine group and none in the placebo group, but the document said this was in line with the frequency seen in the general population.
The advisory group will also consider what additional studies the manufacturers will need to undertake after issuance of an EUA.
Notably, the FDA is not in favor of immediately offering the vaccine to people in the placebo group, which is currently a heated area of discussion among the scientific community.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 8, 2020 11:17 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-against-mandatory-covid-19-vaccines/,WHO against mandatory COVID-19 vaccines,"The World Health Organization said Monday, December 7, that persuading people on the merits of a COVID-19 vaccine would be far more effective than trying to make the jabs mandatory.
The WHO said it would be down to individual countries as to how they want to conduct their vaccination campaigns against the coronavirus pandemic.
But the UN health agency insisted making it mandatory to get immunized against the disease would be the wrong road to take, adding there were examples in the past of mandating vaccines use only to see it backfire with greater opposition to them.
“I don’t think that mandates are the direction to go in here, especially for these vaccines,” Kate O’Brien, director of the WHO’s immunization department, told a virtual news conference.
“It is a much better position to actually encourage and facilitate the vaccination without those kinds of requirements.
“I don’t think we envision any countries creating a mandate for vaccination.”
O’Brien said there may be certain hospital professions in which being vaccinated might be required or highly recommended for staff and patient safety.
But WHO experts admitted there was a battle to be fought to convince the general public to take the vaccines as they become available.
“The vaccine story is a good news story. It is the victory of human endeavour, potentially, over a microbial adversary,” said the organization’s emergencies director Michael Ryan.
“We need to convince people and we need to persuade.”
As for making vaccines mandatory, he said: “I think all of us who work in public health would rather avoid that as a means for getting people vaccinated.
“We are much better served to present people with the data and the benefits and let people make up their own minds.
“There are certain circumstances…where I would believe that the only responsible thing would be to be vaccinated,” he added.
According to the WHO’s overview of different candidate vaccines, 51 have entered human trials, 13 of which have reached final-stage mass testing.
A further 163 candidate vaccines are being developed in laboratories with a view to eventual human testing.
The world-first roll-out of the Pfizer vaccine is due to begin in Britain on Tuesday.
As countries begin deploying vaccines in the coming weeks and months, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged them to prioritise those most in need.
“These are not easy decisions,” he said, setting out the WHO guidelines.
Tedros said health workers at high risk of infection were a top priority, plus people at the highest risk of serious disease or death due to their age – thereby easing the pressure on health systems.
He said they should later be followed by people with a higher risk of severe disease due to underlying conditions, and marginalized groups at higher risk.
The WHO’s ACT-Accelerator mechanism, pooling risk and reward among countries rich and poor, is a global attempt to speed up the development of COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments, and purchase and distribute them evenly regardless of wealth.
However, the scheme needs $4.3 billion urgently, with a further $23.9 billion required in 2021.
“What we need now globally is not to enter the land of empty promises in terms of supporting the ACT-Accelerator,” said Ryan, urging wealthy donors to stump up.
“The means to do this allocation fairly and equitably is there. But what’s not in place is the financing to make that happen in 2021.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/spotting-liars-hard-new-method-effective-ethical/,Spotting liars is hard – but our new method is effective and ethical,"Most people lie occasionally. The lies are often trivial and essentially inconsequential – such as pretending to like a tasteless gift. But in other contexts, deception is more serious and can have harmful effects on criminal justice. From a societal perspective, such lying is better detected than ignored and tolerated.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to detect lies accurately. Lie detectors, such as polygraphs, which work by measuring the level of anxiety in a subject while they answer questions, are considered “theoretically weak” and of dubious reliability. This is because, as any traveler who has been questioned by customs officials knows, it’s possible to be anxious without being guilty.
We have developed a new approach to spot liars based on interviewing technique and psychological manipulation, with results just published in the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition.
Our technique is part of a new generation of cognitive-based lie-detection methods that are being increasingly researched and developed. These approaches postulate that the mental and strategic processes adopted by truth-tellers during interviews differ significantly from those of liars. By using specific techniques, these differences can be amplified and detected.
One such approach is the Asymmetric Information Management (AIM) technique. At its core, it is designed to provide suspects with a clear means to demonstrate their innocence or guilt to investigators by providing detailed information. Small details are the lifeblood of forensic investigations and can provide investigators with facts to check and witnesses to question. Importantly, longer, more detailed statements typically contain more clues to a deception than short statements.
Essentially, the AIM method involves informing suspects of these facts. Specifically, interviewers make it clear to interviewees that if they provide longer, more detailed statements about the event of interest, then the investigator will be better able to detect if they are telling the truth or lying. For truth-tellers, this is good news. For liars, this is less good news.
Indeed, research shows that when suspects are provided with these instructions, they behave differently depending on whether they are telling the truth or not. Truth-tellers typically seek to demonstrate their innocence and commonly provide more detailed information in response to such instructions.
In contrast, liars wish to conceal their guilt. This means they are more likely to strategically withhold information in response to the AIM instructions. Their (totally correct) assumption here is that providing more information will make it easier for the investigator to detect their lie, so instead, they provide less information.
This asymmetry in responses from liars and truth-tellers – from which the AIM technique derives its name – suggests two conclusions. When using the AIM instructions, if the investigator is presented with a potential suspect who is providing lots of detailed information, they are likely to be telling the truth. In contrast, if the potential suspect is lying then the investigator would typically be presented with shorter statements.
But how effective is this approach? Preliminary research on the AIM technique has been promising. For our study, we recruited 104 people who were sent on one of two covert missions to different locations in a university to retrieve and/or deposit intelligence material.
All interviewees were then told there had been a data breach in their absence. They were, therefore, a suspect and faced an interview with an independent analyst. Half were told to tell the truth about their mission to convince the interviewer of their innocence. The other half were told that they could not disclose any information about their mission, and that they should come up with a cover story about where they had been at the time and place of the breach to convince the analyst of their innocence.
They were then interviewed, and the AIM technique was used in half of the cases. We found that when the AIM technique was used, it was easier for the interviewer to spot liars. In fact, lie-detection accuracy rates increased from 48% (no AIM) to 81% – with truth-tellers providing more information.
Research is also exploring methods for enhancing the AIM technique using cues which may support truth-tellers to provide even more information. Recalling information can be difficult, and truth-tellers often struggle with their recall.
Memory tools known as “mnemonics” may be able to enhance this process. For example, if a witness of a robbery has provided an initial statement and cannot recall additional information, investigators could use a “change perspective” mnemonic – asking the witness to think about the events from the perspective of someone else (“what would a police officer have seen if they were there”). This can elicit new – previously unreported – information from memory.
If this is the case, our new technique could become even more accurate at being able to detect verbal differences between truth-tellers and liars.
Either way, our method is an ethical, non-accusatory and information-gathering approach to interviewing. The AIM instructions are simple to understand, easy to implement and appear promising. While initially tested for use in police suspect interviews, such instructions could be implemented in a variety of settings, such as insurance-claim settings. – TheConversation/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/vaccines-coronavirus-side-effects-good-thing/,Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will have side effects – that’s a good thing,"Takeaways
In 2021 hundreds of millions of people will be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The success of that COVID-19 vaccination campaign will heavily depend on public trust that the vaccines are not only effective, but also safe. To build that trust, the medical and scientific communities have a responsibility to engage in difficult discussions with the public about the significant fraction of people who will experience temporary side effects from these vaccines.
I am an immunologist who studies the fundamentals of immune responses to vaccination, so part of that responsibility falls on me.
Simply put, receiving these vaccines will likely make a whole lot of people feel crappy for a few days. That’s probably a good thing, and it’s a far better prospect than long-term illness or death.
In 1989, immunologist Charles Janeway published an article summarizing the state of the field of immunology. Until that point, immunologists had accepted that immune responses were initiated when encountering something foreign – bacteria, viruses, and parasites – that was “non-self.”
Janeway suspected that there was more to the story, and famously laid out what he referred to as “the immunologist’s dirty little secret”: Your immune system doesn’t just respond just to foreign things. It responds to foreign things that it perceives to be dangerous.
Now, 30 years later, immunologists know that your immune system uses a complex set of sensors to understand not only whether or not something is foreign, but also what kind of threat, if any, a microbe might pose. It can tell the difference between viruses – like SARS-CoV-2 – and parasites, like tapeworms, and activate specialized arms of your immune system to deal with those specific threats accordingly. It can even monitor the level of tissue damage caused by an invader, and ramp up your immune response to match.
Sensing the type of threat posed by a microbe, and the level of intensity of that threat, allows your immune system to select the right set of responses, wield them precisely, and avoid the very real danger of immune overreaction.
Vaccines work by introducing a safe version of a pathogen to a patient’s immune system. Your immune system remembers its past encounters and responds more efficiently if it sees the same pathogen again. However, it generates memory only if the vaccine packs enough danger signals to kick off a solid immune response.
As a result, your immune system’s need to sense danger before responding is at once extremely important (imagine if it started attacking the thousands of species of friendly bacteria in your gut!) and highly problematic. The requirement for danger means that your immune system is programmed not to respond unless a clear threat is identified. It also means that if I’m developing a vaccine, I have to convince your immune system that the vaccine itself is a threat worth taking seriously.
This can be accomplished in a number of ways. One is to inject a weakened – what immunologists call attenuated – or even killed version of a pathogen. This approach has the benefit of looking almost identical to the “real” pathogen, triggering many of the same danger signals and often resulting in strong, long-term immunity, as is seen in polio vaccination. It can also be risky – if you haven’t weakened the pathogen enough and roll out the vaccine too fast, there is a possibility of unintentionally infecting a large number of vaccine recipients. In addition to this unacceptable human cost, the resulting loss of trust in vaccines could lead to additional suffering as fewer people take other, safer vaccines.
A safer approach is to use individual components of the pathogen, harmless by themselves but capable of training your immune system to recognize the real thing. However, these pieces of the pathogen don’t often contain the danger signals necessary to stimulate a strong memory response. As a result, they need to be supplemented with synthetic danger signals, which immunologists refer to as “adjuvants.”
To make vaccines more effective, whole labs have been dedicated to the testing and development of new adjuvants. All are designed with the same basic purpose – to kick the immune system into action in a way that maximizes the effectiveness and longevity of the response. In doing so, we maximize the number of people that will benefit from the vaccine and the length of time those people are protected.
To do this, we take advantage of the same sensors that your immune system uses to sense damage in an active infection. That means that while they will stimulate an effective immune response, they will do so by producing temporary inflammatory effects. At a cellular level, the vaccine triggers inflammation at the injection site. Blood vessels in the area become a little more “leaky” to help recruit immune cells into the muscle tissue, causing the area to become red and swell. All of this kicks off a full-blown immune response in a lymph node somewhere nearby that will play out over the course of weeks.
In terms of symptoms, this can result in redness and swelling at the injection site, stiffness and soreness in the muscle, tenderness and swelling of the local lymph nodes and, if the vaccine is potent enough, even fever (and that associated generally crappy feeling).
This is the balance of vaccine design – maximizing protection and benefits while minimizing their uncomfortable, but necessary, side effects. That’s not to say that serious side effects don’t occur – they do – but they are exceedingly rare. Two of the most discussed serious side effects, anaphalaxis (a severe allergic reaction) and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (nerve damage due to inflammation), occur at a frequency of less than 1 in 500,000 doses.
Early data suggest that the mRNA vaccines in development against SARS-CoV-2 are highly effective – upwards of 90%. That means they are capable of stimulating robust immune responses, complete with sufficient danger signaling, in greater than 9 out of 10 patients. That’s a high number under any circumstances, and suggests that these vaccines are potent.
So let’s be clear here. You should expect to feel sore at the injection site the day after you get vaccinated. You should expect some redness and swelling, and you might even expect to feel generally run down for a day or two post-vaccination. All of these things are normal, anticipated and even intended.
While the data aren’t finalized, more than 2% of the Moderna vaccine recipients experienced what they categorized as severe temporary side effects such as fatigue and headache. The percentage of people who experience any side effects will be higher. These are signs that the vaccine is doing what it was designed to do – train your immune system to respond against something it might otherwise ignore so that you’ll be protected later. It does not mean that the vaccine gave you COVID-19.
It all comes down to this: Some time in the coming months, you will be given a simple choice to protect yourself, your loved ones and your community from a highly transmissible and deadly disease that results in long-term health consequences for a significant number of otherwise healthy people. It may cost you a few days of feeling sick.
Please choose wisely. – TheConversation/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/do-covid-19-antibodies-fade-more-quickly-in-men-than-women/,Do COVID-19 antibodies fade more quickly in men than women?,"In the global effort to overcome COVID-19, much scientific and medical attention has focused on the ability of our immune system to generate antibodies. Antibodies are one of our body’s main weapons against viruses, created to recognize specific proteins on a virus’s surface and initiate processes that ultimately neutralize and remove the virus.
We know that for other human coronaviruses, when the body creates antibodies against them, these then go on to provide immunity. Teams developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are confident, therefore, that their vaccines can produce similarly effective responses against COVID-19. But there is still much to understand – not least how long these vaccines will protect us for. Luckily, science is gradually catching up with the virus, and we are starting to understand more about antibody responses to it.
One unexpected finding was recently uncovered by a French study. The research (which is yet to be peer reviewed) examined SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the blood of hospital staff who had tested positive for the virus and were displaying mild symptoms. By analyzing two samples from each person taken a few months apart, the investigators were able to determine how quickly antibody levels fade after infection, and which factors were associated with this decline.
The study found that antibodies that recognized the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, one of the key proteins on the virus’s surface, decreased more quickly in men than women. As these levels fell, so too did the body’s ability to neutralize the virus. Although the study also looked at the effect of age and body mass index (BMI), neither of these variables were associated with more rapid antibody decline or were linked to the effect in men.
Antibodies specific to a different target, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, were also examined. These antibodies disappeared from the blood over time too, but unlike the spike protein antibodies, there was no difference in this decline between men and women.
Do these findings mean that immunity to reinfection disappears more quickly in men and that women are protected against the virus for longer?
Not necessarily. A closer look at the data reveals that, at the end of the study, there was no difference between the antibody levels in men and women. The more rapid rate of decline in men occurred because their antibody levels began at a higher starting point. As antibody levels in men had not fallen lower than those in women after six months, there is no indication that they are less protected.
However, the study does pose some intriguing questions. We know that older people, people with a higher BMI and men have a greater risk of severe COVID-19 and that higher antibody responses are seen in patients with more severe disease. In fact, the French study reported that each of these clinical or biological characteristics was linked to higher antibody levels soon after infection, suggesting that these patients probably suffered from more severe infections. But unlike in men generally, antibody levels in those with a higher BMI or who were older remained high afterwards.
If higher antibody levels are retained for longer in those who have had a more severe infection, why didn’t this seem to happen in men?
The question of how antibody levels are maintained in the blood has interested immunologists for years. Antibodies are produced by immune cells called plasma cells, which in turn develop from cells known as B lymphocytes. We know that for antibody responses to last, it’s crucial that plasma cells are able to stay alive for a long time too, in a special form known as long-lived plasma cells, or LLPCs.
We still don’t fully understand the critical factors that affect LLPC longevity. It is likely, though, that the characteristics of the LLPCs themselves, as well as contributing factors from their environment or “niche” within the body, are involved. These factors could well differ between men and women – sex-related differences in immune responses have been well described previously.
For example, women have more antibody-producing B lymphocytes and make more antibodies in general. So it may be that women make a more effective “measured” response to SARS-CoV-2 as a result, whereas the male response is more erratic: at first ineffective, then extreme during severe acute infection, but disappearing more rapidly once the infection is cleared.
Antibody-producing LLPCs are also not the only components of the immune response that are important for long-lived protection against viruses. A different type of immune cell – memory T lymphocytes – that persist long after the virus has been cleared and orchestrate a stronger, quicker immune response upon reinfection are also crucial.
Promisingly, data is now appearing to show that these cells, which can kill virus-infected cells as well as help with antibody production, also persist up to six months after initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 in both men and women.
There are high hopes that several effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will soon be available. Although it’s too early to say whether these will result in long-term protection, it is safe to say that to do so, they will need to effect long-lived antibody responses in both women and men. From what we’re beginning to see, the trajectory of these responses might be different in each sex. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/technology/world-health-organization-considers-e-certificates-covid-19-vaccination/,WHO looks at e-certificates for COVID-19 vaccination,"The World Health Organization said it was considering introducing electronic vaccination certificates, as hopes for an end to the pandemic were boosted after Britain became the first country to approve use of a COVID-19 vaccine.
“We are looking very closely into the use of technology in this COVID-19 response and one of them is how can we work with members states towards something called an e-vaccination certificate,” WHO Europe expert Siddhartha Datta told an online press briefing Thursday, December .
Introducing such a certificate, which would make it possible to identify and monitor people who have been vaccinated, has not been finalized and would have to be drawn up in accordance with national laws, Datta said.
It would not be an immunity passport, which is supposed to assure that its carrier is protected against the disease because they have been infected and recovered.
“We do not recommend immunity passports,” said Catherine Smallwood, the WHO’s senior emergency officer for Europe.
Tech-savvy Estonia earlier this year began testing an app that could serve as a kind of digital “immunity passport”, allowing users with antibodies to show employers and others their reduced risk of spreading the coronavirus.
Britain on Wednesday became the first country to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and the European Medicines Agency is due to announce its decision on December 29 at the latest.
The WHO’s Europe zone, which covers 53 countries including Russia, has recorded more than 19.3 million infections and more than 433,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according its data table, with 1.5 million cases recorded in the past 7 days.
“Whilst we are seeing a slight decrease in the number of cases in western Europe, this does not mean the entire WHO European region faces an improvement in the epidemiological situation,” said WHO Europe regional director Hans Kluge.
“The resurgence is moving eastward with the hardest-hit countries now in central and southern Europe,” he said, calling on governments not to lower their guard in the fight against the pandemic.
In the event of a fall in cases, “consider scaling-up the public health infrastructure and preparing for the next surge,” he said.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 4, 2020 4:18 PM PHT"

Kranjcec is bedridden due to her age and fragility but has no serious health conditions.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/vision-restoring-brain-implants-spell-breakthrough/,Mind’s eye: Vision-restoring brain implants spell breakthrough,"Scientists are a step closer to restoring vision for the blind, after building an implant that bypasses the eyes and allows monkeys to perceive artificially induced patterns in their brains.
The technology, developed by a team at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (NIN), was described in the journal Science on Thursday, December 3.
It builds on an idea first conceived decades ago: electrically stimulating the brain so it “sees” lit dots known as phosphenes, akin to pixels on a computer screen.
But the concept had never realized its full potential because of technical limitations.
A team led by NIN director Pieter Roelfsema developed implants consisting of 1,024 electrodes wired into the visual cortex of two sighted monkeys, resulting in a much higher resolution than has previously been achieved.
The visual cortex is located at the back of the brain and many of its features are common to humans and other primates.
“The number of electrodes that we have implanted in the visual cortex, and the number of artificial pixels that we can generate to produce high-resolution artificial images, is unprecedented,” said Roelfsema.
This allowed the pair of monkeys to make out shapes like letters of the alphabet, lines, and moving dots, which they’d previously been trained to respond to by moving their eyes in a particular direction to win a reward.
The monochrome patterns are still crude compared to real vision, but represent a major leap over previous implants, which allowed human users to only determine vague areas of light and dark.
Roelfsema likened it to a highway matrix board, and said his team now had a “proof of principle” that laid the foundation for a neuro-prosthetic device for the world’s 40 million blind people.
This might consist of a camera that the user wears or a pair of glasses, which uses artificial intelligence to convert what it sees into a pattern it can send to the user’s brain.
Similar technology has appeared in works of science fiction, such as the visor device worn by Geordi La Forge on “Star Trek: The Next Generation.”
In a written commentary, Michael Beauchamp and Daniel Yoshor of the University of Pennsylvania hailed the breakthrough as a “technical tour de force.”
The NIN team benefited from advances in miniaturization, and also devised a system to make sure their input currents were big enough to create noticeable dots, but not so great that the pixels grew too large.
They achieved this by placing some electrodes at a more advanced stage of the visual cortex, to monitor how much signal was coming through and then adjust the input.
Roelfsema said his team hopes to make similar devices for humans in about three years.
But the electrodes the team used require silicon needles that work for about a year before tissue builds up around the needles and they no longer function.
“So we want to create new types of electrodes that are better accepted by the body,” he said.
Ultimately, a wireless solution would be best, as it would mean the user wouldn’t need to wear an implant on the back of their skull, which requires scientists to operate and puts the user at risk of infection.
Fortunately, wireless devices that interface with the brain are advancing rapidly.
The prosthetics would only be suitable for people who once had sight and then lost it owing to disease or injury.
The brains of people who are born blind dedicate the visual cortex to other functions. But in people whose eyes stop working, the brain region remains idle, waiting for an input that never comes.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 4, 2020 11:45 AM PHT"

Between 85 and 100 million of the doses will be distributed in the United States, with the rest of the world receiving the remaining 15 to 25 million, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company said in a statement.
Moderna also confirmed that it expects to have 20 million vaccine doses available in the US by the end of 2020.
The company has been working on its American supply and production chain for months, in preparation for the vaccine’s expected emergency approval by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
For all countries outside the United States, production will take place in Switzerland.
US officials have said they plan to distribute 40 million vaccine doses by the end of the year, including those produced by Pfizer-BioNTech.
That would mean 20 million people vaccinated by the end of 2020, with each person requiring two doses.
The Moderna vaccine will be reviewed by an advisory committee of the FDA on December 17, and could be green-lit for emergency approval soon after.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/moderna-vaccine-confers-at-least-3-months-immunity-study/,Moderna vaccine confers at least 3 months immunity – study,"The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, which the company says was recently demonstrated to have 94% efficacy, causes the human immune system to produce potent antibodies that endure for at least 3 months, a study showed Thursday.
Researchers at the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which co-developed the drug, studied the immune response of 34 adult participants, young and old, from the first stage of a clinical trial.
Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, they said that the antibodies, which stop the SARS-CoV-2 virus from invading human cells, “declined slightly over time, as expected, but they remained elevated in all participants 3 months after the booster vaccination.”
The vaccine, called mRNA-1273, is administered in two injections given 28 days apart.
Even though the number of antibodies in the study subjects faded over time, it is not necessarily a cause for concern.
NIAID director Anthony Fauci and other experts have said it is very likely that the immune system will remember the virus if re-exposed later on, and then produce new antibodies.
Encouragingly, the study showed that the vaccine activated a certain type of immune cell that should help out in the so-called memory response, but only longer term study will confirm if this will really be the case.
“Positives from the study include evidence that a relatively strong antibody response remains 90 days after the second dose of the vaccine,” said virologist Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University-Texarkana.
“The amount of vaccine-produced antibodies was higher in younger patients than in older patients, but reasonably strong immune responses were still seen even in patients up to 70 years of age.”
The Moderna vaccine will be reviewed by an advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 17, and could be green-lit for emergency approval soon after.
Like another vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech, it is based on a new technology that uses genetic material in the form of mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid).
The mRNA is encased in a lipid molecule and injected into the arm, where it causes cells inside our muscles to build a surface protein of the coronavirus.
This tricks the immune system into believing it’s been infected with a microbe, and trains it to build the right kind of antibodies for when it encounters the real virus.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 4, 2020 9:50 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/laughing-is-good-for-your-mind-and-your-body-heres-what-the-research-shows/,Laughing is good for your mind and your body – here’s what the research shows,"Amusement and pleasant surprises – and the laughter they can trigger – add texture to the fabric of daily life.
Those giggles and guffaws can seem like just silly throwaways. But laughter, in response to funny events, actually takes a lot of work, because it activates many areas of the brain: areas that control motor, emotional, cognitive and social processing.
As I found when writing “An Introduction to the Psychology of Humor,”  researchers now appreciate laughter’s power to enhance physical and mental well-being.
People begin laughing in infancy, when it helps develop muscles and upper body strength. Laughter is not just breathing. It relies on complex combinations of facial muscles, often involving movement of the eyes, head and shoulders.
Laughter – doing it or observing it – activates multiple regions of the brain: the motor cortex, which controls muscles; the frontal lobe, which helps you understand context; and the limbic system, which modulates positive emotions. Turning all these circuits on strengthens neural connections and helps a healthy brain coordinate its activity.
By activating the neural pathways of emotions like joy and mirth, laughter can improve your mood and make your physical and emotional response to stress less intense. For example, laughing may help control brain levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, similar to what antidepressants do. By minimizing your brain’s responses to threats, it limits the release of neurotransmitters and hormones like cortisol that can wear down your cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems over time. Laughter’s kind of like an antidote to stress, which weakens these systems and increases vulnerability to diseases.
A good sense of humor and the laughter that follows depend on an ample measure of social intelligence and working memory resources.
Laughter, like humor, typically sparks from recognizing the incongruities or absurdities of a situation. You need to mentally resolve the surprising behavior or event – otherwise you won’t laugh; you might just be confused instead. Inferring the intentions of others and taking their perspective can enhance the intensity of the laughter and amusement you feel.
To “get” a joke or humorous situation, you need to be able to see the lighter side of things. You must believe that other possibilities besides the literal exist – think about being amused by comic strips with talking animals, like those found in “The Far Side.”
Many cognitive and social skills work together to help you monitor when and why laughter occurs during conversations. You don’t even need to hear a laugh to be able to laugh.  Deaf signers punctuate their signed sentences with laughter, much like emoticons in written text.
Laughter creates bonds and increases intimacy with others. Linguist Don Nilsen points out that chuckles and belly laughs seldom happen when alone, supporting their strong social role. Beginning early in life, infants’ laughter is an external sign of pleasure that helps strengthen bonds with caregivers.
Later, it’s an external sign of sharing an appreciation of the situation. For example, public speakers and comedians try to get a laugh to make audiences feel psychologically closer to them, to create intimacy.
By practicing a little laughter each day, you can enhance social skills that may not come naturally to you. When you laugh in response to humor, you share your feelings with others and learn from risks that your response will be accepted/shared/enjoyed by others and not be rejected/ignored/disliked.
In studies, psychologists have found that men with Type A personality characteristics, including competitiveness and time urgency, tend to laugh more, while women with those traits laugh less. Both sexes laugh more with others than when alone.
Positive psychology researchers study how people can live meaningful lives and thrive. Laughter produces positive emotions that lead to this kind of flourishing. These feelings – like amusement, happiness, mirth and joy – build resiliency and increase creative thinking. They increase subjective well-being and life satisfaction. Researchers find that these positive emotions experienced with humor and laughter correlate with appreciating the meaning of life and help older adults hold a benign view of difficulties they’ve faced over a lifetime.
Laughter in response to amusement is a healthy coping mechanism. When you laugh, you take yourself or the situation less seriously and may feel empowered to problem-solve. For example, psychologists measured the frequency and intensity of 41 people’s laughter over two weeks, along with their ratings of physical and mental stress. They found that the more laughter experienced, the lower the reported stress. Whether the instances of laughter were strong, medium or weak in intensity didn’t matter.
Maybe you want to grab some of these benefits for yourself – can you force laughter to work for you?
A growing number of therapists advocate using humor and laughter to help clients build trust and improve work environments; a review of five different studies found that measures of well-being did increase after laughter interventions. Sometimes called homeplay instead of homework, these interventions take the form of daily humor activities – surrounding yourself with funny people, watching a comedy that makes you laugh or writing down three funny things that happened today.
You can practice laughing even when alone. Intentionally take a perspective that appreciates the funny side of events. Laughing yoga is a technique of using breathing muscles to achieve the positive physical responses of natural laughing with forced laughter (ha ha hee hee ho ho).
Researchers today certainly aren’t laughing off its value, but a good deal of the research on laughter’s influence on mental and physical health is based on self-report measures. More psychological experimentation around laughter or the contexts in which it occurs will likely support the importance of laughing throughout your day, and maybe even suggest more ways to intentionally harness its benefits. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/us-jewish-doctor-tweets-treating-covid-patient-with-nazi-tattoos/,US Jewish doctor tweets on treating COVID patient with Nazi tattoos,"A Jewish doctor working with coronavirus patients in California shared his shock about the moment he saw neo-Nazi tattoos on the body of a severely ill man he was treating.
As his team – which included a Black nurse and a respiratory specialist of Asian descent – prepared the man to be intubated Taylor Nichols said on Twitter he spotted the Nazi tattoos.
“The swastika stood out boldly on his chest. SS tattoos and other insignia that had previously been covered by his shirt were now obvious to the room,” he tweeted Monday.
“We all saw. The symbols of hate on his body outwardly and proudly announced his views. We all knew what he thought of us. How he valued our lives,” said Nichols, who was later interviewed about his experience by various media outlets.
Nichols talked about the conflicting emotions he felt, after months of battling the disease and seeing patients die, while living in isolation to avoid contaminating loved ones, constantly in fear of falling ill himself.
“Unfortunately, society has proven unwilling to listen to the science or to our pleas. Begging for people to take this seriously, to stay home, wear a mask, to be the break in the chain of transmission,” he said.
Don’t let me die, doc
patient with Nazi tattoos
Nichols said the man – whom he described as older and heavy set, his teeth lost to years of methamphetamine abuse – had begged him to save his life.
“Don’t let me die, doc,” he said, according to Nichols.
The man was admitted to the hospital near Sacramento in the middle of November, already “clearly working hard to breathe. He looked sick. Uncomfortable. Scared.”
“I reassured him that we were all going to work hard to take care of him and keep him alive as best as we could,” said Nichols, admitting he had asked himself how the man might have acted had the roles been reversed.
“For the first time, I recognize that I hesitated, ambivalent. The pandemic has worn on me,” he said. “And I realize that maybe I’m not ok,” he finished his tweet thread.
Nichols later told the San Francisco Chronicle that when he saw the hate symbols tattooed on the man’s body, “I didn’t feel compassion for him in that moment.”
Working in a hospital which treats many people who are homeless or drug addicts during a raging pandemic, he added, had taken its toll.
Nichols said he did not know if the patient with the Nazi tattoos had died or not, but said he had done everything he could to save his life before moving on to the next patient.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 3, 2020 1:09 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/technology/innovations/artificial-intelligence-alphafold-untangles-biology-protein-folding/,AI untangles one of biology’s great challenges,"For decades scientists have been trying to figure out how to swiftly predict the twisting, tangled shape of proteins – and from there unravel a greater understanding of the machinery of life itself.
This week an Artificial Intelligence program created by Google sister firm DeepMind was shown to have virtually cracked the challenge, forecasting the way in which proteins contort into three-dimensional structures in the results of a biannual competition that judges hailed as a game changer.
“In some sense the problem is solved,” said John Moult, a computational biologist at the University of Maryland who co-founded the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) competition in 1994, quoted by the journal Nature.
Janet Thornton of the European Bioinformatics Institute said in a statement from the competition organizers on Monday, November 30, that the work to solve the problem was a “triumph of human curiosity, endeavor, and intelligence.”
“A better understanding of protein structures and the ability to predict them using a computer means a better understanding of life, evolution and, of course, human health and disease,” said Thornton, who is not affiliated with CASP or DeepMind.
The cells of all living beings contain thousands of proteins, workhorses that catalyze most chemical reactions in the body.
They are essential to life – from muscle function to carrying oxygen in the blood – and are also the key to diseases like cancer and even COVID-19.
A protein begins as a strand of amino acids, which then crumples into a unique three-dimensional tangle.
It is this shape that directly relates to its function.
Scientists have puzzled for half a century over how to accurately and quickly predict which formation – out of an unfathomably large number of possibilities – a protein might take by looking at its amino acid chain, a process that may take years in the laboratory.
The CASP contest involved around 100 teams who were given the amino acid sequences for dozens of proteins and tasked with estimating their final shapes — which were known to the organisers.
DeepMind – whose program AlphaGo stunned the world in 2016 by beating an elite human player in the complex strategy game “Go” – was already at the top of the field in the last contest in 2018.
This time its AlphaFold program determined the shape of many of the proteins “to a level of accuracy comparable to that achieved with expensive and time-consuming lab experiments”, according to the CASP organisers.
Andrei Lupas, an evolutionary biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology who was part of the assessment team, told Nature that AlphaFold had helped him determine the structure of a protein that his lab had been trying to pin down for a decade.
“This will change medicine. It will change research. It will change bioengineering. It will change everything,” he told Nature.
Derek Lowe, who writes about drug discovery and the pharma industry for Science Translational Medicine, described protein folding as like “watching piles of hinged lumber spontaneously restack themselves into functional boats, wagons and treehouses”.
He said the AlphaFold results did not mean the program would consistently come up with the right protein structure.
“But getting that level of structural accuracy on that many varied proteins is something that has just never been done before.”
DeepMind said it was looking at how the program might help increase knowledge of certain diseases, for example to identify whether a protein has malfunctioned.
“These insights could enable more precise work on drug development, complementing existing experimental methods to find promising treatments faster,” it said in a statement.
The firm added that it was working to produce a peer-reviewed paper and was “exploring how best to provide broader access to the system.”",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 3, 2020 12:34 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/milestone-anti-ageing-treatment-restores-sight-mice/,‘Milestone’ anti-ageing treatment restores sight in mice,"Scientists said Wednesday, December 2, they have restored sight in mice using a “milestone” treatment that returns cells to a more youthful state and could one day help treat glaucoma and other age-related diseases.
The process offers the tantalizing possibility of effectively turning back time at the cellular level, helping cells recover the ability to heal damage caused by injury, disease, and age.
“I’m excited about being able to rejuvenate organs and tissues that fail due to ageing and disease, especially where there are no effective treatments, such as dementia,” senior author of the study David Sinclair told AFP.
“We hope to treat glaucoma in human patients (at the trial stage) in two years,” added Sinclair, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School.
The treatment is based on the properties that cells have when the body is developing as an embryo. At that time, cells can repair and regenerate themselves, but that capacity declines rapidly with age.
The scientists reasoned that if cells could be induced to return to that youthful state, they would be able to repair damage.
To turn back the clock, they modified a process usually used to create the “blank slate” cells known as induced pluripotent stem cells.
Those cells are created by injecting a cocktail of 4 proteins that help reprogram a cell.
The team did not want to reprogram cells all the way back to that blank-slate status, but to restore them to a more youthful condition.
So they tweaked the cocktail, using just 3 of the “youth-restoring” proteins – dubbed OSK – in the hope they could turn the clock back to just the right point.
They targeted the retinal ganglion cells in the eye, which are linked to the brain through connections called axons.
These axons form the optic nerve – and damage to them caused by injury, ageing or disease causes poor vision and blindness.
To test the effects of the cocktail, they first injected OSK into the eyes of mice with optic nerve injuries.
They saw a twofold increase in the number of surviving retinal ganglion cells and a fivefold increase in nerve regrowth.
“The treatment allowed the nerves to grow back towards the brain. Normally they would simply die,” Sinclair said.
With signs OSK could reverse damage caused by injury, the team turned to countering the effects of disease – specifically glaucoma, which is the leading cause of blindness in humans.
They replicated the conditions of the disease, where a build-up of pressure in the eye damages the optic nerve, in several dozen mice.
Those who received the OSK treatment saw “significant” benefits, according to the study published in the journal Nature.
Tests showed “that half of the visual acuity lost from increased intraocular pressure was restored.”
The treatment offered similarly promising results in elderly mice with poor vision caused by age.
After the cocktail was injected, the mice’s vision improved and their optic nerve cells displayed electrical signals and other features akin to those in younger mice.
The study was conducted over the course of a year, and the mice displayed no side effects.
Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist at Stanford University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research, said the findings were “bound to ignite great excitement.”
The results will need to be confirmed in further animal tests, with a potentially long path before humans can be treated, but Huberman said they nevertheless represented “a milestone in the field.”
“The effects of OSK in people remain to be tested but the existing results suggest that OSK is likely to reprogramme brain neurons across species,” he wrote in a review commissioned by Nature.
“For decades, it was argued that understanding normal neural developmental processes would one day lead to the tools to repair the aged or damaged brain…(this) work makes it clear: that era has now arrived.”",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 3, 2020 9:17 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/frontrunners-race-covid-19-vaccine/,Frontrunners in race for COVID-19 vaccine,"Dozens of companies, from biotech start-ups to Big Pharma, are in the race to develop a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine, both to meet urgent medical need and for the potential payday.
A US-German collaboration between Pfizer and BioNTech surged past a key milestone on Wednesday, December 2, with Britain’s announcement that it would begin rolling out its vaccine – the first Western country to give the green light to an immunization drive against the coronavirus.
Its drug is one of several candidate vaccines that have shown promising results in final stage clinical trials, raising hopes the a pandemic that has already killed nearly 1.5 million people worldwide can be tamed.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 49 “candidate vaccines” at the stage of clinical trials in humans by mid-November, up from 11 in mid-June.
Thirteen of them are at the most advanced “Phase 3” stage, in which a vaccine’s effectiveness is tested on a large scale, generally on tens of thousands of people across several continents.
Two frontrunner vaccines – by Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer – have already sought emergency use approval on both sides of the Atlantic.
Pfizer and BioNTech have reported that phase 3 trials for their mRNA vaccine showed 95% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 symptoms and did not produce adverse side effects among thousands of volunteers.
Britain said on Wednesday that its National Health Service will begin with 800,000 doses “early next week” and ramp up to “millions” of inoculations by the end of the year.
BioNTech/Pfizer, which said they expect further regulatory decisions for other countries in the “coming days and weeks,” expect to roll out 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year.
US biotech firm Moderna has also said its vaccine showed almost 95% efficacy.
The company is on track to manufacture between 500 million to a billion doses globally in 2021, it said.
Results from a European project led by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca were more complicated.
Across two variants in the trials with slightly different protocols, the two-dose vaccine worked 70% of the time.
But in a part of the trial process that came about by mistake, a group whose first jab was a half-dose rather than a full one showed an efficacy rate of 90%.
In terms of logistics AstraZeneca has an advantage because its candidate can be stored at the temperature of a normal fridge.
Moderna’s vaccine on the other hand must be kept at -20 degrees Celsius, while Pfizer’s requires an even chillier -70C to remain viable.
Russia, which registered two COVID-19 vaccines before trials finished, has said that its Sputnik V vaccine is 95% effective according to preliminary data and can be stored in an ordinary fridge.
The country has started a mass vaccination program of its military personnel.
Meanwhile, several state-run Chinese labs are also thought to have produced some of the more promising candidate vaccines.
China has been giving experimental COVID-19 vaccines to people including state employees and essential workers heading abroad since July.
The United States and Europe this week fleshed out plans to administer COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they gain approval, expected in the coming weeks.
Some methods for making a vaccine are tried-and-tested, while others remain experimental.
Inactivated traditional vaccines use a virus germ that has been killed, while others use a weakened or “attenuated” strain.
These vaccines work when the body treats the deactivated pathogen as if it were a real threat, producing antibodies to kill it without endangering the patient with full infection.
So-called “sub-unit” vaccines contain a fragment of the virus or bacteria they are derived from to produce a similar immune response.
“Viral vector” varieties deliver fragments of viral DNA into cells, often hitching a lift from other virus molecules.
For example, a measles virus modified with a coronavirus protein – the apparatus SARS-CoV-2 uses to latch on to human cells – can by deployed to provide immunity to Covid-19.
Both Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines are based on cutting-edge technology that uses synthetic versions of molecules called messenger RNA to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.
Trials of two candidate vaccines – made by Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly – were “paused” in October over safety concerns.
But that was not necessarily bad news, Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said at the time.
“The fact that trials are paused should indicate that there should be confidence that the whole process of monitoring the safety of trial participants is working well,” he said.
Cases in which recovered COVID patients were infected a second time with a new strain also raise the question of how long vaccines’ protection might last.
In October, the US FDA said it would need to see two months of follow-up data after vaccination before giving emergency authorization for any vaccine use.
“What is different for COVID-19 vaccines is that speed of development and potential approval is much faster due to the public health emergency,” noted the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
But even that pressing need cannot overcome the rules.
“Before approval, all vaccines in the European Union are evaluated against the same high standards as any other medicine,” the EMA said in a statement.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 3, 2020 8:49 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/business/profile-biontech-german-firm-wins-coronavirus-vaccine-race/,BioNTech: Plucky German upstart wins COVID-19 vaccine race,"The small German biotech firm BioNTech, started by a husband and wife team with Turkish roots, had never brought a vaccine to market before.
But its experimental technology has now become the first authorized for use in the Western world to help end the coronavirus pandemic.
Along with its United States partner Pfizer, BioNTech on Wednesday, December 2, said its COVID-19 vaccine has been granted approval by Britain, with a rollout planned for as early as next week.
Mainz-based BioNTech was co-founded in 2008 by Ugur Sahin and his wife Ozlem Tureci, both scientists and the children of Turkish immigrants to Germany, as well as Austrian cancer expert Christoph Huber.
In normal times, BioNTech and its roughly 1,500 employees are focused on developing specialized immunotherapies for cancer patients based on “messenger RNA” (mRNA) molecules that trigger the building of proteins in cells, to stimulate the immune system.
It’s this same technology, which has the benefit that it can be developed more quickly than traditional vaccines, that lies at the heart of its COVID-19 shot.
The vaccine will introduce synthetic mRNA into the human body to trick the immune system into producing the viral proteins needed to provoke a safe but robust offensive against the coronavirus.
Sahin, 54, jumped into action in January shortly after reading about the emergence of a new and deadly coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
By the time much of the planet was in lockdown in March, BioNTech had developed 20 vaccine candidates based on mRNA technology, he told Der Spiegel weekly.
Those were eventually whittled down to a handful of the most promising options, with vaccine BNT162b2 now the frontrunner.
Having struck a deal with US pharma giant Pfizer to work together to develop mRNA-based flu vaccines in 2018, teaming up on a potential coronavirus vaccine was an obvious next move for BioNTech.
The two companies announced in March that they aimed to jointly develop a COVID-19 jab, “pairing Pfizer’s development, regulatory, and commercial capabilities with BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine technology and expertise,” they said at the time.
While global headlines tend to lead with Pfizer’s involvement, Sahin insisted to Spiegel: “It is our technology.”
The cooperation is a good fit because it allows BioNTech “to develop and distribute a possible vaccine in the shortest time possible,” he added.
The BNT162b2 vaccine will require two jabs to be effective.
BioNTech and Pfizer have said they expect to supply up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion in 2021.
In a clear sign that they were gearing up for mass production, BioNTech in September bought a manufacturing site in Marburg in western Germany from Swiss pharma group Novartis, along with its 300 employees, allowing it to produce millions of additional doses each year.
BioNTech already has two other production sites in Germany, while at least 4 Pfizer sites in the United States and Europe will join in the unprecedented effort to roll out a vaccine at record speed.
Sahin had told Agence France-Presse in an interview in November that if all the players involved – governments, pharma companies, and vaccine logistics firms – “do a really good job,” then “we can succeed in vaccinating 60% to 70% of the population by the autumn of 2021.”
“And when we’ve accomplished that then we could have a normal winter. Without another shutdown.”
Besides Britain, the European Union and a slew of countries including the US and Japan have already placed orders for millions of doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine as nations eagerly await the regulatory nods.
BioNTech has also struck a deal with Shanghai-based Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, which will have the exclusive rights to bring the vaccine to China.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 2, 2020 9:50 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-recommends-masks-indoors-poor-ventilation/,WHO recommends masks indoors if ventilation poor,"The World Health Organization on Wednesday, December 2, recommended wearing face masks when indoors with other people, if the ventilation has been deemed inadequate, in an update to its COVID-19 guidance on masks.
The new recommendations apply in areas of known or suspected cluster or community transmission of the new coronavirus.
“WHO advises that the general public should wear a non-medical mask in indoor (eg shops, shared workplaces, schools) or outdoor settings where physical distancing of at least one meter cannot be maintained,” the new guidance says.
“If indoors, unless ventilation has been assessed to be adequate, WHO advises that the general public should wear a non-medical mask, regardless of whether physical distancing of at least one meter can be maintained.”
The UN health agency also urged people not to wear masks during vigorous physical activity, and not to use masks with valves, saying they bypassed the filtration function of the face mask.
In its fourth update on mask guidance during the pandemic – the last was in August – the WHO called for wider use in healthcare settings, especially in areas plagued by infection clusters or community transmission.
In such cases, the WHO recommended “universal masking for all persons (staff, patients, visitors, service providers and others) within the health facility (including primary, secondary and tertiary care levels; outpatient care; and long-term care facilities)”
It also called for the wearing of masks by inpatients when physical distancing of at least one meter cannot be maintained or when patients were outside of their care areas.
More generally, the WHO continued to advise anyone suspected of having COVID-19 or awaiting test results to wear a medical mask when around others.
As for face shields, WHO said they “provide a level of eye protection only and should not be considered as an equivalent to masks” when it came to protection against respiratory droplets.
The organization said however that if masks were not available, or if people had difficulty wearing a non-medical mask – for example people with cognitive, respiratory or hearing impairments – then face shields may be considered as an alternative.
“If face shields are to be used, ensure proper design to cover the sides of the face and below the chin,” the guidance said.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 2, 2020 9:33 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/lab-grown-meat-on-sale-singapore-world-first/,Lab-grown meat to go on sale in Singapore in world first,"Lab-grown chicken will soon be available in restaurants in Singapore, after the city-state became the first to green-light meat created without slaughtering any animals.
US start-up Eat Just said Wednesday, December 2, that its meat had been approved for sale in the city-state as an ingredient in chicken nuggets.
The news marks a “breakthrough for the global food industry”, said the company, as firms increasingly try to find less environmentally harmful ways of producing meat.
“I’m sure that our regulatory approval for cultured meat will be the first of many in Singapore and in countries around the globe,” said Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just.
Consumption of regular meat is an environmental threat as cattle produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas, while logging forests to make way for animals destroys natural barriers against climate change.
Demand for sustainable alternatives to meat is rising due to growing consumer pressure, but other products in the market are plant-based.
There were concerns lab-grown varieties would be too expensive, but a spokesman for Eat Just said the company had made “considerable progress” in lowering the cost.
“Right from the start, we will be at price parity for premium chicken at a high-end restaurant,” he told AFP.
He did not reveal the price of the nuggets but said they would be launched soon at a Singapore restaurant, before other products including lab-grown chicken breasts are rolled out.
Eat Just hopes to bring down the cost to below that of conventional chicken in the coming years, the spokesman added.
The company conducted over 20 production runs in 1,200 liter bioreactors to make the chicken alternative, and checks on safety and quality showed its “cultured” product – the term for meat grown in labs from animal cells – met food standards.
Meat consumption is projected to increase over 70% by 2050, and lab-grown alternatives have a role to play in ensuring a safe, secure food supply, Eat Just said.
“Working in partnership with the broader agriculture sector and forward-thinking policymakers, companies like ours can help meet the increased demand for animal protein as our population climbs to 9.7 billion by 2050,” said company CEO Tetrick.
The Singapore Food Agency, the city-state’s regulator, confirmed it had approved the sale of Eat Just’s lab-grown chicken in nuggets after concluding it was safe for consumption.
The agency said it had put in place a framework for “novel foods” which do not have a history of being consumed by humans to ensure safety standards are met before they go on sale.
The high-tech city-state has become a hub for the development of sustainable foods in recent years, with local start-ups concocting dishes suited to Asian palates.
These range from lab-grown “seafood” to dumplings made with tropical fruit instead of pork.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 2, 2020 5:28 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/uk-approves-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-rollout/,UK first nation to roll out Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,"Britain on Wednesday, December 2, became the first western country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine for general use, announcing a rollout of Pfizer-BioNTech’s jab from next week in a major advance for humanity’s fightback against the coronavirus.
A mere 12 months after the pandemic began in China, the UK’s independent medicines regulator gave its green light in double-quick time but insisted safety had come first.
“Everybody can be confident that no corners whatsoever have been cut,” Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) chief executive June Raine told a news conference.
“The public deserve nothing less,” she said, stressing her agency’s certification process was no different to counterparts in the United States and the European Union.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the “fantastic” news, while urging the public to remain cautious on the day that England exited a four-week lockdown and reimposed regional curbs.
“It’s the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again,” he said.
Health secretary Matt Hancock said that starting with care home residents and health and care staff, Britain’s state-run National Health Service will begin with 800,000 doses “early next week.”
That will be ramped up to “millions” of inoculations by the end of the year.
“Help is on its way,” he told BBC radio.
The breakthrough will encourage hopes the world can finally get back on course in 2021 after a year of traumatic losses, both human and economic.
The novel coronavirus has killed nearly 1.5 million people since the outbreak emerged in China 12 months ago. At least 63 million cases have been registered.
Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla said the UK certification was a “historic moment in the fight against COVID-19.”
“This authorization is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the UK,” he said.
US giant Pfizer and German newcomer BioNTech added that they expected further regulatory decisions from other countries “in the coming days and weeks.”
The United States and Europe on Tuesday, December 1, fleshed out plans to administer COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they gain approval, with a US panel recommending that health care workers and nursing home residents be given top priority.
Other vaccines expected to come on stream soon include ones from Moderna and AstraZeneca/Oxford University, which has strong backing from the UK government.
Scientists also acclaimed the UK news but cautioned that logistical challenges remained. The Pfizer-BioNTech jab has to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit), requiring specialist freezers.
It requires two doses 21 days apart, and the MHRA said immunity kicks in a week after the second dose.
“It’s not easy but we’ve got those plans in place,” Hancock said.
Campaigners and governments have stepped up calls to ensure poorer countries enjoy equal access to successful vaccines.
The AstraZeneca/Oxford candidate can be kept in regular refrigerators and is being offered at cost price, but is undergoing further data analysis after questions were raised over the effectiveness of its dosage regime.
The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have both shown effectiveness against the coronavirus of around 95%. Both are based on new mRNA technology.
The mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) is used to deliver genetic material to the body that makes human cells create a protein from the virus. This trains the immune system to be ready to attack if it encounters the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Around 40% of US deaths have come from among the country’s 24 million care workers and nursing home residents.
The country has the world’s highest coronavirus toll, while Britain has the highest toll in Europe.
The announcement came as England exited its month-long coronavirus lockdown, but most of the country remained under restrictions as a new regional system for cutting infection rates kicked in.
Prime Minister Johnson, a COVID-19 survivor, succeeded in winning a vote on the measures in parliament late Tuesday, despite significant opposition within his own Conservative ranks which underlined growing fatigue around the world with curbs.
“All we need to do now is to hold our nerve until these vaccines are indeed in our grasp and indeed being injected into our arms,” he told lawmakers before the vote.
Until then “we cannot afford to relax, especially during the cold months of winter,” he warned.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/cold-hard-mission-for-united-states-warehouse-help-stop-covid-19/,"Cold, hard mission for a US warehouse: Help stop COVID-19","A warehouse in the US city of Baltimore may seem an unlikely place to help save the country from the COVID-19 pandemic, but Brian Gallizzo is prepared to do just that.
“We are ready, we have our tanks full,” Gallizzo, chief financial officer for the six-decade-old family firm Capitol Carbonic, told AFP.
How his company will help is by keeping things cool – extremely cool.
Capitol produces dry ice, a necessary component to distribute pharmaceutical giant Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, which could receive government approval soon.
Pfizer called Capitol because it was on the hunt for the quarter-inch pellets it spits out of a machine resembling a giant spaghetti maker in its Baltimore warehouse.
The dry ice pellets are needed to keep Pfizer’s vaccine at just the right, very chilly, temperature.
US regulators will decide next week whether to allow Pfizer to become the first major drugmaker to deploy its vaccine, and manufacturers like Capitol Carbonic are already finding themselves involved in one of the most important medical supply chains in history.
The vaccines from Pfizer and others nearing approval appear to be the United States’ best chance for ending the world’s largest COVID-19 outbreak, which is again surging to alarming levels nationwide.
But getting shots to people nationwide will be a logistical undertaking that will test the capabilities of the world’s largest shipping firms, the small businesses that undergird the US dry ice supply and the many other companies in between.
“We’ve never experienced anything like this before in the history of vaccine administration in the US, let alone globally,” said Omar Chane of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ life sciences management consultancy.
Anticipation for a vaccine’s approval is particularly high in the US, where COVID-19 has killed some 270,000 people and infected more than 13.6 million.
Several vaccines are under development, but the candidate from Pfizer and German firm BioNTech is nearest to approval and at the center of the US government’s immunization plan.
Assuming it’s approved, 6.4 million doses could be distributed starting soon after December 10, with 40 million available by the end of the month.
However that vaccine also has the strictest temperature requirement of -70 degrees Celsius, about 20 degrees warmer than the lowest temperature on earth recorded, in Antarctica.
Dry ice is the best way to maintain that temperature range, but it’s a complicated substance made of solidified carbon dioxide that begins turning to gas as soon as it’s manufactured.
In their basketball court-sized warehouse filled with the howl of super-cold machinery at work, Capitol Carbonic makes tens of thousands of pounds in a typical day.
They range from as large as a block to as small as a grain of rice — including the pellet Pfizer expressed interest in.
The drugmaker plans to move its vaccine in a special container packed with dry ice that can be opened briefly only twice a day and lasts for 15 days.
Shippers are readying for it: FedEx says it’s received special permission to transport the substance by air, while UPS said it’s going to install dry ice makers in some of its warehouses.
But at -79 degrees Celsius, dry ice is not easily made, and the unanswered question for John Dillinger, Capitol’s general manager, is how the containers will be kept cool.
“The nature of dry ice is, as soon as you make it, it starts to go away,” he said. “What happens if a CVS or a Walgreens gets it, and 11 days have gone and their suitcase has run out of ice?”
In the months before they heard from Pfizer, Capitol Carbonic was having a challenging year in which demand spiked thanks in part to homebound consumers ordering more food for delivery, shipments that need to be chilled by dry ice.
But the carbon dioxide they rely on comes as a byproduct of gasoline refining, and with fewer people driving, supply was squeezed.
“Honestly, this year was extremely unprecedented,” Gallizzo said.
Other vaccines under development can be stored at higher temperature ranges – for some, around that of a normal refrigerator.
Candidates include one from British drugs group AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, and another from Moderna and the US National Institutes of Health.
But experts say even those may require dry ice to keep them cold in transit.
“Every time that it moves through the hands of a materials handler, the external ambient temperature gets warmer, which impacts the temperature of the box,” said Glenn Richey, a supply chain management professor at Auburn University.
Barring renewed business shutdowns, Gallizzo is confident the dry ice industry can keep up with demand, but he’s less sure about the rest of the supply chain.
“It’s going to be a matter of figuring out how to get it to the customer,” he said. “That’s going to be our biggest issue.”",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 2, 2020 1:48 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/us-scientists-developing-nasal-spray-prevent-covid-19/,US scientists developing nasal spray to prevent COVID-19,"Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania and the biotech firm Regeneron are investigating whether technology developed for gene therapy can be used to make a nasal spray that will prevent infection with the new coronavirus.
The idea is to use a weakened virus as a delivery truck to carry genetic instructions to cells within the nose and the throat, which will in turn create powerful antibodies to stop SARS-CoV-2 from invading our bodies.
“The advantage of our approach is that you don’t need a competent immune system for this to be effective,” James Wilson, a professor of medicine at Penn who is leading the project told AFP.
The technology is currently being tested in animals and Wilson believes that, if successful, it could provide people with around 6 months of protection from a single dose, sprayed up the nose, and therefore complement vaccines that could soon be approved.
Wilson is a pioneer of gene therapy – delivering genetic code into a patient’s cells to correct for defects and treat disease.
His research team discovered that the Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) group of viruses, which infect both humans and other primates but aren’t known to cause disease, can be engineered to ferry healthy DNA into cells.
This approach led in 2019 to the approval of Zolgensma, the first drug for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, and today AAVs are being investigated for dozens of more possible applications.
Wilson was contacted by the US government in February to see if he and his lab could use the technology against COVID-19.
But it wasn’t until Regeneron developed two promising lab-made antibodies against the coronavirus, which bind to a surface protein of the pathogen and stop it from invading our cells, that his team could move ahead.
Regeneron’s antibodies are themselves in clinical testing but have received emergency approval for patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 who are at high-risk of getting severe disease – and were notably used recently to treat President Donald Trump.
Researchers are hoping that the nasal spray could be squirted through the nostrils, enter nasal epithelial cells, and hijack their protein-making machinery so that they make Regeneron’s antibodies.
Normally, only immune cells create antibodies, which makes the new idea a particularly innovative approach.
Since the coronavirus enters the lungs through the nasal passage, the spray could halt the infection in its tracks.
What’s more, AAVs cause only a  mild immune response so the side effects could be less severe than the frontrunner vaccines, which work by training the immune system to recognize a key protein of the virus.
Penn and Regeneron hope to complete their animal studies by January, before applying to the Food and Drug Administration to begin human trials.",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 2, 2020 8:31 AM PHT"

The dispersible HIV treatment is the first specifically made for children and will initially be available in 6 African countries in the first half of 2021, the global health development organization said in a statement.
The new formulation of the recommended first-line HIV treatment dolutegravir (DTG) will be made as a 10-milligram strawberry-flavored, dispersible tablet.
“A long-awaited HIV treatment designed specifically for children will now be available in low- and middle-income countries,” Unitaid said Tuesday.
“The new pricing agreement with generic manufacturers Viatris and Macleods means a new dispersible formulation of… DTG will be launched at a yearly cost of $36 per child, reduced from around $400.”
This will bring down the total cost of yearly pediatric HIV treatment by three quarters, from over $480 per child to under $120, said Unitaid, which works in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO).
Of the 1.7 million children living with HIV, around 100,000 die every year, said Unitaid.
It said that many children living with HIV have a poor response to treatment because they take anti-retroviral medication that is not correctly dosed, bitter to taste, or in tablet format that is difficult for babies to swallow.
An affordable DTG has thus far been unavailable for children weighing under 20 kilograms due to a lack of dispersible tablets, which are considered age-appropriate formulations, Unitaid said.
The product will be made initially available in Benin, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Uganda and Zimbabwe in the first half of 2021, with other countries set to follow.
Meg Doherty, the WHO’s global HIV program director, said there were 26 million people on anti-retroviral therapy worldwide.
She told journalists that out of 127 countries surveyed by the UN health agency, 12 were reporting critically-low stocks of anti-retroviral medicines due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/singapore-team-develops-way-selectively-kill-bacteria/,Singapore team develops way to selectively kill bacteria,"A team of researchers in Singapore have developed a method to selectively kill bacteria, while leaving others unharmed.
The discovery is considered a breakthrough because it is an alternative to antibiotics for treating existing drug-resistant bacteria and bacterial infections without the risk of causing resistance.
The Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Interdisciplinary Research Group (IRG) at Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) said in a statement that they have a found a way to produce customizable engineered lysins.
Lysins are enzymes produced by bacteriophages to break open the bacteria cells while treating infections, and have demonstrated potential as a novel class of antimicrobials. A major advantage of lysins is that they allow fast and targeted killing against specific bacterium of choice without inducing resistance.
The medical community worldwide has raised the alarm in the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. They said multidrug-resistant bacteria has left even minor bacterial infections incurable by many existing antibiotics
According to the World Health Organization at least 700,000 deaths each year are due to drug-resistant diseases.
In a paper titled “Engineered Lysins with Customized Lytic Activities Against Enterococci and Staphylococci” recently published in the prestigious journal Frontiers in Microbiology, the SMART AMR team demonstrated one of the methods to customize the lytic spectrum of engineered lysins.
The study reveals how SMART’s engineered lysins were able to selectively kill bacteria like Staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, while leaving the Enterococcus faecium bacteria of the same genus unharmed. This is the first report of a chimeric lysin that can both target bacteria of multiple genera as well as selectively kill one bacterial species within a genus over another.
“The human body contains trillions of bacteria, which form the microbiome, and the majority of the bacteria is either harmless or beneficial to us,” says AMR Research Scientist and corresponding author of the paper Dr Boon Chong Goh.
Goh added: “What happens when we are on an antibiotic course is that the antibiotics kill all of the bacteria, leaving us vulnerable to a worse re-infection after we have completed the antibiotic course. Since lysins respect the microbiome and only eliminate the bad pathogenic bacteria, they are a very promising alternative for treating bacterial infections.”

The World Health Organization has assembled an international team of 10 scientists to trace the origins of the virus.
They will have to investigate both the suspect animals and how the first patients may have been infected.
“We want to know the origin and we will do everything to know the origin,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Monday, November 30.
But success is by no means assured.
The first cases were reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan a year ago, before countries across the world began to record growing infections.
The WHO said the first cases in Wuhan are believed to date from the beginning of December.
But “where an epidemic is first detected does not necessarily reflect where it started,” it added in a November report.
In recent months, researchers in various countries have suggested that cases may have gone unnoticed long before December 2019, based on analysis of wastewater or blood samples.
But there is a lack of “clear evidence” to back up these claims, said Etienne Simon-Loriere, of the virology department at the Institut Pasteur in Paris.
To establish a virus family tree, researchers rely on genetic analysis.
This can help “better understand transmission dynamics, particularly how the virus may have evolved over time and how clusters might be related in time and place,” the WHO said.
Scientists agree that the disease has an animal origin.
“The big question is what led it to jump into humans,” Etienne Simon-Loriere told AFP.
Suspicions have fallen on bats, which are “a major reservoir for coronaviruses,” he adds.
But there would likely have been an intermediary animal to shepherd SARS-CoV-2 into people.
The pangolin – a mammal subject to rampant regional wildlife smuggling – was identified as a likely carrier early on based on genetic analysis. But the case is not settled.
WHO investigators will need to clarify this point by probing the wet market in Wuhan, which sold live and wild animals and has been linked to many of the early cases.
The team will be armed with clues we did not have at the start of the pandemic.
Simon-Loriere said they could look out for an animal with a virus receptor, a protein called ACE2, similar to the one found in humans.
It is through this receptor that the virus latches onto cells.
Some animals such as mink and ferrets have been found to have a very similar receptor to humans, while others are quite different.
Another origin theory that swirled in conspiracy rumors for months was that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was involved in the outbreak.
Against the backdrop of diplomatic tensions, US President Donald Trump touted the idea, claiming the virus could have leaked from the biosafety lab.
China has rejected the accusations.
While Simon-Loriere said it was not yet possible to completely rule out the idea that the virus escaped accidentally, he stressed that there was “no indication it was manmade.”
“All the elements of its genome have already been observed in nature, mainly in bat coronaviruses,” he said.
The WHO says understanding how an epidemic began is “essential to preventing further introductions to the human population.”
But it has warned that the process of tracing how a disease jumped from animals “is a riddle that can take years to solve.”
“The introduction of a new virus to the human population is one of the greatest mysteries an epidemiologist can hope to unravel,” it said.
The goal is to “understand the mechanism and put in place measures to avoid the emergence of a new SARS-CoV-3, 4, etc.,” said Simon-Loriere.
For example, during the 2002 SARS epidemic, a ban on the consumption of civet cats – identified as an intermediary host of that coronavirus – is credited with having helped prevent the reintroduction of the virus into humans.
The UN health agency sent an advance team to Beijing in July to lay the groundwork for the probe.
But it has remained unclear when the larger team will be able to travel to China to start its work.
In late November the WHO said it hoped to have a larger team of scientists on the ground “as soon as possible.”
The US has accused Beijing of not being transparent, while it says the WHO kowtowed to China and dragged its feet in investigating how the outbreak first started.
Others have voiced concern that the agency may have allowed China to dictate the terms of an international investigation into the origins of the virus.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/blood-test-may-accurately-predict-alzheimers/,Blood test may accurately predict Alzheimer’s – study,"Scientists said Monday, November 30, they had developed a way of predicting if patients will develop Alzheimer’s disease by analyzing their blood, in what experts hailed as a potential “gamechanger” in the fight against the debilitating condition.
Around 50 million people live with Alzheimer’s, a degenerative brain disease that accounts for more than half of global dementia cases.
While its precise mechanism is not fully understood, Alzheimer’s appears to result from the accumulation of proteins in the brain that are thought to lead to the death of neurons.
Some of these proteins are traceable in the blood of patients and tests based on their concentrations can be used to diagnose the disease.
Scientists in Sweden and Britain now believe blood tests can be used to predict Alzheimer’s years before the onset of symptoms.
Writing in the journal Nature Aging, they described how they developed and validated models of individual risk based on the levels of two key proteins in blood samples taken from more than 550 patients with minor cognitive impairments.
The model based off of these two proteins had an 88% success rate in predicting the onset of Alzheimers in the same patients over the course of 4 years.
They said that while further research was needed, their prediction method could have significant impact on Alzheimer’s cases, given that “plasma biomarkers” from blood tests are “promising due to their high accessibility and low cost.”
Richard Oakley, head of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, said the main struggle in battling the disease was diagnosing cases early enough to intervene with experimental treatments.
“If these blood biomarkers can predict Alzheimer’s in larger, more diverse groups, we could see a revolution in how we test new dementia drugs,” he said.
Musaid Husain, professor of neurology at the University of Oxford, described Monday’s research as a “potential gamechanger.”
“For the first time, we have a blood test that can predict well the risk of subsequent development of Alzheimer’s disease in people who have mild cognitive symptoms,” said Husain, who was not involved in the study.
“We need further validation (of the results) but in the context of other recent findings this could be a transformative step to earlier diagnosis, as well as testing new treatments at earlier stages of the disease.”",Agence France-Presse,"Dec 1, 2020 10:10 AM PHT"

“We believe that our vaccine will provide a new and powerful tool that may change the course of this pandemic and help prevent severe disease, hospitalizations and death,” said the company’s CEO Stephane Bancel.
If the US Food and Drug Administration agrees it is safe and effective, the first of the drug’s two doses could be injected into the arms of millions of Americans by the middle of December.
American pharmaceutical Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech applied for similar approvals last week, and their vaccine could be greenlit in the US shortly after December 10.
The Moderna vaccine, which was co-developed with the US National Institutes of Health, is being studied in a clinical trial with more than 30,000 participants across the United States.
An interim analysis announced earlier this month was based on 95 patients who fell sick with COVID-19.
The final analysis was based on 196 cases, 185 of which were observed in a group assigned a placebo versus 11 who received the shots.
Thirty people had severe cases – all of whom were in the placebo group – which also included one person who died.
Significantly, efficacy was uniform across age, race, ethnicity and gender, the company said.
The 196 COVID-19 cases included 33 adults over the age of 65, and 42 participants identifying as being from diverse communities (including 29 Hispanic, 6 Black, 4 Asian Americans and 3 multiracial participants).
The vaccine was generally well tolerated, with the most common side effects including injection site pain, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, and redness at the site.
These increased in frequency and severity after the second dose in the vaccinated group.
The press statement included the line: “no new serious safety concerns have been identified by the Company” – but it did not explicitly say whether serious concerns have been flagged previously.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-warns-malaria-fight-flat-lining/,WHO warns malaria fight flat-lining,"Progress in eliminating malaria has stalled in recent years, the World Health Organization said Monday, November 30, with more than 400,000 people once again estimated to have died from the disease last year.
In its World Malaria Report 2020, the WHO said progress against the mosquito-borne disease was plateauing, particularly in African countries bearing the brunt of cases and deaths.
In 2019, the global tally of malaria cases was estimated at 229 million – a figure that has been at the same level for the past 4 years.
Meanwhile the once rapidly-falling death toll has effectively come to a standstill in the last two years.
After steadily tumbling down from 736,000 in 2000, the disease claimed an estimated 411,000 lives in 2018 and 409,000 in 2019.
“A better targeting of interventions, new tools, and increased funding are needed to change the global trajectory of the disease and reach internationally-agreed targets,” the WHO said.
The UN health agency said a funding shortfall posed a “significant threat,” with only $3 billion of a $5.6 billion target raised in 2019.
“Funding shortages have led to critical gaps in access to proven malaria control tools,” it said.
Rather than a uniform approach, countries have recently begun to adopt tailored responses based on local data and intelligence, in order to try to keep up the pressure on malaria.
More than 90% of the disease burden is in Africa. The continent accounted for an estimated 384,000 malaria deaths last year.
“It is time for leaders across Africa – and the world – to rise once again to the challenge of malaria,” said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“Through joint action, and a commitment to leaving no one behind, we can achieve our shared vision of a world free of malaria,” the former Ethiopian health minister said.
In 2019, 4 countries accounted for nearly half of all malaria cases globally: Nigeria (27%); the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12%); Uganda (5%) and Mozambique (4%).
The WHO’s report found that most malaria prevention campaigns went ahead without major delays throughout the coronavirus pandemic.
But there were concerns that with efforts to tackle the disease flatlining, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis could prevent further progress.
“COVID-19 threatens to further derail our efforts to overcome malaria, particularly treating people with the disease,” said Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO’s regional director for Africa.
“Despite the devastating impact COVID-19 has had on African economies, international partners and countries need to do more to ensure that the resources are there to expand malaria programs which are making such a difference.”
The WHO said that even a moderate disruption in access to anti-malarial treatment could lead to considerable loss of life.
Its report said that a 10% disruption in access to effective treatment in sub-Saharan Africa could lead to 19,000 additional deaths.
The report said 21 countries had eliminated malaria over the last two decades.
Outside of Africa, it said India had continued to make impressive gains over the last two years, with an 18% reduction in cases and a 20% reduction in deaths.
And despite the ongoing threat of antimalarial drug resistance, the 6 countries of the Greater Mekong subregion of southeast Asia were making major gains towards their goal of malaria elimination by 2030, it said.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-cheaper-pfizers-modernas-not-require-supercold-temperature/,"Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine cheaper than Pfizer’s and Moderna’s, doesn’t require supercold temperature","The biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has released data on what is now the third promising vaccine candidate against COVID-19 – and it has several advantages over those of its competitors, Pfizer and Moderna.
On Monday, AstraZeneca released interim analysis of its phase 3 trial data of 23,000 volunteers from the U.K. and Brazil. These results show that the test vaccine is between 70% and 90% effective in stopping COVID-19, depending on the vaccine doses administered. Although less effective than the reported results from the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine candidates, this vaccine is still more effective than annual influenza vaccines that reduce the risk of flu by between 40% and 60%. Notably none of the vaccinated participants needed hospitalizations or reported severe disease.
Like most vaccine experts, I am intrigued by large differences in effectiveness between two tested dosages of AstraZeneca’s vaccine. Until March, I was developing vaccine candidates against Zika and dengue. Now I am coordinating a large crowd-sourced international effort to better understand the scope and severity of COVID-19 in cancer patients. The COVID-19 vaccine trials generally exclude most people with a history of cancer, so I am eagerly awaiting vaccine efficacy data for this risk group when these vaccines become widely available.
AstraZeneca’s vaccine was originally planned to be given in two full doses, 4 weeks apart, as injections in the upper arm. A third of the volunteers were injected with a dummy saline placebo.
One of the few details that AstraZeneca released is that of 131 cases of COVID-19, only 30 cases were detected among 11,636 who were given the vaccine; 101 cases occurred among the volunteers who got the placebo. That suggests that the vaccine is 70% effective overall.
However, an error in the early stages of the trial meant that some participants received only a half-dose in the first round. In the group of 2,741 volunteers who received a lower dose of the vaccine candidate followed a month later by a full booster dose, the efficacy was 90%, according to AstraZeneca. The efficacy was only 62% among the 8,895 volunteers who received both full doses.
It is not clear why the half-dose plus the full dose sequence of the vaccine performs better than two full doses. One explanation could be that since the vaccine is based on a common, although nonhuman, cold virus, the immune system probably attacks and destroys it when the first dose is too large.
It is also possible that progressively increasing the dose more closely mimics a natural coronavirus infection. Beginning with a lower first dose might be a better way of kicking the immune system into action; then a stronger, more effective immune response occurs after the second full booster dose. Despite enormous progress in human immunology, scientists still don’t understand the best strategies for inducing protective immunity.
These results are based on the evaluation of about one-third of volunteers who are expected to participate in this trial, which is ongoing in other parts of the world and will enroll up to 60,000 people.
AstraZeneca will now seek approval from the FDA to also evaluate the half-dose protocol in the ongoing U.S. trial. The current trial involves 30,000 participants and is evaluating only the two full-dose regimen. AstraZeneca’s trials in the U.S. were halted temporarily in early September after a study participant in the U.K. fell ill, but resumed in the U.K., Brazil, South Africa and Japan.
The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is another example of a new strategy being used to rapidly develop vaccines against the coronavirus that has already infected over 58 million people worldwide.
A vaccine works as a primer to train the immune system against a pathogen.
Conventional vaccines are made by weakened viruses or by purifying their disease-causing protein, such as the spike protein, which decorates the surface of a coronavirus. But these methods can take decades to develop new vaccines. Coinvented by the University of Oxford and its spinout company, Vaccitech, this vaccine uses different molecular tools to provide a preview of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the human body.
Instead of making weaker viruses, or delivering mRNA that encodes the spike protein, as Moderna and Pfizer did, the Oxford vaccine packs the DNA that codes for the spike protein in the shell of a genetically altered chimpanzee virus.
The original adenovirus causes common cold in chimpanzees and it rarely, if ever, infects humans. The virus is further modified to ensure that this chimp virus cannot grow in people. The AstraZeneca vaccine uses the modified virus as a vehicle to deliver the COVID-19-causing spike or S-protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Under the agreement with the University of Oxford, AstraZeneca is responsible for development, worldwide manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine.
This isn’t the first time that University of Oxford scientists have tried a vaccine using this harmless virus. Previously, it tested the concept against a closely related coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in animal studies. So this time, soon after the sequence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 became available, the Oxford scientists retooled the chimp virus for a vaccine that induced robust immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and rhesus macaques.
Despite a somewhat later arrival, with less than the effectiveness claimed by its competitors, AstraZeneca’s vaccine might be favored because it can be stored, transported and handled at standard refrigerated conditions of between 36 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 6 months.
The competing mRNA vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech require ultracold temperatures for stability. So the AstraZeneca vaccine will be easier to use in normal clinics, especially in rural America and the developing world.
Another important advantage of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being tested in collaboration with a larger number of global sites, is that it should cost less because of AstraZeneca’s commitment to COVAX, a global initiative that aims to distribute low-cost vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. Pfizer and Moderna have not joined the COVAX initiative, but AstraZeneca has agreed to make the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.
However, like all other candidate vaccines for COVID-19, AstraZeneca’s vaccine is also lacking in key details such as the breakdown in infections, the durability, or the efficacy in the different age groups of trial participants.
For all the vaccine candidates, we have only preliminary data from a small number of infections, and none of the groups developing the COVID-19 vaccine candidates has so far published complete data. So it is difficult to fully assess the differences between them.
We will have to wait for more follow-up and longer-term data to evaluate the effectiveness of all the COVID-19 vaccines in finally getting the COVID-19 pandemic under control.  – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/astrazeneca-says-vaccine-needs-additional-study/,AstraZeneca says its vaccine needs ‘additional study’,"The head of British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca said on Thursday, November 26, further research was needed on its COVID-19 vaccine after questions emerged over the protection it offers, but the additional testing is unlikely to affect regulatory approval in Europe.
AstraZeneca and its partner, the University of Oxford, announced on Monday that it was seeking regulatory approval for the vaccine after it showed an average 70% effectiveness.
That rate jumped to 90% when an initial half-dose then a full dose was given, similar to that in rival vaccines in development by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.
But US scientists have said the higher rate of effectiveness came during tests in people aged 55 and under, and was discovered by accident during the clinical trials.
The head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, Andrew Pollard, said this week that further evidence will be available next month, but the result was still “highly significant.”
“Now that we’ve found what looks like a better efficacy, we have to validate this, so we need to do an additional study,” AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot told Bloomberg.
He said he expected that to be another “international study but this one could be faster because we know the efficacy is high, so we need a smaller number of patients.”
The additional trial was not likely to delay regulatory approval in Britain and the European Union, Soriot said.
There are high hopes for the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, which Pollard has hailed as a “vaccine for the world,” given that it could be cheaper to make, and easier to store and distribute.
It can be stored, transported, and handled at normal refrigerated conditions of between two and 8 degrees Celsius (36-46 Fahrenheit) for at least 6 months.
Pfizer/BioNTech’s offering requires temperatures of -70C, driving up costs and potentially making it out of reach for lower and middle-income countries.
AstraZeneca/Oxford has also promised to provide its vaccine to the developing world on a non-profit basis.
The World Health Organization said it looked forward to the full publication of the data from the trial.
“On a review of the detailed data, we will be better positioned to understand the vaccine performance,” it said.
The chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, also cautioned against drawing premature conclusions, and urged patience until the data were published in peer-reviewed journals.
“It’s always a mistake to make too many judgments early and in particular before the independent regulator has had a chance to look at the results,” he told a news conference.
Helen Fletcher, professor of immunology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the safety data available on the vaccine had been “very robust.”
“It’s possible that a lower initial vaccine dose could result in higher vaccine efficacy…. More is not necessarily better when it comes to vaccines and immunotherapies,” she said.
“It’s also possible that a strong immune response to the first vaccine could effectively block an immune response to the second shot of the same virus.”
Fletcher’s colleague, professor of pharmacoepidemiology Stephen Evans, said speculation about the age distribution in the trials was “not useful to anyone.”
“We have good grounds for trusting that the regulation in this high-profile area will be done as carefully or more carefully for these vaccines than for any others in the past,” he said.
Gillies O’Bryan-Tear, from the UK Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine, said “the eventual efficacy rate may change,” but “the validity of the low dose/high dose group results are unlikely to be questioned.”
“Even if they (the regulators) decided to ignore the results of the low dose/high dose group, the study of the high dose/high dose patients will still be strongly significant, but I think that it unlikely,” he said.

On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) is alerted to a cluster of pneumonia cases “of unknown cause” in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
On January 7, 2020 a new coronavirus is identified. Four days later China announces its first death in Wuhan from an illness which will be named COVID-19.
On January 23 Wuhan is placed under quarantine and cut off from the world. Countries start to repatriate their citizens from China.
On February 15 France reports the first death confirmed outside Asia, a Chinese tourist.
By March 6 more than 100,000 cases have been recorded around the world.
Northern Italy is locked down, quickly followed by the rest of the country.
On March 11, the WHO says COVID-19 is a pandemic.
Global stock markets crash.
Governments and central banks roll out massive economic support measures.
Spain (March 14) and France (March 17) order their populations to stay at home. Germany and Britain say people should avoid all social contact. The 27-nation European Union closes its external borders.
On March 24, the Tokyo summer Olympics scheduled for July 2020 are put off to the next year.
The next day the United Nations warns that the pandemic is “threatening the whole of humanity”.
Lockdown measures are enforced all around the world.
On April 2 more than 3.9 billion people – half of the world’s population – are forced or called on to confine themselves, according to an AFP count. The same day the threshold of one million cases is crossed.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is infected and ends up in intensive care.
On April 29 the battered US aircraft manufacturer Boeing slashes 16,000 jobs.
Many other groups including airlines and car manufacturers follow.
Backed by US President Donald Trump as a potential treatment for COVID-19, malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is judged to have no benefit in a study published in The Lancet on May 22.
The study is retracted due to problems with the data but on June 5 a British research group also concludes that the medicine did not help COVID-19 patients at all.
By June 7 the death toll reaches more than 400,000.
The surge of cases and deaths in Latin America causes concern.
Brazil becomes the country with the second biggest death toll after the United States. Its president Jair Bolsonaro calls it a “little flu”, before himself becoming infected. Fellow COVID-19 sceptic Donald Trump will also get it.
With cases on the increase, several European countries make mask wearing compulsory on public transport, in schools and shops and on the street, starting with the Czech Republic on March 18.
Anti-mask demonstrations are organized in Berlin, London, Paris and Rome.
The grim milestone of a million deaths worldwide is passed on September 28. In October infections start to spiral in Europe, where many countries order new lockdowns and curfews.
The pandemic also picks up pace in the US, where its handling has become a key issue in the presidential campaign.
On November 9, US biotech giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech unveil positive results of a vaccine, as the number of official cases passes 50 million.
A week later a similar announcement comes from US firm Moderna, with an AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine following fast behind. Authorities hope to begin vaccination campaigns at the end of the year in the US and parts of Europe.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 26, 2020 1:26 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/after-year-long-sprint-covid-19-vaccines-finally-at-hand/,"After year-long sprint, COVID-19 vaccines finally at hand","Less than a year after an unknown coronavirus that has claimed 1.4 million lives began spreading across the globe, a number of highly promising COVID-19 vaccines are on the cusp of release.
Health authorities could give a green light for emergency use within weeks, which would mark the most rapid vaccine development for a pandemic in history – but many questions remain.
After months without a visible breakthrough, everything sped up in November, when several pharmaceutical companies made encouraging preliminary announcements about the efficacy of their vaccines.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA), charged with overseeing drug approval in the European Union, told AFP that it could approve the first COVID-19 vaccines by the end of the year, or early in 2021. France, Spain and Italy have all sketched out distribution plans on that basis.
Across the Atlantic, vaccination campaigns could start in the United States as early as mid-December, assuming the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves an accelerated timetable for rollout.
Chinese authorities have already begun jabbing high-risk patients, and in Russia two vaccines were validated for use even before the final phase of clinical trials had begun.
Researching, testing, approving, manufacturing, and distributing a new vaccine usually takes a decade or longer.
The breakneck pace of development, resulting in half-a-dozen COVID-19 vaccines, saw an unprecedented blitzkrieg of public and private research backed by a huge sums of money and provisional orders for billions of doses.
But all parties involved insist that corners have not been cut.
The EU’s regulatory agency, for example, acknowledged an effort “to speed up” the evaluation process, but insisted it was “ensuring the same high regulatory standards for quality, safety, and efficacy” as for any other drug.
But this extraordinary achievement will not mean that a waiting world will be vaccinated right away.
“Initial supply of #COVID19 vaccines will be limited, so #healthworkers, older people and other at-risk populations will be prioritized,” World Health Organization (WHO) head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus recently tweeted.
The world’s poorest countries, he warned, should not have to wait until wealthy ones that have reserved billions of doses are served.
“The urgency with which vaccines have been developed must be matched by the same urgency to distribute them fairly,” he said, highlighting the risk that the poor and vulnerable will be “trampled in the stampede” to get inoculated.
Too early to say. Since November 9, four drug makers have announced that their vaccines work, most of them more than 90% of the time.
The first to report Phase 3 results was the US-German collaboration between pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German biotech start-up BioNTech, followed by the US firm Moderna, a British partnership between AstraZeneca and Oxford University, and Russia’s state-run Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology.
But the rush for results in anticipation of a huge global market means the announcements were made by the companies themselves, and have yet to be backed up by publication in peer-reviewed journals, which can take months.
All the vaccines unveiled are near the end of so-called Phase 3 clinical trials, the final step in a process that tests safety and efficacy on tens of thousands of volunteers of different ages and ethnicities spread across the world.
Basically, the efficacy of a vaccine is determined by comparing the number of people who get sick with COVID-19 in a group of vaccinated volunteers compared to another group that receives a placebo instead of the active drug.
The threshold for releasing the findings – the number of people infected with COVID-19 – was different in each case: 170 for Pfizer/BioNTech, 95 for Moderna, 131 for AstraZeneca/Oxford, and only 39 for the Gamaleya Institute.
Pfizer reported 95% efficacy, with only 8 of the 170 COVID-19 patients coming from the vaccinated group. For Moderna – with 94.5% efficacy – it was almost identical, while Gamaleya’s Sputnik V vaccine reported 91.4% efficacy.
The calculations for AstraZeneca’s two-dose vaccine were more complicated. Across two separate trials with slightly different protocols, the drug worked 70% of the time.
But in a group whose first jab was a half-dose rather than a full one, the efficacy rate rose to 90%, putting it in the same league as the others. The counterintuitive result – less vaccine conferring more protection – stemmed from the reaction of the immune system, the company said.
But the success rate is not the only criterion in determining which vaccine will be adopted in different circumstances. Cost and logistics are also factors.
AstraZeneca’s double jab, for example, is by far the least expensive, at about 2.5 euros ($3) per dose.
It also has a significant advantage when it comes to transport and storage. Moderna’s vaccine must be kept at -20 degrees Celsius, while Pfizer’s requires an even chillier -70C to remain viable. AstraZeneca’s vaccine, by contrast, can be stored at the temperature of a normal fridge.
There are plenty, including some big ones.
“We knew that a vaccine would be essential for bringing the pandemic under control,” Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted. “But it’s important to emphasize that a vaccine will complement the other tools we have, not replace them.”
That said, the WHO chief, added, “the light at the end of this long, dark tunnel is growing brighter.”
The biggest question mark hanging over all of these vaccines is how long immunity lasts. All the results were reported only a few weeks after the vaccines were administered.
“How long will protection last? Will vaccination result in virus ‘escape’ mutations which limit vaccine effectiveness over time?” Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, told journalists, listing things we still need to know.
A handful of reinfections, in which people recovered from COVID-19 only to become infected by a slightly different strain, also raise questions about the duration of immunity.
Scientists also still don’t know if the vaccines will be as effective with high-risk individuals, especially the elderly, who are far more susceptible to life-threatening symptoms.
Yet another “known unknown” is whether an effective vaccine simply eliminates the symptoms, or whether it also prevents someone from transmitting the virus to others.
In other words, even if it protects you from getting sick, will it protect others you come into contact with from catching the bug?
Here again, AstraZeneca may have an edge on the competition.
“The Oxford/AstraZeneca team has been collecting weekly nasal and throat swabs from all trial participants to look for asymptomatic infections,” Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh, told the Science Media Center in London.
The drug maker found “early indication” that the vaccine could reduce virus transmission.
Contacted by AFP, AstraZeneca noted that not all 23,000 people in their trial were tested for asymptomatic cases, but did not say how many were.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 48 “candidate vaccines” at the stage of clinical trials in humans by mid-November, but only 11 at the most advanced Phase 3 stage.
Besides the 4 that announced results this month are several Chinese vaccines from state-run laboratories, made by Sinovac, Sinopharm, and CanSino.
The WHO has identified another 164 vaccine projects that are still in the pre-clinical phase of development.
Some methods for making a vaccine are tried-and-tested, while others remain experimental.
Inactivated traditional vaccines use a virus germ that has been killed, while others use a weakened or “attenuated” strain.
These vaccines work when the body treats the deactivated pathogen as if it were a real threat, producing antibodies to kill it without endangering the patient with full infection.
So-called “sub-unit” vaccines contain a fragment of the virus or bacteria they are derived from to produce a similar immune response.
“Viral vector” varieties deliver fragments of viral DNA into cells, often hitching a lift off of other virus molecules.
For example, a measles virus modified with a coronavirus protein – the apparatus SARS-CoV-2 uses to latch on to human cells – can be deployed to provide immunity to COVID-19.
Both Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines are based on cutting-edge technology that uses synthetic versions of molecules called messenger RNA to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.
Whichever vaccine is the first to be distributed, there’s a final question that scientists are powerless to answer but that could determine the success of their efforts: in an era of deep mistrust of authority, how many people will refuse to be vaccinated?
According to a study last month in the Royal Society journal Open Science, a significant percentage of people in many countries subscribe to conspiracy theories about the origin of the vaccines, or the virus itself.
In Mexico, for example, more than a fifth of those questioned said they thought the pandemic itself was “part of a plan to impose vaccinations worldwide.”
A survey published earlier this month by the World Economic Forum covering 15 countries found that the number of people willing to be vaccinated had dropped since August from 77 to 73%.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 26, 2020 10:23 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/coronavirus-treatments-some-progress-no-panacea/,"Coronavirus treatments: Some progress, no panacea","Nearly a year after a mysterious pneumonia emerged in China and began its global spread, there is still no silver bullet treatment for COVID-19 despite an unprecedented effort to discover new medicines or repurpose existing drugs.
A single family of cheap, widely available medications – corticosteroids – has proven its effectiveness, but some other drugs that were initially hyped have disappointed.
Dexamethasone:
This is the only treatment that has reduced mortality from COVID-19, although it has only been shown to work for patients who are severely ill in hospital and need oxygen therapy.
The World Health Organization (WHO), as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have been recommending dexamethasone for these patients since September, based on the findings of a large British clinical trial called Recovery.
Dexamethasone can actually inhibit the immune system, so it should not be given to those in the early stage of the disease.
But this is why it works in those who are very ill – it acts to tame a runaway immune response, which can trigger the inflammation characteristically seen in severe forms of disease.
And it appears that it’s not just dexamethasone.
Research published in early September in the American medical journal Jama showed that other drugs in the same corticosteroid family could also be effective, reducing mortality by 21% after 28 days for patients with severe COVID-19.
This led the WHO to recommend “systematic” use of corticosteroids in severe and critical patients.
Anticoagulants:
Like corticosteroids, these drugs are used only in the most severely ill patients. The goal is to prevent blood clots, one of the serious complications of COVID-19.
Remdesivir:
For a time this antiviral treatment had the hopes of the world riding on it.
The drug, developed for Ebola, was initially thought to be very promising.
The European Commission announced that it had ordered 500,000 doses in October, while the US granted it permanent authorization for use.
Its manufacturer, US pharma giant Gilead, has said the drug boosted 2020 third quarter sales by almost $900 million (756 million euros).
But it has not lived up to expectations.
On November 20, the WHO said remdesivir should not be used to treat COVID-19 patients no matter how serious their illness, saying it had “no important effect” on survival chances.
That does not mean it is proved to be ineffective, but rather that it had not been shown to improve patient outcomes.
There were also concerns about possible side effects, particularly affecting the kidneys, as well as the drug’s cost.
The WHO advice was based on 4 international randomized clinical trials involving more than 7,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
Hydroxychloroquine:
This drug became a lightning rod for politicized debates over the pandemic.
Used as a treatment for malaria or autoimmune diseases, depending on the country, hydroxychloroquine was touted as something of a miracle cure by its proponents – notably US President Donald Trump – despite a lack of evidence that it worked.
Among scientists, controversial French professor Didier Raoult argued vociferously in favor of the drug.
Hydroxychloroquine was at the center of an academic scandal, when the prestigious medical journal the Lancet had to retract a study that suggested negative effects from the drug, after concerns were raised about the underlying data.
The retraction of research critical of hydroxychloroquine only served to galvanise supporters of the drug.
But study after study has shown that it is not effective against COVID-19 including the British trial Recovery, whose results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in October.
Lopinavir-ritonavir:
Used against HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, this one-two antiviral punch has shown to be ineffective at treating COVID-19 in hospital settings, according to the Recovery trial, which published its results in the Lancet in October.
Tocilizumab:
Scientists hope this immunosuppressant, currently used against rheumatoid arthritis, will be able to prevent potentially deadly inflammation in serious cases.
So far, however, studies have not yet provided a definitive answer.
Researchers from Imperial College London announced on November 19 that tocilizumab appeared to be having a beneficial effect, according to preliminary results from their clinical trial.
The larger-scale Recovery trial may reveal more in the coming weeks.
Synthetic antibodies:
When the body fights off viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 it develops antibodies — proteins that are programmed to target specific pathogens.
These antibodies can be synthesized in a lab and could in theory be given to patients sick with COVID-19 to boost their own natural immune response.
Trump received this still experimental treatment, manufactured by the American biotechnology company Regeneron, when he was hospitalized with the virus.
This treatment, and one of the same type manufactured by Eli Lilly, have received authorization for emergency use in the US.
But their effectiveness continues to be evaluated, with the Regeneron treatment included in the Recovery trial.
Plasma:
Plasma taken from the blood of recovered patients showed some early promise when given intravenously to people sick with COVID-19.
It has already shown to help speed recovery from Ebola as well as SARS, which is caused by the same family of pathogens as the novel coronavirus.
Recovery has an ongoing clinical trial for plasma treatment.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 26, 2020 10:12 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pandemic-or-not-people-must-stay-active-who/,"Pandemic or not, people must stay active – WHO","The coronavirus pandemic is no excuse for not getting enough exercise, the World Health Organization said Wednesday, November 25, warning that even before the crisis many were getting too little physical activity.
In an update of its physical activity guidelines, the UN health agency stressed that exercise was vital to physical and mental health, while sedentary behavior can have serious repercussions.
“WHO urges everyone to continue to stay active through the COVID-19 pandemic,” the agency’s head of health promotion Ruediger Krech told reporters.
“If we do not remain active, we run the risk of creating another pandemic of ill-health as a result of sedentary behavior.”
There are still no clear statistics on what impact the pandemic has had on physical activity, but lockdowns, movement restrictions, gym closures, and other measures have clearly forced many people to stay home and have disrupted regular activities and exercise routines.
This is worrying considering that even before the crisis, data shows the vast majority of young people and many adults were not active enough, with dire repercussions for global health.
The WHO estimates that pushing more people to get off the sofa or office chair to move about more could avert up to 5 million deaths each year.
“Being physically active is critical for health and well-being – it can help to add years to life, and life to years,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.
“Every move counts.”
Regular physical activity is key to preventing and helping to manage heart disease, type-2 diabetes, and cancer.
It has also been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, reduce cognitive decline, improve memory, and boost overall brain health.
To reap such benefits, the UN health agency recommends that adults get at least two-and-a-half to 5 hours of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity per week, while children and adolescents should on average move at least an hour a day.
But it warned that its statistics showed that a full quarter of all adults and 80% of adolescents do not meet those targets.
This, it said, is deeply concerning, since sedentary behavior – included in the WHO guidelines for the first time – has been linked to a range of harmful health effects.
Globally, this inactivity is estimated to cost $54 billion in direct health care and another $14 billion in lost productivity each year, the WHO said.
But the good news is that doing any kind of physical activity can counter the negative effects of sitting still for too long.
Krech stressed that the guidelines showed “the benefits of activities you can do every day as part of your everyday life, whether at home, in transit or at work.”
The WHO stressed that living an active life was good for everyone, regardless of their physical ability.
The guidelines encourage women to maintain physical activity throughout pregnancy and post-delivery, and also stress the benefits of physical activity for people living with disabilities.
Older adults were meanwhile advised to add activities that emphasise balance and coordination, as well as muscle strength, to help prevent falls.
“Any duration of physical activity is beneficial. But more is always better,” Krech said.
Fiona Bull, in charge of the WHO’s physical activity unit, said wearable trackers could be a good tool to get people moving more.
“Monitoring how active you are is very good feedback for the individual,” she told reporters, adding that the WHO was looking into ways of making such trackers more globally available.
“We tend to underestimate how much time we spend sedentary.”",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 26, 2020 8:50 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/keeping-indoor-air-clean-can-reduce-the-chance-of-spreading-coronavirus/,Keeping indoor air clean can reduce the chance of spreading coronavirus,"The vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs indoors, mostly from the inhalation of airborne particles that contain the coronavirus. But in spite of the obvious risks posed by being inside, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, small household gatherings are driving much of the recent surge in cases.
The best way to prevent the virus from spreading in a home would be simply to keep infected people away. But this is hard to do when an estimated 40% of cases are asymptomatic and asymptomatic people can still spread the coronavirus to others. Next safest is to entertain outside, but if you can’t, there are a few things you can do to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus.
First – and most important – always wear masks, make sure everyone stays at least 6 feet away from other people and don’t spend too much time indoors. But in addition to these precautions, making sure the air inside is as clean as possible can also help. I am an indoor air quality researcher who studies how to reduce the transmission of airborne infectious diseases. Using increased ventilation or running an appropriately sized air cleaner or filter can add an extra layer of protection.
A safer home is one that constantly has lots of outside air replacing the stale air inside.
Homes are typically ventilated through open windows or doors, or from air leaking in through unintentional openings and cracks in the building itself. A typical air exchange rate for a home is around 0.5 air changes per hour. Because of the complicated way air moves, that translates into taking about two hours to replace two-thirds of the air inside an average home, and about 6 hours to replace all of it.
This slow air exchange is not good when you want to limit the spread of an airborne virus. The higher the ventilation rate the better – so how much fresh air is ideal? While the exact exchange rate depends on the size of a room, as an example, a 10-by-10-foot room with 3 to 4  people inside should have at least 3 air changes an hour. In a pandemic this should be higher, and the World Health Organization recently recommended 6 air changes per hour.
Knowing the exact air exchange rate for your home isn’t necessary; just know that more is better. Thankfully, increasing the ventilation of a house or apartment is easy.
Open as many windows as you can – the larger the opening the better. Open doors to the outside. Run the exhaust fans in your bathroom and above the stove – though only do this if the exhausts go to the outside and if you also have a window or door open. Additionally, you can place fans in open windows and blow the inside air out to even further boost your air flow.
I live in Colorado, and the winter cold has arrived. I still think it is worth it to have windows open, but I open them only about halfway and turn on the heaters in my house. This wastes energy, but I keep the time I have to do this to a minimum, and once visitors leave, I keep the windows open for at least an hour to completely air out the house.
All of these things add up and increase ventilation.
If you are worried that your home ventilation is still too low, air filtration can offer another layer of safety. Much the way an N95 mask works, running air in your home through a filter with small openings can capture airborne particles that could contain the coronavirus.
There are two ways to filter air in a home: using a built-in system – like central heating, for example – or using stand-alone air cleaners.
In my home, we use both air cleaners and our heating system to filter the air. If you have central heating, make sure your furnace filter has a minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) of at least 11. This value describes how effective a filter is at removing airborne particles and contaminants from the recirculated air. The standard on most furnaces is a MERV 8 filter and many furnaces are not capable of running with a more efficient filter, so make sure to check your filter and ask a technician before replacing it. But a MERV 8 filter is better than no filtration at all.
You can also use a stand-alone air cleaner to remove airborne particles, but how effective they are depends on the size of the room. The bigger the room, the more air needs to be cleaned, and stand-alone cleaners are only so powerful. My home has an open floor plan, so I can’t use my air cleaner in the main living space, but it can be helpful in bedrooms or any other smaller enclosed spaces. If you consider buying an air cleaner, I worked with some colleagues at Harvard to build a tool that can be used to determine how powerful an air cleaner you need for different room sizes.
And don’t forget to also consider how effective an air cleaner’s filter is. Your best option is a cleaner that uses a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, as these remove more than 99.97% of all particle sizes.
If you decide to share your home with others in the coming months, remember that being outside is by far the safest. But if you must be inside, shorten the length of time your guests stay, wear masks and socially distance at all times. In addition to these precautions, keeping air flow high by opening windows as wide as possible, driving more air into your home with exhaust fans and using air cleaner and filters can help further reduce the chance of spreading the coronavirus. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/russia-sputnik-v-coronavirus-vaccine-effectiveness/,Russia says Sputnik V virus vaccine 95% effective,"Russia’s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine is 95% effective according to a second interim analysis of clinical trial data, its developers said on Tuesday, November 24.
The two-dose vaccine will be available on international markets for less than $10 (8.40 euros) per dose, they said, and will be free for Russian citizens.
It can be stored at between two and eight degrees Celsius (between 35.6 and 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit), they said, instead of the temperatures below freezing required for some other vaccines.
The calculations of its effectiveness were based on preliminary data obtained 42 days after the first dose, Russia’s health ministry, the state-run Gamaleya research center and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said in a statement.
The statement said that the vaccine had shown 91.4% effectiveness 28 days after the first dose, a figure based on 39 cases.
Forty-two days later, after a second dose, data showed “an efficacy of the vaccine above 95%.”
It did not note the number of coronavirus cases used to make the final calculation, however.
“The second analysis was conducted a week after volunteers got the second dose, meaning that their bodies have partially reacted to both doses,” Gamaleya’s director Alexander Gintsburg said in the statement.
He said the center expects the efficacy rate to be “even higher” 3 weeks after the second dose.
The statement said that 22,000 volunteers had been vaccinated with the first dose and more than 19,000 with both doses.
Overseas trials of the vaccine are also taking place in the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Belarus and other countries.
Russia in August became the first country to register a coronavirus vaccine but did so ahead of the large-scale clinical trials that are still underway.
Last month, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia had registered a second coronavirus vaccine, EpiVacCorona, as a global race heats up in producing an effective vaccine to combat the pandemic, which has now claimed the lives of nearly 1.4 million people.
Putin last week said that Russia had manufacturing agreements in place with China and India and encouraged Brazil and South Africa to also mass produce Russian-made vaccines.
Pharma giants Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their virus vaccine is 95% effective, while US company Moderna said last week early results showed its candidate was 94.5% effective.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 24, 2020 8:32 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/why-the-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-is-global-game-changer-the-conversation/,Why the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is now a global game changer,"In the long dark tunnel that has been 2020, November stands out as the month that light appeared. Some might see it as a bright light, others as a faint light – but it is unmistakably a light.
On November 9, Pfizer announced the interim results of its candidate vaccine, showing it to be “more than 90% effective” in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in late-stage human trials. The news was greeted with joy.
A couple of days later, the Russian Direct Investment Fund announced that the candidate vaccine they are funding – dubbed Sputnik V – showed 92% efficacy in late-stage trials. Not to be outdone, Moderna then announced that its candidate vaccine showed 94.5% efficacy.
The latest COVID-19 vaccine announcement comes from Oxford University. And, as with all of the above announcements, it came via press release. Its vaccine candidate, developed in partnership with AstraZeneca, showed an overall effectiveness of 70.4%.
In case that sounds disappointing, bear in mind that these are interim results and the figures might change. Also, the Oxford vaccine was given to one group of volunteers as two standard doses, which showed 62% effectiveness, and another group of volunteers as a smaller dose followed by a standard second dose. This raised effectiveness to 90%.
It’s not immediately clear why this is the case. Professor Andrew Pollard, one of the lead researchers on the project, described the results as “intriguing”. He also highlighted that the use of lower doses means that there would be more vaccine doses available.
There were no cases of severe COVID-19 in those who received the vaccine. And it seems to generate a protective immune response in older people. Although we’ll have to wait for the final breakdown of results to get clarification on that.
Despite the Oxford vaccine having lower overall effectiveness than the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines – at least at this interim stage – there are other success factors to consider. Safety is one, and the Oxford vaccine is so far reported to have a good safety record with no serious side-effects.
Another crucial factor is storage. The Oxford vaccine can be stored in a domestic fridge. The need for sustained freezing across the whole vaccine journey from factory to clinic at ultra-low temperatures – as seen with the Pfizer vaccine – may be a problem for many countries, but especially poorer countries.
The Oxford vaccine, based on a viral vector, is also cheaper (around US$4) than Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines – around US$20 and $33, respectively. AstraZeneca has made a “no profit pledge”.
As I have previously discussed, equitable distribution of new vaccines is vital, especially for low- and middle-income countries which don’t have the profile or purchasing power of wealthier countries. GAVI – a global health partnership that aims to increase access to immunisation in poor countries – has worked for years to address this very point. It set up the COVAX initiative in 2020, which has access to 700 million doses of COVID vaccine if clinical trials are successful.
Oxford and AstraZeneca have previously made their own commitments to provide a billion doses of their vaccine for low- and middle-income countries, with a commitment to provide 400 million doses before the end of 2020. Certainly, AstraZeneca has committed to provide more doses to countries outside of Europe and the US than any of its nearest competitors.
These commitments will clearly not be enough for immediate global coverage, but it is an excellent start. Around 9% of the world’s population live in extreme poverty, and the health systems around them are fragile. With promises for equitable vaccine distribution, there is hope that the poorer populations around the world will not be forgotten. The global health community must keep its focus on this area.
What does this announcement mean for the world? Potentially a huge amount. But remember that the trials are not yet complete and, at the time of writing, the regulators have yet to approve any of the new vaccine candidates. Even when those hurdles are cleared, we still need to vaccinate the world, which requires successfully navigating the complex obstacles of distance, terrain, politics, cold-chain logistics and human behaviour.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/astrazeneca-promises-virus-vaccine-cost-price-worldwide/,AstraZeneca promises virus vaccine at cost price worldwide,"Hopes of an effective vaccine against coronavirus becoming available rose again on Monday, November 23, with AstraZeneca and Oxford University claiming success with their product, becoming the third team to do so.
The head of AstraZeneca in France, Olivier Nataf, answered questions from AFP in an interview, saying that the data were very encouraging.
Question: The AstraZeneca vaccine is said to be 70% effective, a lower figure than those previously announced by Pfizer and Moderna. Could you explain the data?
The 70% rate is the result of a combined analysis.
Using a regimen of first injecting half a dose of the vaccine and then a full dose a month later the effectiveness was 90%.
Another system, of one full dose first and another a month later the effectiveness is 62%.
This is an interesting lesson: the half-dose plus one dose scheme can become something that we follow, there is an opportunity for availability for the population, where it would take fewer doses to vaccinate more people.
The second point to remember is that there is 100% protection against the occurrence of severe forms of illness and hospitalisations in participants who received the vaccine. And the last point is the confirmation of safety: no serious side effects have been reported, the vaccine is well tolerated in both dosing regimens.
Finally, there is greater simplicity in storage, transport, handling, under normal refrigeration conditions of 2 to 8 degrees. This is a very interesting element from the public health standpoint.
Q: What is your calendar for rolling out the vaccine to the public?
We will be producing 3 billion doses worldwide in 2021.
Parallel and independent supply chains were set up very early on: in the United States, in several European countries, and in the rest of the world.
Production is underway. We have announced the first agreements with various governments and non-governmental organizations.
It will be possible to provide the vaccine as soon as the final results of clinical trials, and especially the evaluations by health authorities, are available.
Production is ramping up, there are already 50 million doses of active substances available and capacity is being increased almost weekly.
Q: AstraZeneca has said that the vaccine will be made available at cost price. This is a different strategy from some of your competitors. What’s the thinking behind your strategy?
It’s more than a strategy, it’s a commitment.
The price is around 2.50 euros ($3) per dose. This is the main subject of our agreement with Oxford, in order to be able to provide this vaccine to the widest possible population, under the most equitable conditions of access possible.
We are committed to these 3 billion doses at cost price for 2021. We must not forget that this is a race against the virus rather than a race for the vaccine between competitors.
As an industrialist, I hear this a lot, but in fact there are a lot of collaborations in this race against the virus: Pfizer has partnered with BioNtech, Sanofi with GSK, AstraZeneca with the University of Oxford.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 24, 2020 9:49 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/astrazeneca-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-announcement/,AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine 70% effective at tackling coronavirus,"A coronavirus vaccine developed by drug firm AstraZeneca and Oxford University has shown 70% effectiveness in trials involving 23,000 people, they said in a statement on Monday, November 23.
The announcement comes after other trials of drugs developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna announced effectiveness above 90%.
The results ranged between 62% and 90% efficacy depending on the vaccine dosage, according to Monday’s statement.
AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot said his firm’s vaccine would still be highly effective and would have an “immediate impact.”
The firm said it would look to develop up to 3 billion doses of the vaccine in 2021 if it passes the remaining regulatory hurdles.
While the drug showed 90% when given as a half-dose followed by a full-dose at least one month apart, the result was 62% when given as two full doses over the same time period.
“The combined analysis… resulted in an average efficacy of 70 percent,” it said.
It said the vaccine could be stored, transported and handled “at normal refrigerated conditions” of between two and eight degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 6 months.
More than 23,000 adults are currently being assessed in the trials, with the number expected to rise to up to 60,000, the statement said.
Early results suggested there were 131 cases of COVID-19 among the participants but none was serious.
Tests are being carried out also in the United States, Japan, Russia, South Africa, Kenya and Latin America, with trials planned also in other European and Asian countries.
Oxford professor Andrew Pollard said the latest findings suggested the drug was “an effective vaccine that will save many lives.”
“Excitingly, we’ve found that one of our dosing regimens may be around 90 percent effective and if this dosing regime is used, more people could be vaccinated with planned vaccine supply,” said Pollard, who is chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial.
“Today’s announcement is only possible thanks to the many volunteers in our trial, and the  hard working and talented team of researchers based around the world.”
US biotech giant Pfizer and German partner BioNTech have sought approval to roll out their coronavirus vaccine early, a first step towards relief as surging infections prompt a return to shutdowns that traumatised nations and the global economy earlier this year.
G20 leaders on Sunday said they would “spare no effort” to ensure the fair distribution of coronavirus vaccines worldwide and support poor countries, whose economies have been ravaged by the crisis.

https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/united-states-expects-begin-coronavirus-vaccinations-early-december/,US expects to begin COVID-19 vaccinations in early December,"The United States hopes to begin a sweeping program of COVID-19 vaccinations in early December, the head of the government coronavirus vaccine effort said Sunday, November 22, as cases surge across the worst-hit nation.
The beginning of vaccinations could be a crucial turning point in the battle against the virus that has claimed more than 255,000 lives in the US, the world’s highest reported toll, since emerging from China late last year.
“Our plan is to be able to ship vaccines to the immunization sites within 24 hours of approval” by the US Food and Drug Administration, Moncef Slaoui told CNN, pointing to possible dates of December 11-12. (READ: COVID-19 vaccine: The next steps)
FDA vaccine advisors reportedly will meet December 10 to discuss approving vaccines which pharmaceutical firms Pfizer and Moderna say are at least 95% effective.
Worldwide, nearly 1.4 million people have died this year and at least 58 million cases have been registered.
Slaoui estimated that 20 million people across the US could be vaccinated in December, with 30 million per month after that.
He said that by May, with potentially 70% of the population having been vaccinated, the country could attain “herd immunity,” meaning the virus can no longer spread widely – and that people can move closer to resuming their pre-coronavirus way of life.
But Slaoui added a note of caution, saying, “I really hope and look forward to seeing that the level of negative perception of the vaccine decreases and people’s acceptance increase.
“That is going to be critical to help us.”
A recent Gallup poll showed that four in 10 Americans still say they would not get a COVID-19 vaccine, though that is down slightly from 5 in 10 surveyed in September.
Slaoui said he thought it would help in persuading vaccine skeptics to learn that trials have shown the new vaccines to be 95% effective – well above the 50% level that an earlier target for vaccine approval.
Officials have yet to announce which groups in the population would receive the vaccine first, though healthcare workers are certain to receive priority, followed by vulnerable groups like the elderly.
Slaoui said that while the trials had ensured only short-term safety, decades of experience showed that nearly all adverse effects of vaccines occurred within 40 days of being administered, while the current trials protectively covered 60 days.
With the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Slaoui added, there were no serious adverse effects in that period.
For now, the vaccines have not been tested on young children, but the doctor said trials are underway, with a chance toddlers could be vaccinated starting in the 2nd quarter of 2021, with infants coming afterward.
Countries worldwide, as well as international organizations, were working out plans for global distribution of these vaccines and potentially others still being developed.
The G20 countries, in a virtual meeting hosted by Saudi Arabia, plan to pledge to “spare no effort” in ensuring fair distribution of coronavirus vaccines worldwide, according to a draft communique seen by Agence France-Presse on Sunday.
The communique offered no details, however, on how the effort would be funded.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 22, 2020 10:49 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-vaccines-developed-record-time-safety/,COVID-19 vaccines were developed in record time – but are these game-changers safe?,"There are now two COVID-19 vaccines that, at least according to preliminary reports, appear to be 94.5% and 95% effective. Both were developed in a record-breaking 11 months or so.
I am an infectious diseases specialist and professor at the University of Virginia. I care for patients with COVID-19 and am conducting the local site for a phase 3 clinical trial of Regeneron’s antibody cocktail as a tool to prevent household transmission of COVID-19. I’m also conducting research on how dysregulation of the immune system during SARS-CoV-2 infection causes lung damage.
Despite the vaccines’ relatively rapid development, the normal safety testing protocols are still in place.
Vaccines typically take at least a decade to develop, test and manufacture. Both the chickenpox vaccine and FluMist, which protects against several strains of the influenza virus, took 28 years to develop. It took 15 years to develop a vaccine for human papilloma virus, which can cause six kinds of cancer. It also took 15 years to develop a vaccine for rotavirus, which commonly causes severe, watery diarrhea. It took Jonas Salk six years to develop and test the first polio vaccine, starting with the isolation of the virus.
The Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccines, by contrast, have been developed in less than a year. That’s a game-changer.
The mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna are faster to develop as they do not require companies to produce protein or weakened pathogen for the vaccine.
Traditional vaccines typically use a weakened version of the pathogen or a protein piece of it, but because these are grown in eggs or cells, developing and manufacturing vaccines takes a long time. By contrast, by using just the genetic material that makes the Spike glycoprotein – the protein on the surface of the coronavirus that is essential for infecting human cells – the design and manufacture of the vaccine is simplified.
The genetic material mRNA is easy to make in a laboratory. Manufacturing an mRNA vaccine rather than a protein vaccine can save months, if not years.
Another factor that accelerated vaccine development was the swift and efficient recruitment of patients for clinical trials.
Safety is the first and foremost goal for a vaccine.
In my opinion, safety is not compromised by the speed of vaccine development and emergency use authorization. The reason that vaccines may be approved so quickly is that the large clinical trials to assess vaccine efficacy and safety are happening at the same time as the large-scale manufacturing preparation, funded by the federal government’s Operation Warp Speed program.
Typically, large-scale manufacturing begins only once the vaccine has been tested in clinical trials. In the case of COVID-19, the U.S. government wanted to be ready to begin distributing the vaccine the moment the results of the phase 3 trials were known and the safety data had been analyzed.
To this end, the pharmaceutical companies launched at-risk manufacturing – which means that the manufactured vaccine doses would be thrown away if the vaccine was ineffective or unsafe – during the FDA-mandated two-month safety waiting period.
The upside is that if the vaccine is safe and effective, it can be distributed immediately, and vaccination can begin.
No mRNA vaccines have been approved before because it is relatively new technology.
But these mRNA vaccines appear safe and no riskier than other tried and tested ones, like the childhood measles vaccine. To date, no significant side effects have been reported in the interim phase 3 studies of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.
Side effects that have been reported are minor things that one would expect with any vaccine, including soreness at the site of injection and transient fatigue, muscle or joint aches.
EUA stands for emergency use authorization.
Under EUA, the FDA is requiring that a COVID-19 vaccine be at least 50% effective at preventing symptomatic illness.
It is also requiring a median of two months of follow-up after completion of the vaccination for half of the vaccine recipients (for most of the vaccines this is two doses). This two-month period is to allow detection of an adverse event from the vaccine. – The Conversation/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-vaccine-the-next-steps/,COVID-19 vaccine: The next steps,"With US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech applying for an emergency use authorization in the United States for their coronavirus vaccine and US biotech company Moderna expected to do so soon, here are the next steps in the approval and distribution process:
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will immediately begin evaluating the results of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials conducted by Pfizer/BioNTech.
They will concentrate on the safety of the vaccine and its effectiveness, which has been billed at 95 percent by Pfizer/BioNTech.
FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said the approval process will include a public meeting of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, which includes experts in infectious diseases, pediatrics, biostatistics and industry representatives.
The committee’s recommendations are not binding, however, and a final decision on whether or not to authorize the vaccine will be up to the scientists at the FDA.
The FDA could provide emergency authorization as soon as the first two weeks of December, according to Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientist for “Operation Warp Speed,” the US government initiative to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.
It would be a conditional approval in the context of the global health crisis and would restrict distribution of the vaccine to certain members of the population.
Children, for example, would not be included because Pfizer has not yet conducted widespread testing of the vaccine among those under the age of 18.
Another US government agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), would determine the order of priority for distribution of the vaccine.
Front-line medical workers and elderly residents of nursing homes would probably be among the first to be inoculated.
In Europe, Britain, Canada, Japan and Australia, the process is slightly different and regulators there have been constantly reviewing the data from clinical trials being conducted by several manufacturers.
The European Union could give a green light to a vaccine as early as the second half of December, according to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.
Pfizer/BioNTech said doses of the vaccine would be ready for distribution “within hours” after US authorization, which could mean shipments beginning in the second half of December.
They would initially be provided by a US factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and a Belgian plant in Puurs.
The vaccine must be stored at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit), temperatures much colder than those of a standard freezer.
Pfizer would distribute the doses to vaccination centers in containers filled with dry ice which should keep the vaccine at the required temperature for 15 days.
The Moderna Covid-19 vaccine could be ready for distribution soon after that of Pfizer/BioNTech and could be followed by February by that of Johnson & Johnson, according to Slaoui, with AstraZeneca/Oxford also expected in the next few months.
While high-risk groups will be the first vaccinated, the US government hopes that there will be enough vaccines by April 2021 to offer it to the broader population and provide high coverage by the summer.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 21, 2020 8:41 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/virus-infection-creates-immunity-at-least-6-months-study/,Virus infection creates immunity for at least 6 months – study,"Individuals infected with coronavirus are unlikely to catch the illness again for at least 6 months, researchers at the University of Oxford said Friday, November 20.
The finding comes as part of a large-scale study into COVID-19 reinfection after observations from healthcare professionals that the phenomenon was relatively rare.
Oxford University Professor David Eyre, one of the authors of the study, said the findings were “really good news”.
“We can be confident that, at least in the short term, most people who get COVID-19 won’t get it again,” he said.
The authors highlighted they had not yet gathered enough data to make a judgement on reinfection after 6 months.
However, the ongoing study has an end goal of verifying how long protection from reinfection lasts in total.
The director of infection prevention and control at study partners Oxford University Hospitals (OUH), Katie Jeffery, called the finding “exciting”.
It indicated “that infection with the virus provides at least short-term protection from reinfection,” she added.
US biotech firm Moderna announced this week its vaccine candidate was nearly 95% effective in a trial – a week after similar results were announced by pharma giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.
The Oxford study into reinfection drew on data from regular coronavirus testing of 12,180 health care workers at OUH over a period of 30 weeks.
It found that none of the 1,246 staff with coronavirus antibodies developed a symptomatic infection.
Three members of staff with antibodies did test positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 but were all well and did not develop symptoms.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 20, 2020 11:27 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-biontech-seek-emergency-approval-virus-vaccine-november-2020/,"Pfizer, BioNTech seek first vaccine approval in US","US biotech giant Pfizer and German partner BioNTech sought approval on Friday, November 20, to roll out their coronavirus vaccine early, a first step towards relief as surging infections prompt a return to shutdowns that traumatized nations and the global economy earlier this year.
The world is looking to scientists for salvation from the global pandemic, as a new wave of infections forces New York to shut schools and California to implement night time curfews.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said its vaccines committee would meet on December 10 to discuss the request for emergency use authorization.
“The FDA recognizes that transparency and dialogue are critical for the public to have confidence in COVID-19 vaccines,” the organization’s head Stephen Hahn said in a statement.
“I want to assure the American people that the FDA’s process and evaluation of the data for a potential COVID-19 vaccine will be as open and transparent as possible.”
He said he could not predict how long the review would take but the federal government said earlier the final green light would probably come in December.
“Filing in the US represents a critical milestone in our journey to deliver a COVID-19 vaccine to the world,” Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla said.
The BioNTech/Pfizer shot and another one being developed by the US firm Moderna have taken the lead in the global chase for a vaccine.
EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the European bloc could also approve both before the end of the year.
But the vexed and enormously complex question of how to expedite production and distribution means there will be no immediate reprieve.
And the latest wave of the pandemic is hitting many regions harder than the first that swept the globe after the virus emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.
Worldwide deaths are approaching 1.4 million and infections nearing 57 million – although the true numbers are unknown since countries have different reporting methods and many cases go undetected.
India’s infections have surpassed 9 million – second only to the United States – and some of its graveyards have been running out of room.
“Initially when the virus broke (out), I thought I’ll bury 100-200 people and it’ll be done. But the current situation is beyond my wildest thoughts,” New Delhi gravedigger Mohammed Shamim told AFP.
And Mexico became the fourth country to see its death toll breach 100,000.
“We’re at a point where we don’t see a clear phase of descent,” former Mexican health ministry official Malaquias Lopez told AFP.
Current US numbers – more than quarter of a million deaths have been reported with 2,200 registered just on Thursday – have alarmed authorities enough to advise that people stay at home for next week’s Thanksgiving holiday, when Americans usually travel from coast to coast to be with their families.
Not everyone is happy about the new guidelines and regulations.
More than 13,000 people have signed an online “Keep NYC Schools Open” petition which calls the city’s decision to close schools for its 1.1 million students but leave open its bars and gyms “nonsensical.”
California will also impose a 10:00 pm to 5:00 am curfew from Saturday – a measure that mirrors one that Istanbul will start imposing for its 15 million residents on weekends starting Friday night.
Canada’s largest city Toronto and much of its suburbs will be placed under a new lockdown beginning Monday.
And the latest restrictions in Europe include Northern Ireland’s decision to shut pubs and shops for an extra two weeks, as Portugal extends a state of emergency until December 8.
But health officials in France said 3 weeks of restrictions appeared to have helped.
“Although indicators are still at high levels, they suggest that the peak of the second wave is behind us,” the country’s health agency said.
Governments are now pinning their hopes on a vaccine that can save them from business and school closures and the stay-at-home orders that put people’s mental health under severe strain.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he hoped to get “a very substantial part” of the nation of 47 million people vaccinated by mid-2021, while the Netherlands said they were ready to roll vaccines out to some 3.5 million people in the first quarter of the year.
The British government said it had asked its independent medicines regulator to study Pfizer/BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine with a view to an imminent rollout.
A separate candidate vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca has been shown to be safe and effective in a smaller study of older adults, and is now in a phase 3 trial.
But developing countries will face deeper challenges. The World Health Organization has called on G20 nations to help plug a $4.5 billion funding gap for a program to distribute vaccines globally, according to a letter seen by the Agence France-Presse.
And the unprecedented speed at which the vaccines are being developed has raised some alarm.
China’s Sinopharm revealed Friday that it has already given its experimental vaccine to nearly a million people — including state employees and students heading to study abroad.
Top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci has sought to dispel concerns about the candidates from Pfizer and Moderna, saying the speed at which they were developed “did not compromise safety” but was a “reflection of the extraordinary scientific advances in these types of vaccines.”",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 20, 2020 9:12 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/superspreader-events-key-driver-covid-19-pandemic/,Superspreader events key driver in COVID-19 pandemic,"At churches, on cruise ships, and even in the White House, superspreading events that can sicken dozens, even hundreds, of people have illustrated the potential for the coronavirus to infect in dramatic bursts.
Experts say these large clusters are more than just extreme outliers, but rather the pandemic’s likely main engine of transmission.
And understanding where, when, and why they happen could help us tame the spread of the virus in the period before a vaccine may be widely available.
Research increasingly suggests that the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 does not fan out evenly across the population, but spreads at the extremes in an almost “all or nothing” pattern.
Many studies now suggest the majority of people with COVID-19 barely pass it on to anyone else, but when infections happen they can be explosive and supercharge an outbreak.
Then the virus can infect “10, 20, 50, or even more people”, said Benjamin Althouse, research scientist at the University of Washington’s Institute for Disease Modeling.
This corresponds to the “80/20 rule” of epidemiology, where 80% of cases come from only 20% of those infected, but Althouse said this coronavirus may be even more extreme, with 90% of cases coming from potentially just 10% of carriers.
This transmission pattern is like “throwing matches on a pile of kindling,” he told AFP.
“You throw one match, it doesn’t ignite. You throw another match, it doesn’t ignite. You throw yet another match, and this time you see flames blaze up,” he said.
“For SARS-CoV-2, this means that while it is difficult to establish in new places, once established, it can spread rapidly and far.”
Superspreading events have grabbed headlines, looming large in the narrative of the unfolding pandemic.
In February, the Diamond Princess and its 4,000 passengers spent weeks in quarantine at port in Japan as the number of infections on board climbed, reaching 700.
The same month a 61-year-old woman, known as “Patient 31,” attended several church services of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the South Korean city of Daegu.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has since linked more than 5,000 infections to Shincheonji.
More recently the virus managed to infiltrate the White House despite a host of measures to keep it out.
Political gatherings, business conferences, and sports tournaments have all acted as infection incubators, but these high profile events could just be the tip of the iceberg.
A study by US researchers, based on one of the world’s largest contact tracing operations and published in Science in September, found that “superspreading predominated” in transmission.
Analyzing data from the first 4 months of the pandemic in the states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in India, the authors found that just 8% of infected individuals accounted for 60% of new cases, while 71% of people with the virus did not pass it on to any of their contacts.
Perhaps this should not be a surprise.
Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the heart of the World Health Organization’s pandemic response, tweeted in October that “superspreading is a hallmark” of coronaviruses.
Indeed, it has been observed in many infectious diseases.
One of the most famous superspreaders was Mary Mallon, a cook working in New York in the early 1900s who was the first documented healthy carrier of typhoid bacteria in the US.
Blamed for giving the illness to dozens of people, she was given the unsympathetic label “Typhoid Mary” and forcibly confined for years.
Measles, smallpox, and Ebola also see clustering patterns, as did the other coronaviruses, SARS, and MERS.
Early in the pandemic, much attention was focused on the basic reproduction number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2.
This helps calculate the speed a disease can spread by looking at the average number of others a person with the virus infects.
But looking at transmission through this metric alone often “fails to tell the whole story,” said Althouse, who co-authored a paper on the limitations of R0 in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface this month.
For instance, he said Ebola, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza, all have an R0 value of around two to 3
But while people with the flu tend to infect two or 3 others “consistently,” the transmission pattern for those with Ebola and SARS-CoV-2 is overdispersed, meaning most will hardly spread it and some will give rise to tens of other cases.
A different metric – “k” – is used to capture this clustering behaviour, although it usually requires “more detailed data and methodology,” said Akira Endo, a research student at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
His modeling from the early international spread of the virus, published in Wellcome Open Research, suggested SARS-CoV-2 could be highly overdispersed.
A telltale clue, he said, was that some countries reported numerous imported cases but no signs of sustained transmission – like the match analogy – while others reported large local outbreaks with only a few imported cases.
But even k may not give the full picture, said Felix Wong, a postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
His research analysing known COVID-19 superspreading events, published this month in the journal PNAS, found that they were happening even more frequently than predicted by traditional epidemiological models.
They are “extreme, yet probable occurrences,” Wong told AFP.
So why does superspreading occur?
We don’t know definitively whether biological factors, such as viral load, play much of a role.
But what we do know is people can spread SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms and given a poorly-ventilated, crowded space – particularly where people talk, shout, or sing – the virus can run rampant.
This could be why a study in Nature this month found that restaurants, gyms, and cafes account for most COVID-19 infections in the United States.
Using the mobile phone data of 98 million people, researchers found about 10% of venues accounted for over 80% of cases.
Given this, experts say the focus should be on these types of spaces – and reducing opportunities for the virus to access large numbers of people.
Wong said his modeling showed that if each individual was limited to 10 transmissible contacts, “viral transmission would quickly die down.”
Overdispersed spread also means that most people testing positive for the virus are likely to be part of a cluster.
This opens up another way to trace infections: backwards.
“The idea being that it could be more efficient to trace back, and isolate, superspreaders than it is to trace downstream and isolate individuals who, even if they were infected, might transmit the virus to very few people,” said Wong.
Both Japan and South Korea have used backwards contact tracing, which has been credited with helping them curb their epidemics, along with other control measures.
Masks, social distancing, and reducing contacts are all ways to limit transmission opportunities, Althouse said, adding that even characterizing people as “superspreaders” is misleading.
“There are vast differences in biology between individuals – I may have a million times more virus in my nose than you – but if I am a recluse, I can infect no one,” he said.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 20, 2020 12:00 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-advises-against-remdesivir-coronavirus-treatment/,WHO advises against remdesivir for coronavirus treatment,"The anti-viral drug remdesivir should not be used to treat COVID-19 patients no matter how severe their illness as it has “no important effect” on survival chances, the World Health Organization said Friday, November 20.
Scratching one of the few treatments that had shown some initial promise in severe patients, a WHO Guideline Development Group (GDG) of international experts said there was “no evidence based on currently available data that it does improve patient-important outcomes.”
The United States, the European Union, and other countries have granted temporary approval for the use of remdesivir after initial research showed it may shorten recovery time in some coronavirus patients.
President Donald Trump was treated with remdesivir among other medicines after he tested positive for COVID-19 in October.
Friday’s WHO recommendation was based on 4 international randomized trials among more than 7,000 patients hospitalized with the virus.
Publishing updated treatment guidance in the BMJ medical journal, the panel acknowledged that their recommendation does not mean that remdesivir has no benefit for patients.
But based on the latest figures, costs, and delivery methods, it advised “against administering remdesivir in addition to usual care for the treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, regardless of disease severity.”
Manufacturer Gilead said last month that the drug had boosted 2020 third quarter sales by almost $900 million.
Initially developed as a treatment for the Ebola virus, remdesivir was found in one study published in May to reduce the length of hospital stays for COVID-19 sufferers from 15 to 11 days on average.
A subsequent WHO pre-print however found the drug “appeared to have little or no effect” on mortality or length of hospitalization among more than 11,000 hospitalized patients across 30 countries.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 20, 2020 9:32 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/oxford-coronavirus-vaccine-safe-older-adults-results/,Oxford COVID-19 vaccine safe for older adults – results,"A leading COVID-19 vaccine candidate has shown to safely produce a robust immune response in healthy older adults, its British makers said Thursday, November 19, as it released its phase 2 trial results.
The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, produced fewer side effects in people aged 56 and over than in younger people – a significant finding given that COVID-19 disproportionately causes severe illness among seniors.
The manufacturers said the vaccine was undergoing larger, more comprehensive phase 3 trials to confirm the results.
Immune responses from vaccines tend to lessen as people get older as the immune system gradually slows with age.
This leaves older adults more vulnerable to infection from a variety of illnesses.
“As a result, it is crucial that COVID-19 vaccines are tested in this group who are also a priority group for immunization,” Andre Pollard, an Oxford professor and lead author of the study results, published in The Lancet.
The phase 2 trial saw 560 participants, 240 of whom were over 70, split into groups that received either one or two doses of the vaccine, or a placebo.
They had their immune responses assessed on the day of the vaccination, then several more times over the coming weeks.
Responses were “similar” across all age groups, the researchers said.
“The research shows that an immune response was generated in all age groups, including in the cohort of participants aged over 70 years,” said Michael Head, senior research fellow in Global Health at the University of Southampton, who was not involved in the trial.
“Since elderly populations will be one of the priority groups to receive a vaccine when one is available, this is good news.”
The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is one of 48 that are undergoing human trials against COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization.
This month Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna announced the results of phase 3 trials – which are much larger than phase 2 and normally include tens of thousands of subjects – that suggested both vaccine candidates were effective in preventing COVID-19.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 19, 2020 6:42 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/virus-wave-must-be-fought-without-vaccines/,Virus wave must be fought without vaccines – WHO,"The World Health Organization’s emergencies director warned Wednesday, November 18, that vaccines would not arrive in time to defeat the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The WHO’s Michael Ryan said vaccines should not be seen as a “unicorn” magic solution – and countries battling a resurgence of the virus would once again have to “climb this mountain” without them.
“I think it’s at least 4 to 6 months before we have significant levels of vaccination going on anywhere,” he said, during a public question and answer session live on social media.
Despite recent promising announcements from final-phase candidate vaccine trials, “We’re not there with vaccines yet,” said Ryan.
“Many countries are going through this wave, and they’re going to go through this wave, and continue through this wave, without vaccines.
“We need to understand and internalize that, and realize: we have got to climb this mountain this time, without vaccines.”
Pfizer said Wednesday that a completed study of its experimental vaccine showed it was 95% effective, while fellow US firm Moderna said this week that its own candidate was 94.5% effective. Russia claims its candidate is more than 90% effective.
Ryan warned against slackening off individual vigilance against the virus in the mistaken belief that vaccines would now solve the problem instead.
“Some people think a vaccine will be, in a sense, the solution: the unicorn we’ve all been chasing. It’s not,” the Irishman said.
“If we add vaccines and forget the other things, COVID does not go to zero.”
The number of new COVID-19 cases in Europe declined last week for the first time in over 3 months, but deaths in the region continued to climb, WHO data showed Wednesday.
While at least 55.6 million cases worldwide have been registered since the outbreak emerged in China last December, the novel coronavirus has killed more than 1.3 million people around the globe, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.
Ryan voiced concerns about how the pandemic has left many bereaved grandchildren who have been unable to go through the normal grieving process due to the restrictions imposed to combat the virus.
“A lot of kids in this have lost grandparents,” he said.
“There’s quite a bit of trauma out there amongst kids.
“The grieving process for kids – it’s tough, because you don’t have all the natural things: the funeral situation, you don’t get to say goodbye, you don’t have the gatherings, so it’s grieving interrupted.
“I am concerned if the child’s need to grieve the loss of a grandparent has been interrupted, because that has a lifelong impact.”",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 19, 2020 10:47 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-95-percent-effective-november-18-2020/,"Pfizer, BioNTech say results show COVID-19 vaccine 95% effective","Pfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday, November 18, a completed analysis of their experimental COVID-19 vaccine found it protected 95% of people against the disease and announced they were applying for US emergency approval “within days.”
The US pharmaceutical company and its German partner brought further hope to a world upended by the coronavirus pandemic with the announcement, which follows one last week when they said a preliminary analysis showed the product was 90% effective.
Adding to the encouraging data was that the efficacy was found to be consistent across all age-groups – a primary concern for a disease that hits the elderly the hardest – as well as genders and ethnicities.
“The study results mark an important step in this historic eight-month journey to bring forward a vaccine capable of helping to end this devastating pandemic,” said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.
“With hundreds of thousands of people around the globe infected every day, we urgently need to get a safe and effective vaccine to the world,” he added.
Wednesday’s news came after 170 people fell sick in an ongoing clinical trial of almost 44,000 people – 162 of whom were in a placebo group and 8 of whom received the two-dose medicine.
Out of the 170 patients who became sick, 10 developed severe COVID-19 – 9 in the placebo group and one in the vaccine group.
The new data showed the vaccine was generally well tolerated, with most side-effects short-lived and either mild or moderate.
About 4% experienced severe fatigue and 2% got severe headaches after their second dose.
Older patients had fewer and milder side-effects.
The preliminary analysis announced last week had been based on data from 94 sick people, and the companies say the additional patients have now given them a more complete picture.
The ongoing late-stage trial is taking place at 150 global sites in the US, Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina.
The trial will continue for another two years to find out how long immunity lasts and whether there are longer term safety issues.
If the FDA issues an emergency use authorization, the vaccine could start reaching the first Americans – frontline workers, the elderly and other high-risk people – in the first half of December.
The US has said it expects it to be available to the general population by April.
Pfizer and BioNTech said they expect to produce 50 million doses this year and 1.3 billion by the end of 2021.
On Monday, November 16, US biotech firm Moderna said the two-dose vaccine it developed with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) was 94.5% effective, according to a preliminary analysis.
Both vaccines use mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) technology to deliver genetic material to the body that makes human cells create a protein from the virus.
This trains the immune system to be ready to attack if it encounters SARS-CoV-2.
No mRNA vaccines have ever been approved, but Anthony Fauci, the scientist who led the NIH effort, told Agence France-Presse Tuesday, November 17, the technology had now “established itself.”
But there are also important differences between the two.
For one, the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius (- 94 degrees Fahrenheit) while the Moderna vaccine only needs -20 degrees Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit), more akin to a regular freezer.
This has to do with having different formulations of “lipid nanoparticles” used to deliver the mRNA molecule.
The deep-freezer conditions needed for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have raised concerns, which the companies tried to address Wednesday.
They said they had developed “specially designed, temperature-controlled thermal shippers utilizing dry ice to maintain temperature conditions” which can be used for up to 15 days by refilling with dry case.
Each container would have a GPS thermal sensor to track location and temperature as it makes its way across the world.
On the other hand, the Pfizer-BioNTech doses are much smaller – 30 micrograms to Moderna-NIH’s 100 micrograms – probably lowering production costs per dose.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 18, 2020 8:30 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/study-diet-trends-4-billion-people-overweight-2050/,Diet trends to see 4 billion people overweight by 2050 – study,"More than 4 billion people could be overweight by 2050, with 1.5 billion of them obese, if the current global dietary trend towards processed foods continues, a first-of-its-kind study predicted Wednesday, November 18.
Warning of a health and environmental crisis of “mind-blowing magnitude,” experts from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) said that global food demand would leap 50% by mid-century, pushing past Earth’s capacity to sustain nature.
Food production already hoovers up three-quarters of the world’s fresh water and one-third of its land – and accounts for up to a third of greenhouse gas emissions.
Providing a long-term overview of changing global eating habits between 1965 and 2100, the researchers used an open-source model to forecast how food demand would respond to a variety of factors such as population growth, aging, growing body masses, declining physical activity and increased food waste.
They found that “business as usual” – a continuation of current trends – will likely see more than 4 billion people, or 45% of the world’s population, overweight by 2050.
The model predicted that 16% would be obese, compared with 9% currently among the 29% of the population who are overweight.
“The increasing waste of food and the rising consumption of animal protein mean that the environmental impact of our agricultural system will spiral out of control,” said Benjamin Bodirsky, lead author of the study published in Nature Scientific Reports.
“Whether greenhouse gasses, nitrogen pollution or deforestation: we are pushing the limits of our planet – and exceeding them.”
While trends vary between regions, the authors said that global eating habits were moving away from plant- and starch-based diets to more “affluent diets high in sugar, fat, and animal-source foods, featuring highly-processed food products.”
At the same time, the study found that as a result of increasing inequality along with food waste and loss – food that is produced but not consumed due to lack of storage or overbuying – around half a billion people will still be undernourished by mid-century.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/can-surgical-masks-be-reused/,Can surgical masks be reused?,"Health authorities say the most widespread anti-COVID weapon – surgical masks – must be thrown away after a single use, but environmental concerns are pushing some scientists to question this recommendation.
As the coronavirus continues to spread, masks have in many places become mandatory on public transport, in shops, and at work.
But cost has become an issue, as has the fact so many disposable plastic masks wind up in waterways and the oceans.
One alternative is reusable cloth masks, but many people prefer single-use surgical masks because they are lighter and individually cheaper.
“Medical masks are for single use only,” the World Health Organization has said. “Discard the mask immediately, preferably into a closed bin.”
But faced with shortages during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in March and April, the WHO allowed in a June report for “exceptional procedures” to disinfect throw-away masks for reuse.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends – in emergency circumstances – hydrogen peroxide vapor to decontaminate the N95 masks worn by healthcare workers.
Other methods to purify single-use masks include exposing them to high temperatures or ultraviolet radiation.
But these methods are inconvenient for people at home, said French microbiologist and member of Adios Corona, Denis Corpet.
Adios Corona – a group of scientists who provide information on COVID-19 to the public – recommends “placing the mask in a paper envelope with the date clearly marked, and leaving it for seven days.”
“Several scientific studies show that viruses are almost all dead on a mask after 7 days,” said Corpet.
A study published in The Lancet found that only 0.1% of the virus on the outside surface of the mask was still detectable after one week.
This method, however, is not appropriate for healthcare workers exposed to high viral loads.
Peter Tsai, the inventor of N95 electrostatically charged filter material, agrees with the seven-day method.
But he suggests leaving used masks out in the open for a week before reuse, a cycle he says can be repeated 5 to 10 times.
Disposable masks can also be placed in the oven, Tsai told AFP, ideally at a temperature between 70 and 75 degrees Celsius (158 and 167 degrees Fahrenheit) – not too high to avoid burning the plastic, but sufficiently hot to kill the virus.
Washing masks in a washing machine, however, is not a good idea.
“Washing without detergent may not wash away the virus,” Tsai said. “And washing with detergent will erase the (electrostatic) charges,” diminishing its efficiency.
French consumers’ rights group UFC-Que Choisir washed surgical masks at 60C, put them in the dryer, and ironed them. After 10 such cycles, the masks still filtered at least 90% of 3-micron particles.
“Apart from a slight felting, the washed surgical masks were at least as efficient as the best cloth masks,” UFC-Que Choisir reported last week.
Researcher Philippe Vroman from French engineering university Ensait came to the same conclusion.
After 5 washes, “there are practically no differences (of filtration) for particles of 3 microns,” Vroman said, on the basis of preliminary results not yet published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.
“And I would rather we swap masks every 4 hours and wash them, rather than wearing them several days in a row as some people do. It’s a bit like underwear,” he said.
But not all scientists agree.
“Washing the mask at home could potentially cause a secondary contamination and spread the virus if washing is not set appropriately,” said Kaiming Ye, head of the biomedical engineering department at New York’s Binghamton University.
Until more research is published on the matter, official advice from health authorities is not set to change.
“Single-use surgical masks must be thrown into the bin after use,” said France’s health authority DGS, but noted that more studies were underway.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 18, 2020 10:53 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/what-is-it-like-vaccine-trial/,What is it like to take part in a vaccine trial?,"A key facet of the global mad scramble by Pfizer, Moderna, and other pharma groups to develop a viable coronavirus vaccine is the recruitment of tens of thousands of volunteers willing to participate in clinical trials.
AFP’s correspondent in Miami, Leila Macor, took part in such a trial organized by US biotech firm Moderna, which announced Monday, November 16, that its experimental vaccine was nearly 95% effective.
Why did Macor, who suffers from asthma, decide to be one of Moderna’s 30,000 test subjects? Here, she recounts her experience, which began just weeks after her own father died of COVID-19 in Chile.
Three weeks before Pfizer and Moderna launched their coronavirus vaccine clinical trials in late July, my father passed away – alone, as so many have in this crisis.
As our family lived through the trauma, and said goodbye as best we could, I was confronting another stark and dangerous reality – Miami was becoming a major US virus hotspot, and my job was to cover the story.
But my life has been irrevocably changed. I lost my dad, and I have asthma, which could lead to serious complications if I were to be infected.
The idea of taking action to help bring this deadly medical emergency under control offered me some inner peace.
Let me be clear, this was a totally personal decision that had nothing to do with work.
I talked it over with friends and family, who helped me decide that any possible side effects from the trial would not be worse than getting COVID-19.
So I took the plunge.
Two days after writing a story about the start of phase 3 trials in Florida, I once again knocked on the door of a lab – this time as a potential subject.
Research Centers of America, located in the Miami suburb of Hollywood, was working on trials for Pfizer and Moderna, alternating every other day.
Dozens of other labs were recruiting volunteers across the United States. Anyone was eligible, as long as they were in high-risk jobs: doctors, taxi drivers, grocery store workers…and reporters.
I made an appointment for a Tuesday in mid-August. That happened to be a Moderna day.
Lab staff put a name tag on me and brought me to an office, where they explained what would happen. They also gave me a 22-page document with all the details.
The trial consists of two doses. Volunteers are paid $2,400 over the course of the two-year study. They warned of possible side effects – from pain at the injection site to fever and chills.
The 30,000 subjects are divided in two groups: those who get the vaccine and those who get a placebo.
“Even we don’t know which is which,” the nurse told me, when I asked about my group. Only Moderna knows – but not until the data is compiled and analyzed.
I asked about getting an antibody test, but the nurse said the results were not foolproof.
“Not knowing is going to kill me,” I said.
As she took my blood pressure, the nurse looked up at me and said, in a quite serious tone: “Placebos are as important as the vaccine. The trial needs a control group. You are helping humanity either way.”
I felt guilty for obsessing over my status, rather than concentrating on the overall goal – helping everybody overcome this pandemic. So I stopped asking questions.
The nurse took 6 to 8 vials of my blood – I lost count. They gave me a pregnancy test, and stressed the importance of using contraception during the trial, saying the potential side effects for a fetus were unknown.
Then two people came in with the vaccine in a cooler. Or maybe it was the placebo.
They laughed when I asked to document the moment in a picture. For them, it was just another Tuesday.
The injection didn’t hurt. They took me to a waiting room, where I stayed for half an hour of observation as a precaution. Three or 4 other volunteers scrolled through their phones as they waited.
One of the nurses wore a Superman cape.
“Why the cape?” I asked.
“Because we are all heroes here, girl,” she said.
I got a bunch of swag – stickers, a t-shirt, a mask – with “COVID warriors” or “COVID superheroes” written on it.
The lab had me download an app to track my temperature and any eventual symptoms.
When I got home, my arm was a bit sore. I wondered – did I actually get the vaccine? Three days of internet searches about “vaccine injection site,” “muscle pain,” and other terms got me nowhere.
The second dose came in mid-September. It hurt a lot more, and for a while. A hard, red knot emerged at the injection site.
But I still have no idea if it was the placebo or the vaccine. I have to wait for Moderna to tell me – someday.
I eventually realized that taking part in the trial was a way to process my grief – over losing my father and seeing the world turned upside down.
It was a small gesture, but it was the only way I knew how to make myself believe we are fighting back.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 18, 2020 9:39 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/business/profile-moderna-small-biotech-company-taking-on-coronavirus-pandemic/,"Moderna, the small biotech company taking on the pandemic","Moderna has long been a darling of investors but it wasn’t until the coronavirus pandemic came along that the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech company could prove the value of its new vaccine technology and mint some new billionaires.
Moderna announced on Monday, November 16, that its experimental vaccine against the coronavirus was 94.5% effective, about the same efficacy as the common vaccine against measles.
The announcement sent the share price of the company founded just a decade ago soaring on the Nasdaq in New York. Since January, Moderna has seen its share price quintuple.
Frenchman Stephane Bancel, 48, who has served as chief executive officer of Moderna since 2011, became a billionaire in April, when the very preliminary results of clinical trials on a COVID-19 vaccine were first published.
Bancel is currently worth some $3 billion through his 9% stake in the company, according to Forbes magazine.
Numerous investors have put their money on the biotech startup during the past decade in part due to the salesmanship of the Moderna CEO.
In 2018, Moderna set a record for an initial public offering by a biotech firm, raising more than $600 million.
The promising new technology attracted not only the attention of Wall Street but also that of the scientific community and a Nobel Prize winner is among the eminent advisors to the company.
Two of the founders and early investors in Moderna were Harvard University professor Timothy Springer and Robert Langer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
They both became billionaires this year, according to Forbes.
Speaking in 2012, another co-founder, Noubar Afeyan, said: “Moderna’s promise rivals that of the earliest biotechnology companies over 30 years ago – adding an entirely new drug category to the pharmaceutical arsenal in the fight against important diseases.”
Despite its promise, the company has not yet brought a product to market and the COVID-19 vaccine still needs the approval of health authorities before it can be shipped.
Moderna uses synthetic versions of molecules called “messenger RNA” to hack into human cells and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.
The concept was first developed in the 1990s, but it wasn’t until the mid-2000s that a way was found to modify synthetic RNA to prevent it from triggering a dangerous inflammatory response.
One of Moderna’s first projects was to try to develop targeted vaccines against various types of cancer, research which is still underway.
But Moderna quickly pivoted to addressing viruses and several clinical trials are taking place involving the Zika virus, Epstein-Barr, and others.
His former boss Alain Merieux at French diagnostics company bioMerieux told the newspaper Echos that Bancel has a “warrior temperament.”
When it comes to saving lives, Bancel does not deny being a hard taskmaster.
“You want to be the guy who’s going to fail them?” Bancel asked in a 2016 interview with the website Stat about working conditions at Moderna. “I don’t.
“So was it an intense place?” he said. “It was. And do I feel sorry about it? No.”
Moderna, which employs more than 1,000 people, about half at a factory in Massachusetts, does not have the production facilities needed to make the huge amounts of vaccine that will be needed around the world.
With US government assistance, it has formed partnerships with pharmaceutical firms with factories in the United States and Europe: Lonza, Rovi, Catalent.
The ever-optimistic Bancel has promised between 500 million and one billion doses in 2021 and hopes to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the United States by the end of the year, first for high-risk groups and later for children.
“We are very soon going to start a study in teenagers, and I’m hopeful that we might get the result by the summer,” he told Fox Business.
“So if a vaccine is proved to be effective and safe in children…they could potentially be vaccinated next summer so that they go back to school in September ’21.”",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 17, 2020 6:50 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/experimental-mrna-vaccines-come-to-fore/,Experimental mRNA vaccines come to fore as pandemic rages,"The “messenger RNA” technology used by the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 jabs works by hacking into the machinery of human cells and turning them into vaccine factories.
This platform has never received approval – but the coronavirus pandemic might be its moment to shine.
All vaccines work by training the body to recognize certain proteins, called “antigens,” that are made by disease-causing viruses or bacteria – thus priming the immune system to mount a response.
Traditional vaccines, like those for measles or the flu, do this by either injecting people with small amounts of the virus, or by giving them weaker “attenuated” forms of the virus.
But according to Drew Weissman, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania responsible for a key safety breakthrough in mRNA technology, “those take a lot of time to develop and to optimize.”
It can take scientists months to develop vaccines based on weakened viruses grown inside, for example, chicken eggs.
By contrast, this newer type of vaccine relies on messenger RNA, molecules that play a vital role in human biology, by putting DNA instructions into action and guiding cells on how to make proteins.
The synthetic mRNA in both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna-NIH vaccines carry instructions for a surface protein of SARS-CoV-2, called the “spike protein,” which the virus uses to invade human cells.
The vaccines make human cells grow these proteins so that they resemble the virus – which in turn elicits the production of antibodies that will latch on to the real virus and stop it from doing harm.
With mRNA vaccines, “the only thing you need is the sequence” of the antigen, said Weissman, which can take just a few weeks to find and construct.
The technology was first developed in 1990, but it wasn’t until the mid-2000s that Weissman and Katalin Kariko – now a senior vice president at Germany’s BioNTech – found a way to modify synthetic RNA to prevent it from triggering a dangerous inflammatory response that was killing lab mice.
There are certain important differences between the two vaccines.
Moderna has announced that its vaccine can remain stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2-8 degrees Celsius (36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) for 30 days.
It can be kept in long-term storage at standard freezer temperatures of -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit) for up to 6 months.
Pfizer’s vaccine, on the other hand, needs to be stored in deep-freezer conditions of -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit), which could complicate supply chain logistics, particularly in less developed countries.
On the downside, Moderna’s vaccine has about 3 times more genetic material per dose than its Pfizer counterpart, according to Zoltan Kis, a research associate at Imperial College’s Future Vaccine Manufacturing Hub. This raises production costs and makes it harder to scale up.
Pfizer has reported 90% efficacy and Moderna has reported almost 95% efficacy, but important questions still remain to be answered, according to Harvard immunologist Michael Mina.
When the vaccines are first administered, immune cells secrete huge numbers of antibodies, but these are temporary and “all of the efficacy data that we have gotten from the vaccine recipients is generally within just a few months,” he said.
We don’t yet know whether, after around 6 months, the immune system’s “memory cells” will be activated to make new antibodies if it encounters the virus again.
We also don’t yet have detailed data on how either vaccine works on the elderly, who have weaker immune systems and are the most vulnerable to COVID-19.
And finally, another open question is whether the vaccines stop people who are exposed to the virus from transmitting it to other people, even though they may be themselves protected from the disease.
Nevertheless, Weissman is upbeat about the platform’s future potential, noting that development is already underway for herpes, influenza, and HIV vaccines.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 17, 2020 10:37 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/report-names-shames-countries-cosy-big-tobacco/,Report names and shames countries cozy with Big Tobacco,"The global tobacco industry has aggressively lobbied governments during the COVID-19 pandemic to expand markets and blunt measures designed to curb their business, a report from watchdog groups aligned with the World Health Organization claimed on Tuesday, November 17.
A ranking of 57 countries based on their willingness to keep Big Tobacco at bay puts Japan and Indonesia at the bottom of the list, with Romania, China, and Lebanon among the 10 worst offenders.
The United States is the lowest-ranked wealthy nation, with Malaysia, Spain, Germany, and India also seen as too accommodating, said the report by non-profit groups based in France, England, and Thailand.
“The tobacco industry has a well-documented history of deception and of capitalizing on humanitarian crises, and it is using the pandemic to attempt to improve its deteriorating public image,” commented Adriana Blanco Marquizo, head of the secretariat for the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.
Tobacco claims some 8 million lives each year from cancer and other lung diseases, a million in China alone.
In several countries, stringent tobacco control measures were defeated or diluted.
Philip Morris International (PMI), for example, “lobbied for the promotion and sale of its heated tobacco product in a dozen countries,” resulting in the lifting of bans, lower taxes, and a voice in government-led deliberations on regulating tobacco products, the report found.
Taxes on these new nicotine delivery devices are now lower than cigarettes in France, Germany, and Japan.
Costa Rica, Zambia, and Bangladesh also eased the tax burden for tobacco firms.
During the pandemic, tobacco firms have been handing out personal protective equipment, ventilators, and hand sanitizers in countries across the world.
“While publicizing its charitable acts to resuscitate its image as being part of the solution, the industry was simultaneously lobbying governments not to impose restrictions on its business,” the report said.
In Kenya, the government listed tobacco products as “essential products” during the pandemic, and in Jordon cigarettes were delivered with bread and other foods directly to neighborhoods.
In contrast, India and South Africa banned the sale of tobacco products during the pandemic.
Meanwhile, Big Tobacco has sued to block plain packaging for cigarettes, sponsored cultural events, or sports teams, and challenged the legality of smoke-free zones.
The report was put together after former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg gave the researchers a three-year grant of $20 million to track how the industry markets its wares worldwide, especially in developing countries.
“This is the only product I know of where if you use it as advertised, it will kill you,” Bloomberg told AFP in 2018, when he awarded the grant.
More than 80% of the world’s 1.3 billion tobacco users live in low- and middle-income countries.
Smoking has plateaued in most rich nations, but in the developing world the total number of tobacco users – overwhelmingly men, especially the young – continues to climb.
The global tobacco market size was valued at nearly $850 billion in 2019.
The groups collaborating on the report included the Tobacco Research Group at the University of Bath, the Global Center for Good Governance in Tobacco Control, and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 17, 2020 10:26 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/coronavirus-crippling-fight-against-tuberculosis/,Coronavirus crippling fight against other pandemic – TB,"The global community is missing the chance to end the “modern tragedy” of tuberculosis, the biggest infectious killer, experts said Monday, November 16, warning how Earth’s other pandemic will worsen during COVID-19.
The fight against tuberculosis – a respiratory disease that is preventable and treatable yet kills more than 1.4 million people every year – is chronically underfunded, with diagnosis and treatment failing to reach millions.
The Stop TB Partnership (STBP) said many high-incidence countries were still treating patients with outdated methods, and warned that the progress made in slowing TB’s spread would be undermined by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“TB remains the top infectious disease killer, even though it is preventable and curable,” said STBP executive director Lucica Ditiu.
“To make matters worse, most countries still use outdated policies, practices and treatment regimes.”
The STBP’s annual progress report looked at how the disease is handled in 37 countries where tuberculosis is prevalent.
It found that close to 40 of countries were still treating drug-resistant forms of the disease with outdated injectables, courses of which are painful, long and hold a virtual coin-flip of a chance of success.
Drug-resistant TB also remains chronically under-diagnosed, with only 5,500 out of roughly 30,000 new cases in children diagnosed each year.
“We need to be better,” said Maxime Lunga, from the STPB in the Democratic Republic of Congo. “Every day more than 4,000 people die from TB. That is a modern tragedy.”
Doctors on Monday announced a new global study looking at the dual threat of COVID-19 among TB patients.
While there is likely a clear link between COVID-19 mortality and TB – given they are both severe lung infections – there has up to now been little comprehensive research on how the two diseases interact.
In a letter published in the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, doctors said they were looking at more than 600 COVID-19/TB patients across 36 countries with the aim of “better understanding how to prevent and manage this double curse.”
“What we are seeing today, in terms of the numbers of people dying from TB and from COVID-19, or being coinfected, is the consequence of broken promises and broken public health,” said Grania Brigden, Director of the Tuberculosis Department, The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease.
On the same day that Moderna announced its successful phase 3 vaccine trial results, Ditiu outlined the vast disparity in how TB research was organized and funded.
“There are 47 vaccines in human trial phases for COVID-19, all developed in less than a year,” she said. “For TB, over several years we have just one vaccine in human trials.”
She said that even if current funding levels were maintained, the TB vaccine wouldn’t come online until 2027.
“TB is an undermined, so-called ‘old disease’ and this very unfortunate situation will not receive attention,” said Tereza Kasaeva, director of the World Health Organization’s Global TB program.
“It’s no less important (than COVID-19). All these lives matter.”",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 16, 2020 11:56 PM PHT"

Moderna released early results from a clinical trial with more than 30,000 participants, after American pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech last week said their vaccine was 90% effective.
Both frontrunners are based on new technology that uses synthetic versions of molecules called “messenger RNA” to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.
“This positive interim analysis from our Phase 3 study has given us the first clinical validation that our vaccine can prevent COVID-19 disease, including severe disease,” said Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel.
“The light at the end of the tunnel just got even brighter,” tweeted Atul Gawande, a member of US President-elect Joe Biden’s coronavirus advisory board and a surgeon at a Harvard-affiliated hospital.
“We may now have multiple, very effective vaccines distributing widely in spring and summer,” he added.
Moderna plans to submit applications for emergency approval in the US and around the world within weeks, and says it expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the US by the end of the year.
It says it’s on track to manufacture between 500 million to a billion doses globally in 2021.
Global infections from Covid-19 have soared past 54 million with more than 1.3 million deaths since the virus emerged in China late last year.
The Moderna vaccine, which was co-developed by the US National Institutes of Health, is given in two doses 28 days apart, and the preliminary results are based on the 95 of the 30,000 volunteers who fell ill with Covid-19.
Of the 95, 90 had been in the trial’s placebo group, and 5 in the group that received the drug, called mRNA-1273, translating to an efficacy rate of 94.5%.
There were 11 people who fell severely ill, all of whom were in the placebo group.
The US government has invested around $2 billion in funding for development, manufacturing, and potential delivery of the vaccine under its Operation Warp Speed.
Most of the Moderna vaccine’s side-effects were classed as mild or moderate.
After the first dose, about 3% of people had injection site pain classed as severe.
Among severe side-effects after the second dose, about 10% had fatigue, 9% had muscle pain, 5% had joint pain or headaches, 4% had other pain and 2% had redness at the injection site.
These adverse events were “short lived” according to a statement.
“This news from Moderna is tremendously exciting and considerably boosts optimism that we will have a choice of good vaccines in the next few months,” said Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London.
Crucially, Moderna also announced that its vaccine can remain stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees Fahrenheit to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for 30 days.
The company added it could be kept in long-term storage at standard freezer temperatures of -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit) for up to 6 months.
Pfizer’s vaccine, on the other hand, needs to be stored in deep-freezer conditions of -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) which could complicate supply chain logistics, particularly in less developed countries.
On the downside, Moderna’s vaccine has about 3 times more genetic material per dose than its Pfizer counterpart, Zoltan Kis, a research associate at Imperial College’s Future Vaccine Manufacturing Hub, said.
This would raise production costs and make it harder to scale-up.
The promising results of both vaccines are seen as a validation for mRNA technology, which has never before been brought to regulatory approval.
It works by providing human cells with the genetic instructions to make a surface protein of the coronavirus, which trains the immune system to recognize the real virus.
Making a traditional vaccine is a longer process that normally involves developing a weakened form of a virus.
It is not yet clear how long lasting the protection will be from either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, nor how well they work for the elderly, the age-group at highest risk from Covid-19.
Another open question is whether they stop people who are exposed to the virus from transmitting it on to the other people, even though they may be themselves protected from the disease.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 16, 2020 8:11 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/sanofi-says-vaccine-wont-need-supercooling/,Sanofi says its vaccine won’t need supercooling,"The coronavirus vaccine being developed by Sanofi won’t need to be super-cooled and a normal refrigerator will suffice, the Paris-based drugmaker’s France chief Olivier Bogillot said Sunday, November 15.
His comments came days after American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced that their vaccine had proven 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials involving more than 40,000 people.
The companies said they expect to supply up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.
However, Pfizer’s vaccine must be stored at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) or else it falls apart, well beyond the capability of most hospital freezers let alone domestic appliances.
Rachel Silverman, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, has already warned that maintaining the Pfizer vaccine’s “ultra-cold chain” from factory to patients’ arms constitutes “an enormous logistical challenge even in the West.”
“Our vaccine will be like the ‘flu vaccine, you can keep it in your refrigerator,” this avoiding the problem, Bogillot told the CNews channel.
“This will be an advantage for some countries,” he added.
The Sanofi vaccine, one of many in development, will be available for distribution next June, Bogillot added.
The results of the Phase 2 tests, involving hundreds of people, will be made public in early December, he added. If those results are positive then Phase 3 trials involving thousands of people will begin, alongside mass production.
Eleven of the vaccines under development have already begun Phase 3 trials.
The Pfizer vaccine is “a little more advanced” in the development process, said Bogillot, but “one laboratory is not going to be able to supply the doses for the whole planet.
“We will need to have several winners at the end of this race.”

https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/trust-in-vaccines-vital-halting-pandemic/,Trust in vaccines vital to halting pandemic – WHO,"As the world celebrates advances in vaccines against the novel coronavirus, a top WHO expert warned in an interview with AFP that public distrust risked rendering even the most effective treatments useless against the pandemic.
“A vaccine that sits in a freezer or in a refrigerator or on a shelf and doesn’t get used is doing nothing to help shorten this pandemic,” said Kate O’Brien, director of the World Health Organization’s immunization department.
US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced Monday that their prospective vaccine had proven 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 infections in ongoing final phase trials involving more than 40,000 people.
O’Brien hailed the interim results as “extremely important”, and voiced hope that preliminary data from a handful of other candidate vaccines in similarly advanced trials would come through soon.
If the complete data show that “one or more of these vaccines has very, very substantial efficacy, that is really good news for putting another tool in the toolbox” for fighting the pandemic, she said.
But with the pandemic continuing to surge after already claiming some 1.3 million lives, she voiced deep concern at growing signs of vaccine hesitancy, with misinformation and mistrust coloring people’s acceptance of scientific advances.
“We are not going to be successful as a world in controlling the pandemic with the use of vaccines as one of the tools unless people are willing to get vaccinated,” O’Brien said.
More needed to be done to boost public “confidence in the fact that the vaccines that WHO is involved in evaluating, we will not be compromising on safety or efficacy,” she said.
O’Brien acknowledged that there were a number of outstanding questions about the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine candidate and its peers, including how long protection against the virus would last.
And while the vaccine candidates are being tested for how effectively and safely they protect people from developing the disease, it remains unclear whether they actually avert asymptomatic infection and transmission of the virus.
A big question, she said, is: “does it change your likelihood of transmitting to anybody else?”
Despite the remaining questions, the WHO is betting on one or more vaccines winning approval soon, followed by a rapid scale-up of production and distribution.
Anticipating the huge demand for any approved vaccine, the UN health agency has helped create the so-called Covax facility to ensure equitable distribution.
But even with gargantuan efforts, it will take a while before there are enough doses for everyone, and the WHO has set out guidelines for how to prioritize the distribution.
“The goal here is that every country should be able to immunize 20% of their population by the end of 2021,” O’Brien said.
That, she said, would go a long way to providing protection to healthcare workers and the most vulnerable populations, as well as those essential to keeping societies running, like teachers.
After that, how quickly everyone else could access a vaccine would largely depend on which country they live in, and whether their government had made deals to access vaccines that obtain approval.
“We would expect many more doses in 2022,” O’Brien said.
Meanwhile, the logistical challenges of getting approved vaccines out to billions who need it are daunting, from manufacturing to ensuring the transportation and storage at the extremely low temperatures some of the candidates require.
“A vaccine that is highly efficacious and is safe… still is only valuable for a public health impact if it actually gets to the people that it needs to protect and is used widely in populations,” O’Brien said.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-vaccine-best-science-news-2020-ifpma/,COVID-19 vaccine ‘best science news’ of 2020,"Data indicating that a vaccine being developed against COVID-19 is highly effective is the “best science news of the year,” a pharmaceutical industry association chief said, voicing hope that other vaccine candidates would show equally good results.
“A vaccine that has 90% efficacy and is pretty safe, that is a historic breakthrough,” the head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), Thomas Cueni, said.
American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced Monday, November 9, that their vaccine had proven 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials involving more than 40,000 people.
“This was the best science news of the year,” IFPMA’s director general told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) in an interview.
Hopes are also high that one or several of the vaccines under development will also help rein in the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed nearly 1.3 million people out of the over 51.5 million infected.
There are currently more than 40 candidate vaccines against COVID-19 being tested on humans, with a handful in the most advanced Phase 3 trials.
Cueni acknowledged that more data was needed on the Pfizer and BioNTech candidate, which is based on an innovative technology that has never been approved for use before.
The companies based their announcement on interim results from the last step in their clinical trial before officially applying for approval.
Cueni voiced confidence that any major safety concerns with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine would have been known.
“We still need to see the (full) efficacy and the safety data,” Cueni said, but stressed: “There is now genuine reason for optimism that these vaccines are basically considered safe.”
He said there is still a long list of unknowns about the vaccine’s protection, including whether it will be equally effective in all age groups and how long the protection might last.
Another pressing question is whether it will not only protect a person from Covid-19 infection but also prevent that person from transmitting the virus.
But Cueni said the data so far indicated the vaccine candidate was far more effective in preventing COVID-19 infections than the 50% efficacy threshold required by some regulators before considering authorization.
This was “big news”, he said, particularly “since I think there is reason to hope it won’t be the only one.”
“We will see more good results.”
Cueni said safety and efficacy data on at least four other vaccine candidates, being developed by Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax and Johnson & Johnson, would be known within the next few months.
He was optimistic that enough data would soon be available to win approval for using one or more of the COVID-19 vaccines.
And the large developers had already scaled up their manufacturing capacities, and were each in a position to produce upwards of a billion doses next year, he said.
But Cueni acknowledged there were numerous logistical challenges to actually inoculating the huge numbers of people it would take to bring the pandemic to a halt.
And he voiced concern about high levels of vaccine hesitancy in many countries.
Pharmaceutical companies were taking that challenge particularly seriously, he said, insisting they were going “way above and beyond the normal regulatory requirements” in terms transparency and data-sharing from trials.
The industry understood the importance of ensuring any authorised vaccine is trusted, he said.
“This is not only about COVID-19.”
Without trust, “the negative spillover on vaccination overall would be disastrous.”",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 12, 2020 8:04 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/planes-dry-ice-pharmacies-logistical-challenges-covid-19-vaccines/,"Planes, dry ice, pharmacies: The logistical challenges of COVID-19 vaccines","The United States could be the first country to launch one of the most ambitious vaccine operations in history: distributing and administering up to 600 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in just a few months.
Massive vaccine campaigns are nothing new – they have been carried out for decades in the fight against the measles and flu, for example.
But stamping out the coronavirus is a distinctly new challenge due to 3 factors: the short time frame for inoculating a huge number of people, the fact that most vaccines will require two doses, and the very low temperature at which some of the vaccines must be stored.
The vaccine developed by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech, on track to be the first authorized for use in the United States, must be stored at -94 degrees Fahrenheit (-70 degrees Celsius), whereas the flu vaccine can be kept in a normal refrigerator.
Pfizer vaccines distributed in the US will come from its largest manufacturing plant located in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Their ship-out will include a precise, clockwork-like dance of containers, trucks, and planes.
Thermal shipping containers will each be filled with dry ice and 975 vials of the vaccine which each contain 5 doses, for a total of 4,875 doses.
Every day 6 trucks will take the doses to air carriers such as FedEx, UPS or DHL, which will deliver them across the United States in one to two days and across the globe in 3, Pfizer told AFP.
The company expects an average of 20 daily cargo flights worldwide.
FedEx had to obtain special permission from civil aviation authorities to transport so much dry ice, which could pose a danger to the crew should it accidentally undergo “sublimation” and pass from a solid to a gas, the company told AFP.
Once the boxes have reached their final destination, they can be opened only briefly just two times a day.
“To run a large mass vaccination clinic, it’s fine,” said Julie Swann, a pandemic response expert at North Carolina State University.
But the vaccine would not be suitable for distribution at doctors’ offices or pharmacies, which are too small, she warned.
At least in the beginning Americans will have to go to hospitals or maybe even large distribution centers set up in parking lots much like COVID test sites, she said.
The vaccines can remain in their boxes for two weeks meaning hospitals will not need a special freezer.
“We’re not recommending at this time that hospitals or clinics purchase ultra cold equipment,” said Janell Routh of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
US biotech giant Moderna is also manufacturing a vaccine, which can be stored at -4 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of a normal freezer.
The US government is organizing a free distribution of this vaccine to US states and territories, with each jurisdiction to decide how to distribute the doses to hospitals, pharmacies, doctors, or even universities and companies will distribute the doses, in a decentralized system much like what was used for the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009.
“The federal government does not intend, with very, very few exceptions, to touch a single dose of vaccine before it goes into the arm of Americans,” said Paul Mango, an Operation Warp Speed official, during a briefing.
The objective is to offer vaccines to the most vulnerable populations before the end of December, to healthcare workers before the end of January and all Americans by the beginning of April.
Pfizer expects to produce 50 million doses this year and 1.3 billion in 2021: The United States has already ordered 100 million total including 20-30 million for delivery before the end of December. The European Union meanwhile has ordered 200 million, Japan 120 million, Britain 30 million, and Canada 20 million.
Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi, and others are hoping their own vaccines will also prove safe and effective, and their global rollout will follow suit.
Carrier DHL estimates that 15 million cooling boxes would need to be delivered over the next two years, with approximately 15,000 flights needed worldwide.
Poorer countries that lack storage capacity for large quantites of vaccines that need super-cold storage have little hope of benefiting from the first doses, said Prashant Yadav, an expert in global health supply chains at the Center for Global Development.
Ultracold freezers that can reach temperatures of -112 degrees Fahrenheit cost 5 times more than standard freezers and are only made to order, he said.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 11, 2020 9:38 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-90-percent-effective-phase-3-trial/,Pfizer says COVID-19 vaccine 90% effective in Phase 3 trial,"A vaccine jointly developed by Pfizer and BioNTech was 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials, the companies announced Monday, November 9.
The statement was released as coronavirus cases are soaring across the world, and European stock markets and oil prices jumped on the news.
According to preliminary findings, protection in patients was achieved 7 days after the second of two doses, and 28 days after the first.
“The first set of results from our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19,” Pfizer chairman and CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.
“We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis,” he said.
“We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most.”
Across much of the globe, COVID-19 infections rates are hitting record highs, with hospital intensive care units filling up and death tolls mounting.
Based on supply projections, the companies said they expect to supply up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.
US biotech firm Moderna, several state-run Chinese labs, and a European project led by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca are thought to be closing in on potentially viable vaccines.
Two Russian COVID-19 vaccines have been registered for us even before clinical trials were completed, but have not been widely accepted outside of Russia.
The Phase 3 clinical trial – the final stage – of the new vaccine, BNT162b2, began in late July and has enrolled 43,538 participants to date, 90% of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 8.
Pfizer said it is gathering two months of safety data following the final dose – a requirement of the US Food and Drug Administration – to qualify for Emergency Use Authorization, which it expects by the third week in November.
“We look forward to sharing additional efficacy and safety data generated from thousands of participants in the coming weeks,” Bourla said.
The so-called messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccine is a new approach to protecting against viral infection.
Unlike traditional vaccines, which work by training the body to recognize and kill proteins produced by pathogens, mRNA tricks the patient’s immune system to produce viral proteins itself.
The proteins are harmless, but sufficient to provoke a robust immune response.
The study also will evaluate the potential for the vaccine candidate to provide protection against COVID-19 in those who have had prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as vaccine prevention against severe COVID-19 disease.
Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit data from the full Phase 3 trial for scientific peer-review publication.
As of mid-October, the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 42 “candidate vaccines” at the stage of clinical trials, up from 11 in mid-June.
Ten of them were at the most advanced phase 3 stage, in which a vaccine’s effectiveness is tested on a large scale, generally tens of thousands of people across several continents.",Agence France-Presse,"Nov 9, 2020 8:08 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/science-solitaire-our-novelty-loving-brains/,[Science Solitaire] Our novelty-loving brains,"I would rather suffer than be bored. I was reviewing a “necessary” document a few days ago and it lacked such imagination that I wanted to give it a citation for “mainstreaming boredom.” I volunteered to rewrite the document even if I was running several deadlines for other things. The “kick” I feel to take or go to a new territory, even just in my head, gives me such good vibes that I don’t even think of it as another layer in my daily pile of tasks.
The brain is always seduced by a new thing. This is the basic truth about how our brain works. That is why “feeds” and “posts” work so profitably for the communication tech giants. It is why gifts work and why travel is so alluring.
A new study that came out just confirmed this by geo-tracking 132 people as they moved around in 3-4 months and asking them to record their moods as they do so. They found that people who went to places that they have not been before during the 3 months of the study turned out to be happier than the ones who did not go to new places.
And it was not just about going to a new place but also experiencing different things – including the diversity of ages, genders, and other socio-cultural elements that the places offered. Those who had these new experiences also reported better moods than those who had less varied experiences of a place.
The researchers even checked this with what is known in our actual brain processes and structures about the feeling of reward we get when we experience new things. It has been known for a while now that the connection between the two regions in our brain – the hippocampus and the striatum – are strengthened when we couple “newness” with the positive feeling of being rewarded. And indeed, by looking inside the brains of these people through brain scanning machines, the connections between these parts of the brain of the people who experienced a diversity of places and things appeared to be stronger than in the brains of those who did not.
That study may explain why it is probably a challenge to maintain a positive mood as we are confined in our homes more often than not because of the pandemic. Of course there are other things that can help improve our moods like remembering things that you should be grateful for, exercising, or doing things within your control. But in a pandemic, we cannot just head to the places and people we want to see and hug or even dine with. For 8 months now, we have not been feeling the “staple” daily rewards from these experiences that we have not had since then, which we took mostly for granted pre-COVID times.
For that, there seems to be a slight consolation, at least in terms of not getting stuck in old ideas, in the form of another recent discovery: you can imagine that you are moving. This is maybe how tech can bring us into positive territory in these times when it is just not safe to travel yet to get creative. The experiment used virtual reality for this, hooking people to it to make them feel like they are on a moving train. They compared this with people whom they also hooked onto virtual reality, but their train was a stopped train. They tested their creative skills while on this virtually moving train and it turned that people were more creative when they perceived themselves to be moving.
When you spin in place or go in circles, you get nauseous. That is your own biology telling you that you were not built to get stuck. Our brains are naturally wired to reach out to new people, places, and ideas. When the sorrow gets to me, I imagine the pandemic of hug-crazy, kiss-crazy, eat-together-crazy people we will all be when we emerge from this. We will meet again.  Then I feel like I can do this strange sort of isolation for at least one more day.",Maria Isabel Garcia,"Nov 8, 2020 11:00 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/regeneron-suspends-covid-19-antibody-trial-sickest-patients/,Regeneron suspends COVID-19 antibody trial among sickest patients,"US biotech firm Regeneron on Friday, October 30, said it was suspending enrollment for a study of its COVID-19 antibody treatment among the sickest patients who require high-flow oxygen or are on ventilators.
The move follows a recommendation from an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) which assesses the results and advises when it’s necessary to halt a study.
“Based on a potential safety signal and an unfavorable risk/benefit profile at this time, the IDMC recommends further enrollment of patients requiring high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation be placed on hold pending collection and analysis of further data on patients already enrolled,” the company said.
It added that the committee recommended that Regeneron continue to enroll hospitalized patients who either don’t need oxygen or are on low-flow oxygen, and recommends the continuation of the outpatient trial.
Regeneron said it was informing the US Food and Drug Administration, which is currently evaluating the treatment, called REGN-COV2, for an emergency use authorization in mild-to-moderate outpatients at high risk for poor outcomes.
It is also sharing its recommendation with the committee monitoring a separate RECOVERY trial in the UK which is evaluating REGN-COV2 in hospitalized patients.
REGN-COV2 was recently used to treat President Donald Trump on a so-called “compassionate use” basis.
While there are no additional details about why the hospitalized trial for the sickest patients has been suspended, scientists have always believed that antibody treatments should work best when given early on in COVID-19.
This is because they work by preventing the virus from invading human cells and replicating.
But by the time a patient has progressed to late-stage COVID-19, the main factor driving their illness is not the virus itself but an abnormal immune response that causes severe inflammation and organ damage.
That’s why current guidelines recommend treating late-stage patients with steroids, which dial down the immune system.
The human immune system itself develops antibodies, but because not everyone mounts an adequate response, companies like Regeneron are working on synthetic solutions.
They found two antibodies that were highly effective against the SARS-CoV-2 virus – one from a mouse with a human-like immune system, the other from a human – then harvested the cells that secreted them and grew them in a lab, to create a mass treatment combining the two.
The idea is seen as promising and the company recently received full regulatory approval for a similar treatment against the Ebola virus after it was proven to be safe and work well.
Regeneron has received more than $450 million from the US government for its COVID-19 drug development efforts.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 30, 2020 11:28 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/lancet-blasts-trump-virus-disaster-october-30-2020/,"Lancet blasts Trump’s virus ‘disaster,’ urges vote for change","The Lancet has become the latest science journal to urge Americans to vote for change in next week’s presidential election, publishing a scathing editorial Friday, October 30, that described the US pandemic response under Donald Trump as “disastrous.”
The medical journal did not explicitly back Democratic challenger Joe Biden in its commentary, focusing instead on the issues it said had hindered the US from adequately tackling the “greatest public health crisis in a century.”
It highlighted the country’s “fraying social safety net, continual erosion of trust in the public sector, the perceived diminished responsibility of the federal government, and political interference with crucial public health apparatus” – particularly in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
These it said “have culminated in the disastrous US response to the coronavirus pandemic.”
Trump’s handling of the pandemic has been a key theme in the election campaign, with the president accused of undermining scientific institutions and spreading false information.
America is the world’s worst-hit country, with 8.94 million cases, and on Thursday, October 29, it announced a record number of new coronavirus cases, topping the grim milestone of more than 90,000 diagnoses in 24 hours.
The Lancet editorial said the US was experiencing a “continuing devaluation of science,” as well as a range of rights inequalities.
The Trump administration had rolled back protections for individuals, workers and the environment, it said, adding that the country had turned inwards, with the US’s intended withdrawal from international agreements and agencies like the World Health Organization.
“With so much loss and still more at stake, the 2020 presidential election is the opportune moment for the American electorate to embrace change for the better,” it said.
It urged voters to “reject the stagnancy of complacency, to exchange a view bereft of intention with a vision of progress, and to rejoin the global community in the pursuit of a more equitable and sustainable future.”
Several other major scientific publications have issued caustic assessments of Trump’s legacy on health and science in the weeks leading up to the November 3 polls.
Earlier this month the journal Nature, one of the world’s most prestigious scientific publications, said it was backing Biden for US president.
Its editorial said “no US president in recent history has so relentlessly attacked and undermined” vital institutions such as scientific agencies, the Department of Justice and the electoral system itself.
It excoriated Trump for pulling out of the 2015 Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, as well as for his attacks on the WHO – something it labeled “unthinkable during a pandemic.”
Earlier in the month, the New England Journal of Medicine slammed the US’s “astonishing” failure to bring COVID-19 cases and deaths under control, but stopped short of explicitly endorsing Biden in next month’s election.
But the election has caused other publications to break with tradition and endorse a White House candidate.
Last month, for the first time in its 175-year history, US magazine Scientific American endorsed a candidate, saying it was opting for Biden.
“We do not do this lightly,” the editors wrote in a sulphuric anti-Trump editorial published online for the magazine’s October issue.
“The evidence and the science show that Donald Trump has badly damaged the US and its people – because he rejects evidence and science,” they wrote.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 30, 2020 10:25 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/moderna-already-has-1-1b-in-deposits-for-covid-19-vaccine/,Moderna already has $1.1B in deposits for COVID-19 vaccine,"Moderna said Thursday, October 29, it took in $1.1 billion in deposits in the third quarter for a coronavirus vaccine that it is “actively preparing” to launch.
The biotech company, releasing quarterly results, completed its enrollment earlier this month for the phase-3 trial of “mRNA-1273,” a vaccine candidate for Covid-19.
“We are actively preparing for the launch of mRNA-1273 and we have signed a number of supply agreements with governments around the world,” said Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel.
“I believe that if we launch our COVID-19 vaccine, 2021 could be the most important inflection year in Moderna’s history. We will have the resources to scale Moderna to maximize the impact we can have on patients in the next 10 years through numerous new medicines.”
Moderna, among the furthest along in developing a vaccine for COVID-19, has signed supply contracts with the US, Canada, Switzerland, Japan, Israel and Qatar and is in talks with other parties, including the European Union.
Moderna said there would be two interim analyses of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate and that the company is committed to “full transparency” in the development of the vaccine.
The company, founded in 2010, reported a loss of $233.6 million in the third quarter on revenues of $157.9 million.
The company had nearly $4.0 billion in cash at the end of the quarter, including more than $1 billion in deferred revenues connected to supply agreements with government agencies for future COVID-19 vaccine supply.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 30, 2020 3:02 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/who-decides-when-vaccine-studies-done-fauci/,Who decides when vaccine studies are done? Internal documents show Fauci plays a key role,"This story was originally published by ProPublica.
Dr Anthony Fauci, the US’ top infectious disease official, will oversee most of the ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials in the US, but not that of the current front-runner made by Pfizer, documents obtained by ProPublica show.
According to a draft charter spelling out how most of the advanced COVID-19 vaccine trials will be monitored, Fauci is the “designated senior representative” of the US government who will be part of the first look at the results. That puts Fauci in the room with the companies – including Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca – in deciding whether the vaccines are ready to seek approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
Fauci’s role, which has not been previously reported and was confirmed for ProPublica by the National Institutes of Health, could offer some reassurance in the face of widespread concerns that President Donald Trump wants to rush through an unproven vaccine. As Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for vice president, put it at October 7’s debate, “If the public health professionals, if Dr Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I’ll be the first in line to take it.”
But there’s a big caveat. Fauci doesn’t have the same hands-on role for the vaccine that seems poised to show results soonest: Pfizer’s. That’s because Pfizer opted not to accept government funding and participate in the federal program to develop a coronavirus vaccine, known as Operation Warp Speed. (The government did make an almost $2-billion deal with Pfizer to preorder up to 600 million doses of the company’s vaccine, but it isn’t contributing money to the vaccine’s development like it is for other companies.)
“(We) offered opportunities for collaboration with Pfizer,” said a spokesperson for the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a branch of the NIH. “Pfizer chose to conduct their Phase 3 study without Operation Warp Speed or NIH support.”
Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, said Friday that the earliest his company would be ready to apply for authorization would be the third week of November. While Pfizer might know by the end of October if its vaccine is effective, it would need additional time to gather sufficient safety data to present to the FDA, Bourla said in an open letter on the company’s website.
Fauci’s role in overseeing the companies that are participating in Operation Warp Speed arises from a unique arrangement that the government set up to monitor the trials. Typically, clinical trials set up their own independent panels of scientists, known as a data safety monitoring board or DSMB, to watch out for safety concerns or early signs of success. But all of the vaccine trials in Operation Warp Speed are sharing a common DSMB whose members were selected by Fauci’s agency, the NIAID. They’re also sharing a network of clinical trial sites where some volunteers are recruited for the studies.
A DSMB is responsible for making recommendations such as halting the trial if there is a safety concern or letting the manufacturer know that there’s enough evidence to submit an application to the FDA. Ordinarily, a DSMB’s recommendation goes to the company running the trial. In this case, the US government – which gets two representatives, one from the NIAID and one from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority – will also have a seat at the table in deciding what to do next.
“Once the DSMB makes a decision, the DSMB provides the recommendation to not only the study sponsor but also to the” US government, whose “designated senior representative” is Fauci, the NIAID confirmed in an email. Fauci declined to be interviewed.
That’s not the same as saying Fauci has the last word. The company and the government are supposed to reach a consensus, the agency said. But if they can’t all agree, the ultimate decision belongs with the company.
Still, it would be an improbably brazen move for a company to move ahead over Fauci’s objection, given his public stature, experts said. “These are the most important trials in medical history, this is the ultimate fishbowl,” said Dr Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. “I don’t think any sponsor would dare defy the DSMB’s recommendation.”
While the mechanics of a DSMB may be unfamiliar to most members of the public, people probably know and trust Fauci, according to Amy Pisani, executive director of the national nonprofit organization Vaccinate Your Family. “(He’s) the sweetheart of the nation right now,” Pisani said. “I do think people have faith in Anthony Fauci.”
“Having Fauci with oversight is terrific,” Topol added. “The more people who are experts looking at it, the better. You can’t be careful enough.”
Other members of the DSMB for the COVID-19 vaccines, though not as well known as Fauci, are also widely respected in their fields. DSMB members are typically kept confidential to shield them from outside influence, but ProPublica has been able to identify a few members. The charter obtained by ProPublica described the group, which has about a dozen members, as having expertise in “biostatistics, clinical trials, infectious diseases, vaccine development, and ethics.”
The panel’s chair is Dr Richard Whitley, a professor of pediatrics, microbiology, medicine, and neurosurgery at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. His role became public when the university announced it, though the webpage was later taken down.
His leadership provides another level of comfort in the trustworthiness of the trials to those who know him. “He is not only famously bright but he is famously independent and outspoken,” said Dr William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt Medicine. “He’ll look at the data and tell you exactly what he thinks.”
Whitley declined to comment.
(He’s) the sweetheart of the nation right now. I do think people have faith in Anthony Fauci.
Amy Pisani, Executive Director of Vaccinate Your Family
Susan Ellenberg, professor of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania and a former director at the FDA, told ProPublica in an interview that many people, including herself, were worried the NIH might be “pushed by the political leadership at HHS to release data” from trials prematurely, which could undermine the integrity of a trial. HHS, the US Department of Health and Human Services, is the NIH’s parent agency. Her concern was that political leaders might not understand scientific arguments to not disrupt the trials when wanting to have data “to be able to move quickly in an urgent situation,” she said.
At the time of the interview, Ellenberg had not identified herself as a member of the NIH’s DSMB, but later acknowledged that she was a member.
Dr Malegapuru William Makgoba, an immunologist based in South Africa, is one of a few international members of the DSMB. Makgoba is well known for his work on public health initiatives around HIV/AIDS, including the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative. Makgoba confirmed his role on the DSMB but declined to comment further.
The common DSMB appears to be unprecedented, if only because there have not previously been multiple vaccines in development for the same disease at the same time. Experts said the arrangement offers benefits such as bolstering the evidence available to show that any one shot is safe and effective.
Standardizing trial measurements should make the vaccines easier to compare head to head, which may be useful for knowing whether one is better or worse than another in certain subgroups, such as the elderly or people with compromised immune systems, according to Vanderbilt’s Schaffner.
“To me, it’s better for public health to have a fairly common assessment,” said Dr Gregory Glenn, president of research and development at Novavax, which has received $1.6 billion from Operation Warp Speed and hopes to begin its Phase 3 trial in the US this month as part of the NIH’s clinical trial network.
There may also be some benefits from a safety perspective.
If a potential safety issue appears in one trial, having a common data safety monitoring board for multiple trials means that the board knows to look out for that same issue across all the trials, said Dr Tal Zaks, chief medical officer of Moderna. “When AstraZeneca had an adverse side effect, we have a DSMB looking at our trial — the fact that it’s the same DSMB means that there’s not one DSMB that has to go educate another DSMB,” Zaks said. (ProPublica’s board chairman, Paul Sagan, is a member of Moderna’s board and a company stockholder.)
AstraZeneca’s trial has been put on hold in the U.S. while the company and the FDA investigates what happened with a participant who had a bad reaction. It’s not yet clear whether the reaction was due to the vaccine or unrelated.
“AstraZeneca is committed to working with governments and key partners to ensure we develop and gain regulatory approval for an effective vaccine as quickly as possible,” the company said in a statement.
AstraZeneca added that another benefit of joining the government’s consortium was that its large network of trial sites can help reach minority communities that are historically less represented in clinical trials and also more vulnerable to COVID-19.
Pfizer’s decision not to participate means that it and the other companies may miss out on some of these benefits of pooling resources. “It’s at least unfortunate, and not very sporting, as the British would say,” Schaffner said.
At the same time, there could be advantages to Pfizer’s going solo. “One of the greatest risks to this process is the perception of political influence, and in that regard, having parallel efforts, especially efforts seen as independent of one another and/or independent of perceived sources of political influence, is a good thing,” said Mani Foroohar, an analyst at the investment bank SVB Leerink.
Pfizer declined to comment on its decision not to join the government’s shared DSMB and trial network.
Whether it’s Pfizer or one of the companies participating in Operation Warp Speed, the final say on whether a vaccine is ready for public use belongs to the FDA.
The FDA has promised to present the data to an advisory committee of external experts in a public meeting. A preliminary meeting will be held on Oct. 22 to discuss, generally, the standards the FDA will seek to see before authorizing any vaccine. The agency has also committed to holding advisory committee meetings to review data from individual vaccine candidates.
Between the independent trial safety monitoring boards and the public advisory committee meetings, “any kind of hanky-panky there that people are worried about is going to (go through) multiple checkpoints,” Fauci said in an interview with Dr Howard Bachner on the JAMA Network podcast on Sept. 25. “The big elephant in the room is, is somebody going to try to make a political end run to interfere with the process?.… If you look at the standard process of how these things work, I think you can feel comfortable that it is really unlikely that that is going to happen.” – ProPublica | Rappler.com

Three dogs, named Kossi, ET, and Miina, have sniffed swabs taken from 2,200 passengers in the month since the testing booth was set up at the airport’s arrivals hall, and have found the virus in 0.6% of travelers.
Although the research is not due for completion until December, the team say the initial findings appear broadly in line with detection rates of the nasal PCR tests also conducted on arriving travelers.
“We have done 16-17,000 PCR tests at the airport and less than 1% are positive,” Timo Aronkyto, deputy mayor of Vantaa, told reporters.
Compared to the results found by the dogs, “they are about the same, I don’t think there is a statistical difference,” Aronkyto said.
The researchers are now analyzing how closely the two sets of test results match each other – whether the dogs found coronavirus in passengers whose infection was confirmed by a PCR test – and hope to publicize their findings at the end of the year.
Preliminary experiments in the first major wave of infections earlier in the year suggested the dogs can detect the virus with close to 100% accuracy, up to 5 days earlier than a PCR test.
Feedback from arriving passengers, who take the free-of-charge test voluntarily, “has been exceptionally positive,” project manager Soile Turunen said.
Around 100 travelers a day have been queuing up for the test, which involves wiping a swab onto the skin which is then put in front of the dog, who will quickly pass over a negative sample but will be attracted to a positive one.
“People don’t complain about the queues, in fact it’s the opposite,” Turunen said.
“They’re coming up to us to to say ‘Hi’ from morning until evening,” she added.
A fourth dog, a German shepherd called Valo, is currently in training to begin work at the airport testing booth.
The Helsinki University researchers behind the trial, working with sniffer-dog specialists from the organization Wise Nose, hope that their research will persuade the government to fund a rollout of the dogs for other uses, such as at tourist hotspots or large public gatherings.
Although sniffer dog trials have been undertaken elsewhere, such as in the UAE, France, Russia, and Chile, use of canine scent-detectors to bolster coronavirus testing has not yet been widely adopted by authorities, in part because of a lack of peer-reviewed literature, some researchers believe.
Dog handling charities have previously worked with dogs to detect cancers, Parkinson’s disease and bacterial infections using samples taken from humans.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 29, 2020 10:57 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/prevention-based-strategies-needed-in-fight-against-breast-cancer/,Prevention-based strategies needed in fight against breast cancer,"I’m tired of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Forgive me, but as a researcher studying how we understand information on links between environmental and occupational exposures and breast cancer, I’ve grown weary of yet another October decorated in pink, promoting the same message of awareness. The message itself has become tired, and awareness-raising alone is an ineffective solution to the breast cancer epidemic.
Year after year, we miss opportunities for critical interventions into the primary prevention of breast cancer. For my dissertation research on awareness of environmental breast cancer risks, I interviewed women workers at the Ambassador Bridge, where there are high rates of breast cancer. Larissa* pointed out:
Screening and early detection programs are widely promoted, advocacy for treatments continues and survival with breast cancer for some groups of women has improved. These are crucial pieces for tackling breast cancers that develop. But comparatively little effort seems to go into primary prevention, which means stopping cancer before it starts.
What we’re calling out in #WeCantBePinkd: The @EPA focuses on profit at the expense of the environment; the @US_FDA isn't doing enough for patients; @theNCI ignores environmental causes of #BreastCancer; & the @TheJusticeDept intends to invalidate the ACA https://t.co/3hSh7JfdiR pic.twitter.com/l9w7JOCFg9
The focus persists on advising women to exercise, eat well and limit alcohol intake. Messaging about the need for policy, regulation, legislation, strategies and programs that prioritize primary prevention from environmental exposures to breast carcinogens are inconspicuous.
I recognize that Breast Cancer Awareness Month provides an opportunity for contribution, engagement and hope. And I understand why women and their allies support these initiatives. It offers a chance to feel some power over a disease that creates so much fear and suffering.
Nearly 630,000 women across the globe died from breast cancer last year. The overall global incidence of breast cancer continues to rise with marginal improvements in five-year survival rates. North American women face a 1 in 8 lifetime risk for breast cancer, with almost 525 new diagnoses of breast cancer each week in Canada. Fourteen Canadian women die each day from breast cancer. Incidence is rising in younger women, specifically in premenopausal women.
Only 5 to 10%  of cases are related to genetics, with family history, lifestyle and behavior factoring into overall incidence. Fewer than 50% of breast cancers can be explained by known or suspected risk factors. Research suggests that environmental factors may contribute in 70 to 90% of breast cancer cases.
When I interviewed Annie, she said:
With Annie’s words and those of other women in mind, I recently wrote to governmental leaders, ministries, public health agencies and the Canadian Cancer Society. I conveyed my concerns about the focus on awareness that highlights lifestyle factors and omits exposures in our living and working environments. I suggested we need more action on primary prevention to limit or eliminate exposures to known and suspected breast carcinogens.
My letter also reflected Erin’s thoughts:
To implement practical primary prevention activities, we need to draw on the science of the associations between breast cancer and risky exposures in our social environments. For example, when we know women are being exposed to identified breast carcinogens in their workplaces, why are we not reducing or eliminating these exposures to prevent breast cancer?
When we know that there are endocrine-disrupting chemicals in personal care products, and these are associated with an elevated risk for breast cancer, why are we not eliminating or replacing these substances?
When science tells us that women in areas with high volumes of air pollution, especially vehicle exhaust, are at a higher risk of developing premenopausal breast cancer, why are we not putting controls on pollutants or developing alternatives?
When we know there are disparities in breast cancer incidence and survival across groups of racialized women, why are we ignoring social determinants of health in our strategies to mitigate risk and to prevent the disease?
Science provides the evidence of exogenous exposures that contribute to the development of breast cancer. Many of these exposures are outside of the control of individual women; they are involuntary exposures not modifiable with lifestyle or behavioural changes. Instead, systemic changes — regulations, legislation, policies — with the protection of the public is fundamental to prevention. We need the political will and those with power to enact these critical changes.

Pink products and awareness-raising are not enough. At this time, when COVID-19, climate change and political turmoil dominate our thoughts, it is tiring even to begin to think of adding yet another struggle to the list. But to effect real change against the breast cancer epidemic, we need more powerful, structural strategies that prevent exposures to known and suspected breast carcinogens in the places we live and work.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-still-possible-2020-despite-data-lag/,Pfizer says COVID-19 vaccine still possible in 2020 despite data lag,"Pfizer executives expressed measured optimism Tuesday, October 27, over the prospect of providing a coronavirus vaccine in 2020 even as they signaled key data on the vaccine would not be released before the US election.
Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said the drug giant could supply some 40 million doses in the United States in 2020 if clinical testing proceeds as expected and regulators approve a vaccine.
“If all goes well, we will be ready to distribute an initial number of doses,” said Bourla, who pointed to a US government contract for Pfizer to supply 40 million doses by the end of this year and 100 million doses by March 2021.
But Bourla said the company still had not reached key benchmarks in assessing vaccine efficacy.
Pfizer previously said it could have the data in October, which might have advanced the process ahead of the November 3 presidential election.
“We have reached the last mile here,” Bourla said. “So let’s all have the patience that’s required for something so important for public health and the global economy.”
He said the company expects to file for emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine in the third week of November, roughly in line with earlier timetables.
Asked if he was “bullish” the vaccine would work, Bourla said: “I’m cautiously optimistic that the vaccine will work.”
Pfizer reported a 71% drop in profit to $2.2 billion in the latest quarter. However, the comparable period last year included a large gain connected to a transaction.
Revenues dipped 4% to $12.1 billion, missing analyst estimates.
Pfizer estimated a revenue hit of $500 million connected to COVID-19 due to lower pharma demand in China and fewer wellness visits by US patients.
The company saw an 11% drop in its hospital business in emerging markets, primarily due to fewer elective surgeries in China and shorter in-patient hospital stays in the country.
This effect was partially offset by increased demand for the Prevnar-13 vaccine for pneumonia “resulting from greater vaccine awareness for respiratory illnesses,” the company said.
Pfizer also cited strong performance in its biopharma business due to good sales for cancer drug Ibrance, anticoagulant Eliquis, and other medications.
Rival drugmaker Merck also is working on coronavirus vaccines, but the company is at an earlier phase compared with Pfizer.
Merck said one coronavirus vaccine candidate had entered phase 1 development and a second candidate would reach that stage shortly.
Merck reported a 55% jump in quarterly earnings to $2.9 billion on a 1% rise in revenues to $12.6 billion.
Shares of Pfizer fell 1.3% to $37.43, while Merck shed 1.1% to $77.99.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 28, 2020 9:04 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/russia-seeks-accelerated-who-registration-virus-vaccine/,Russia seeks accelerated WHO registration for virus vaccine,"Russia has applied to the World Health Organization for accelerated registration and prequalification of its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, the country’s sovereign wealth fund said on Tuesday, October 27.
Russia announced in August it had registered the world’s first coronavirus vaccine, named Sputnik V after the Soviet-era satellite.
On Tuesday, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which finances the vaccine, said that accelerated registration would make the Russian vaccine “available globally in a shorter time frame than usual procedures.”
“The Russian Federation has become one of the first countries to apply to WHO for prequalification of its vaccine against the novel coronavirus infection,” the fund said in a statement.
“Successful prequalification will enable Sputnik V to be included in the list of medicines used by international procurement agencies and countries to guide bulk purchasing of medicines.”
Some Western scientists have expressed concern over the Russian vaccine, with some warning that moving too quickly could be dangerous.
Earlier this month President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia had registered its second coronavirus vaccine, EpiVacCorona.
Russia has the fourth-highest virus caseload in the world, with a total of 1,547,774 registered infections and 26,589 deaths.
On Tuesday, health authorities reported a record 320 deaths from the coronavirus over the past 24 hours as officials tightened anti-virus restrictions including enforcing mask-wearing in public spaces.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 27, 2020 11:29 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/giving-up-virus-control-dangerous-who-chief/,Giving up on virus control ‘dangerous’ – WHO chief,"The World Health Organization chief warned Monday, October 26, that abandoning efforts to control the coronavirus pandemic, as suggested by a top US official, was “dangerous,” urging countries not to “give up.”
“We must not give up,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing.
He acknowledged that after months of battling the new coronavirus, which has claimed more than 1.1 million lives globally, a certain level of “pandemic fatigue” had set in.
“It’s tough and the fatigue is real,” Tedros said.
“But we cannot give up,” he added, urging leaders to “balance the disruption to lives and livelihoods.”
“When leaders act quickly, the virus can be suppressed.”
His comment came a day after US President Donald Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows told CNN that the administration’s focus had moved to mitigation, not stamping out the virus.
“We’re not going to control the pandemic. We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics, and other mitigations,” Meadows said, comparing the more deadly COVID-19 to the seasonal flu.
Asked about Meadows’ comments, Tedros said he agreed that focusing on mitigation, and especially on protecting the vulnerable, was important.
“But giving up on control is dangerous,” he insisted.
Tedros stressed that mitigation and controlling the pandemic were “not contradictory. We can do both.”
While governments have a responsibility to ensure things like testing and contact tracing, he emphasized that everyone had a responsibility to halt the spread of COVID-19.
“Governments should do their share and our citizens should do their share, to do everything to minimize transmission,” he said.
“There aren’t magic solutions to this outbreak,” he insisted.
“No one wants more so-called lockdowns. But if we want to avoid them, we all have to play our part.”
When asked about Meadows’ comments, WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan also said countries should “not give up on trying to suppress transmission.”
“There were many places in the US and elsewhere that had a lot of trouble back in March and April using mitigation,” he said.
“When our emergency rooms were overwhelmed and we were rolling freezer trucks up to the back of hospitals, that’s the reality of mitigating a disease in the face of a tsunami of cases.
“You run out of capacity to cope. And that is the fear right now.”
He voiced particular concern about the situation in Europe, which in the past week accounted for 46% of global cases, and nearly a third of global deaths.
“There’s no question that the European region is an epicenter for disease right now,” Ryan said.
Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on the pandemic, also voiced concern about the situation in Europe – and in particular a surge in hospitalizations and rapidly filling intensive care units.
“In many cities we’re seeing beds filling up too quickly, and we’re seeing many projections saying the ICU beds will reach capacity in the coming days and weeks,” she told Monday’s briefing.
But Van Kerkhove voiced optimism, pointing out that “countries across Europe brought transmission under control in the springtime into the summertime, with case numbers at very low levels.”
“They can do this again,” she said, stressing that the measures needed to halt transmission were well known.
“The other option is if we don’t quarantine contacts of known cases, then everyone’s going to have to be in quarantine – and that’s what we want to avoid.”",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 27, 2020 9:12 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/air-pollution-linked-coronavirus-deaths/,Air pollution linked to 15% of coronavirus deaths – study,"Long-term exposure to air pollution may be linked to 15% of COVID-19 deaths globally, according to research published Tuesday, October 27, that highlights the health risks posed by greenhouse gas emissions.
Previous research has showed how air pollution from exhaust fumes and factories takes two years off the life expectancy of every man, woman, and child on Earth.
Now experts in Germany and Cyprus say they have estimated the proportion of deaths from coronavirus that can be blamed of the exacerbating effects of air pollution.
Their study, published in the journal Cardiovascular Research, drew on health and disease data from the US and China relating to air pollution, COVID-19 and SARS – a serious lung disease similar to COVID.
They combined this with satellite data of global exposure to particulate matter – microscopic particles – as well as ground-based pollution monitoring networks, to calculate to what extent air pollution can be blamed for COVID-19 deaths.
In East Asia, which has some of the highest levels of harmful pollution on the planet, the authors found that 27% of COVID-19 deaths could be attributed to the health effects of poor air quality.
In Europe the proportion was 19%, compared with 17% in North America.
“If both long-term exposure to air pollution and infection with the COVID-19 virus come together then we have an adverse effect on health, particularly with respect to the heart and blood vessels,” said paper co-author Thomas Munzel.
He said that air pollution made known COVID-19 risk factors such as lung and heart problems more likely.
Specifically, the team noted that particulate matter appeared to increase the activity of a receptor on lung cell surfaces, ACE-2, which is known to be involved in the way COVID-19 infects patients.
“So we have a double hit: air pollution damages the lungs and increases the activity of ACE-2, which in turn leads to enhanced uptake of the virus,” said Munzel, a professor at the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz.
The authors stressed that attributing COVID-19 deaths to air pollution did not mean that pollution itself was killing people with COVID – though they didn’t rule out such a cause-effect linkage.
Jos Lelieveld, of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, told AFP that the research suggested “the pollution particles are a co-factor in aggravating the disease.”
He said their estimates suggested that more than 6,100 COVID deaths in Britain could be attributed to air pollution. In the US that figure is around 40,000.
The authors said that without a fundamental change in how cities power themselves, including a transition to clean and renewable energy sources, air pollution would continue to kill huge numbers of people even after the pandemic recedes.
“The pandemic ends with the vaccination of the population or with herd immunity through extensive infection of the population,” they wrote.
“However, there are no vaccines against poor air quality and climate change. The remedy is to mitigate emissions.”",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 27, 2020 8:53 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/relationships/advocates-push-decriminalization-abortion/,‘Give women options’: Advocates push for decriminalization of abortion,"“We want to give women options whenever they face a particular situation, and that’s not something we can judge them for.”
This was what Shiph Belonguel, youth reproductive health rights advocate, said during the 3rd episode of Spilling the Tea, a webinar series held by Rappler and SheDecides Philippines, a movement that promotes the fundamental rights of adolescent girls and women.
In the episode “My abortion story” aired on October 8, Rappler’s sex and gender columnist Ana P. Santos talked to Kristine Chan of the Philippine Safe Abortion Advocacy Network, and guest panelists Atty Claire Padilla, founder and executive director of EnGendeRights Incorporate, Shiphrah Belonguel, and Atty Jihan Jacob, senior legal advisor of Center for Reproductive Rights.
The discussion was also joined by two women, *Candice and Sheila, who both decided not to continue their pregnancies.
Candice said that she didn’t regret at all aborting her child, but felt guilty for not feeling guilty. “I was questioning myself – am I a bad person? But I didn’t regret it at all because I was sure that time that I was not ready for a baby,” she said.
“The portrayal of the media is very negative and there are stereotypes for a woman getting pregnant at the wrong time. But there are a lot of reasons why women need to get an abortion. It’s not just unwanted pregnancy. There are victims of abuse and rape. It’s not a just a single [reason]. I hope people are not judgmental,” Candice said in a mix of English and Filipino.
Echoing Candice, Chan said that media portrays abortion in a “really negative way and that stigma is really still strong in the Philippines.”
Candice realized that what she went through was dangerous, since it was done secretly due to the restrictive abortion law in the Philippines.
“Even if I survived the procedure, it wasn’t 100% safe. Sana magkaroon ng (I hope there will be) safe abortion facilities, ‘yung gagawin mo siya nang hindi patago (where you don’t have to do it in secret). Not in makeshift clinics,” Candice said.
Meanwhile, Sheila, who is separated from her husband, decided to get an abortion by taking medicines because she didn’t have the luxury to keep the baby at that time, as she was in a complicated relationship.
“I made the right decision. But a part of me also really strongly believes that I didn’t have a choice. I already have one child with my ex-husband who is not a very good person. He is using the child to hurt me in various ways,” she added.
Sheila lamented about how women are seen as selfish whenever they decide to get an abortion. “It is infinitely more selfish to bring another life in the world and not be able to care for it the way it deserves to be cared for,” she added.
Santos said that the discourse on abortion in the country now is only about guilt, and that this is wrong.
“Our laws are so restrictive. If Candice and Sheila would come out, they could get arrested and imprisoned for deciding not to continue their pregnancy,” Santos added.
The Philippines has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world, penalizing persons seeking access to abortion services and those who assist them with imprisonment. This has forced women to resort to unsafe methods to end their unintended pregnancies.
Padilla said that the Philippine abortion law is so “archaic and colonial,” as it is based on a 1930’s revised penal code that penalizes women up to 6 years imprisonment. “Even if the woman is at risk for her life or health, there are no exceptions,” she explained.
Padilla said women have been dying due to unsafe abortion in the country, noting that her group has been pushing to decriminalize abortion. “This is a medical issue, not a moral issue,” she said.
Complications from unsafe abortion is one of the 5 leading causes of maternal death and a leading cause of hospitalization in the Philippines. (READ: [OPINION] Why we need to decriminalize abortion)
Citing international human rights standards, Jacob said the government should decriminalize abortion so women would have access to clean and safe abortion.
Jacob said if the government denies women’s access to abortion, “we’re also violating their fundamental human rights.”",Bonz Magsambol,"Oct 26, 2020 2:50 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/how-behavior-childhood-predicts-whether-relationship-adult/,How your behavior in childhood predicts whether you’ll be in a relationship as an adult,"The following was originally published in The Conversation.
The question of how to find a steady romantic partnership is among the oldest human predicaments. There is consequently considerable interest in what factors might predict partnership success. Traits like warmth, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and trust all seem to matter. But can behavior in childhood predict your future partnering prospects?
In a new study published with my colleagues in Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry we show that children rated by their elementary schoolteachers as being anxious or inattentive were more likely to remain unpartnered from age 18 to 35 years. Children rated as aggressive-oppositional — those who fight, bully and disobey — were more likely to separate and return to unpartnered status. Conversely, prosocial children, who were rated as being kind, helpful and considerate, showed earlier and more sustained partnerships across early adulthood.
The study suggests that the seeds of future partnering patterns are planted early and are visible even before adolescence. This has important implications for children with behavioral difficulties, who already face many life challenges from unemployment to lower earnings. If they can be identified by teachers, then it may be possible to flag them for assessment and support and improve their life chances.
Good partnerships offer many advantages. They provide emotional support, co-parenting opportunities, and socioeconomic security, and can lead to developmental maturation including reduced neuroticism and increased extraversion and self-esteem.
Partnership buffers against the harmful effects of stress, protects against mid-life alcohol and tobacco use, enhances mental health and well-being, and is associated with a healthier, longer life. Although the health benefits may not be entirely causal, since happier, healthier individuals might be “selected” into partnership, they appear to be at least partially causal.
Previous research has shown that childhood psychiatric disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder are associated with future partnership difficulties, including intimate partner violence and lower relationship satisfaction. We were interested in whether common childhood behaviors — including prosocial traits — would predict future partnership stability for children without clinical diagnoses.
Our study was based on analysis of nearly 3,000 Canadian children who were rated by teachers for behaviors like inattention, hyperactivity, aggression, opposition, anxiety, and prosociality at age 10, 11, and 12 years and then followed up into adulthood so we could examine their anonymized tax return records.
Since Canadian tax regulations require people who are married or cohabiting to report this status in their tax returns, we were able to statistically identify groups of participants who followed common patterns of partnering. We then linked them with their earlier behavioral ratings. We controlled for participants’ socioeconomic status because some studies show this can influence partnering patterns.
We found that participants who were predominantly unpartnered from age 18 to 35 years were significantly more likely to have been anxious children, while those who separated early (around age 28 years) and returned to unpartnered status were more likely to have been aggressive-oppositional children. Interestingly, children who were inattentive were more likely to have been in either the unpartnered group or the early separated group.
Participants in the unpartnered and separated groups fared poorly in other ways too: they were more likely to have left high school without a diploma, to have lower earnings, and to be in receipt of welfare support. This raises important questions about what underlying factors might explain the link between childhood behavior and future partnering patterns.
Childhood behavior could influence future partnering directly and indirectly. Behavior is relatively stable across development so a direct influence might be the persistence of childhood behaviors — such as aggression or anxiety — into adulthood, which then influence the capacity to form and sustain stable partnerships.
Studies show that adults who are low in agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability, as measured by the big 5 personality structures, have less satisfying and more tumultuous relationships, and this could undermine relationship stability.
Indirect influences on partnership involve intermediate events, such as employment status or earnings, which have a knock-on effect on accumulation of human capital that contributes to the perceived attractiveness of a partner. For instance, children with disruptive and inattentive behavioral problems typically have fewer friends, under-perform at school, are more likely to abuse substances and to have lower earnings and higher welfare receipt as adults — all of which could undermine their capacity to attract and retain romantic partners as adults.
The finding that prosocial children have more stable and sustained partnerships is perhaps unsurprising. They typically have better peer relations and academic attainment in childhood and higher earnings and perceived attractiveness in adulthood, which should enhance their appeal to prospective partners.
This study should not be understood as a normative argument for partnership, implying that people should be partnered or that “longer is better.” Such decisions are highly personal and depend on individual preferences, life goals, financial circumstances, professional ambitions, and so on.
Rather, we note that most people do wish to partner, and that partnership may confer important health and well-being benefits, so the persistence of early untreated behavioral difficulties should not become an obstacle to establishing stable partnerships in adulthood.
One limitation of this study is that we examined only whether participants were partnered, not the quality of those partnerships. This should be explored in future studies, since children with behavioral problems are likely to have both less stable and less satisfying partnerships.
Successful partnerships are determined by a multitude of individual and contextual factors, and early behaviors are just one piece of the puzzle. Our study shows, once again, that children with behavioral difficulties face many challenges that cascade across their lives, and this includes marginalization from partnership.
Early monitoring and support are crucial and prevention programs that target children’s disruptive, anxious, and inattentive behaviours — and promote social-emotional skills — can produce lasting effects with benefits for individuals, families, and society. After all, there are many reasons to encourage good behavior. – TheConversation/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/us-gives-full-approval-antiviral-remdesivir-treat-covid-19/,US gives full approval to antiviral remdesivir to treat COVID-19,"The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, October 22, granted full approval to the antiviral drug remdesivir as a treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, after conditional authorization was given in May.
Gilead said the drug, sold under the brand name Veklury, was the only specific treatment for COVID-19 approved so far under a more rigorous process.
However, other treatments have received authorization for emergency use, though that approval can be revoked once the public health emergency sparked by the coronavirus pandemic is over.
Other medications, like the steroid dexamethasone, are also being used in the fight against COVID-19.
Gilead’s shares on the New York Stock Exchange jumped 4% soon after the announcement.
“The FDA is committed to expediting the development and availability of COVID-19 treatments during this unprecedented public health emergency,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn.
“Today’s approval is supported by data from multiple clinical trials that the agency has rigorously assessed and represents an important scientific milestone in the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Europe and other countries such as Canada also have granted temporary approval for the use of remdesivir.
Remdesivir, which is administered by an injection, was one of the first drugs to show relative promise in shortening the time to recovery in some coronavirus patients.
But its efficacy in reducing the mortality rate is unproven.
It can be administered to adults and children over the age of 12 who weigh more than 40 kilos (88 pounds) who require hospitalization for the treatment of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
The drug can only be given to patients in a hospital or equivalent setting.
Emergency approval has been granted for its use on pediatric patients under the age of 12 weighing at least 3.5 kilos.
President Donald Trump, who tested positive for the coronavirus early in October, was treated with remdesivir at a military hospital outside Washington, among other drugs.
The drug was first developed to treat Ebola, a viral hemorrhagic fever.
In February, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced it was dusting off remdesivir to investigate against SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes COVID-19, because it had shown promise in animal testing against fellow coronaviruses SARS and MERS.
Its study involving more than 1,000 people, the results of which were released in April, found that patients on the drug had a 31% faster time to recovery than those on a placebo.
Since the medicine is complex to manufacture and is administered via injection, rather than a pill, there have been questions about whether supply could initially be limited.
The United States bet early on remdesivir’s success, rushing to preorder nearly all of Gilead’s summer production.
Gilead has set the price at $390 per vial in developed countries, or $2,340 for 6 vials used over the normal five-day course, though US private insurers will pay $520 per vial.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 23, 2020 9:06 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/convalescent-plasma-shows-limited-effectiveness-for-covid-19/,Convalescent plasma shows ‘limited effectiveness’ for COVID-19 – study,"Plasma taken from the blood of people who have recovered from COVID-19 and given to people sick with the disease does not reduce their chances of getting seriously ill or dying, new research has found.
The findings are from one of the first clinical trials to report the effects of convalescent plasma, which has been given emergency approval in countries including India and the United States.
As a potential treatment for patients with moderate COVID-19, particularly in places where laboratory capacity is limited, the study conducted across India and published in the medical journal BMJ Friday, October 23, concluded that “convalescent plasma showed limited effectiveness.”
But the researchers said future studies could explore using only plasma with high levels of neutralizing antibodies to see if this might be more effective.
With few useful treatments and no cure or vaccine, nations are scrambling to find ways to blunt the severity of the new coronavirus.
One idea has been to harvest recovered patients’ antibodies, which float in plasma – the liquid component of blood – and then inject this into the blood of someone fighting infection.
The technique was first tried against diphtheria in 1892 and was shown to help speed recovery from Ebola and SARS, which is caused by the same family of pathogens as the novel coronavirus.
Observational studies recently carried out suggested convalescent plasma could be beneficial.
But in a randomized clinical trial at dozens of public and private hospitals across India, researchers found that it failed to reduce mortality or stop progression to severe COVID-19 in moderately ill patients.
The study, funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research, enrolled 464 adult patients, with an average age of 52, between April and July and split them randomly into two groups.
A control group of 229 was given the normal best standard of hospital care, while 235 people received two transfusions of convalescent plasma and were then given the best standard of hospital care.
After 28 days, 44 (19%) of the participants in the plasma group and 41 (18%) in the control group progressed to severe disease or died from any cause.
When they restricted the comparison to patients who received plasma with detectable levels of antibodies, the results were the same, the authors said.
They did however find that the use of convalescent plasma seemed to improve resolution of shortness of breath and fatigue and led to higher conversion to a negative result for the virus – a sign of it being neutralized by antibodies – after 7 days.
The trial “was a rigorous randomized controlled study on a topic of enormous global importance” said public health scientist Elizabeth Pathak in a separate commentary also published in the BMJ.
But the results were greeted with caution by a spokesman from Britain’s National Health Service, which is also in the process of carrying out large, randomized control trials of convalescent plasma.
A spokesman from the NHS blood and transplant department said that the Indian trial had used donations with antibody levels around 6 to 10 times lower than in Britain.
“There is other promising evidence that convalescent plasma transfusions with high antibody levels could improve patient outcomes,” the spokesman said, adding that results from trials with these higher levels of antibodies “should provide clear answers.”",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 23, 2020 8:09 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/india-to-roll-out-quick-and-cheap-coronavirus-paper-test/,India to roll out quick and cheap coronavirus paper test,"A fast and cheap paper-based coronavirus test will soon be available across India, with scientists hopeful it will help turn the tide on the pandemic in one of the world’s worst-hit nations.
India has recorded more than 7.5 million infections, second only to the United States, and the outbreak has spread from densely packed megacities like Mumbai to rural communities with limited medical services.
The locally developed Feluda, named for a detective in a famous Indian novel series, resembles a home pregnancy paper-strip test and delivers results within an hour.
Researchers are optimistic that its low cost and ease of use can help stem the pathogen’s spread in poor and remote areas.
“This test doesn’t require any sophisticated equipment or highly trained manpower,” said co-creator Souvik Maiti, a scientist at New Delhi’s CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB).
“There are lots of remote parts of India where you do not have any sophisticated laboratories… (The test) will be much easier to deploy; it will have much more penetration.”
India currently diagnoses COVID-19 with either RT-PCR tests, which are highly accurate but require advanced lab machinery, or antigen tests, which can give results in just a few minutes at a limited cost but with significantly lower accuracy.
Feluda, like other inexpensive paper-based tests being developed in other countries, claims to combine the accuracy of the PCR test with the accessibility of the antigen kits.
It uses the gene-editing technique CRISPR-Cas9, which recently earned its inventors Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
Feluda has been granted government regulatory approval and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said last week it could be rolled out in the next few weeks by Indian conglomerate Tata Group.
If made available within that timeframe, India will be one of the first countries in the world to begin mass use of such a test.
The price has not been released, but local media said it could cost around 500 rupees ($6.80) – around a fifth of what a PCR test costs in New Delhi.
The current prototype requires a PCR machine for processing, but scientists are working on a saliva or self-swabbing version that can be used at home, co-founder and IGIB scientist Debojyoti Chakraborty said.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 22, 2020 12:55 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/europe/spain-first-eu-nation-million-virus-cases/,Spain becomes first EU nation with 1 million virus cases,"Spain has become the first European Union nation to record a million coronavirus infections, official data showed on Wednesday, October 21, as the government mulled fresh restrictions on public life to curb the spread of the disease.
The country recorded 16,973 confirmed cases of COVID-19 over the past 24 hours, the health ministry announced, taking the total to 1,005,295 since its first case was diagnosed on January 31 on the remote island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands.
Of this number, 34,366 people have died, with 156 more deaths were recorded in the previous 24 hours.
Spain, which is home to around 47 million people, is only the sixth country in the world to cross this grim milestone after the United States, India, Brazil, Russia, and Argentina, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
The new wave of contagion has been less deadly than in late March and April, when fatalities routinely exceeded 800 per day, as the median age of new infections has dropped.
But with healthcare workers warning the spike could once again overwhelm hospitals, health minister Salvador Illa said on Tuesday the government was considering several new measures, including nighttime curfews such as those recently put in place in France and Belgium.
“We are facing very tough weeks ahead, winter is coming, the second wave is no longer a threat, it is a reality across Europe,” he told a news conference, adding the government was “open to everything” to contain the virus.
The health ministry is set to meet on Thursday with representatives from Spain’s powerful regional governments, who are in charge of health care, to update the country’s plan to respond to the pandemic.
Spain was one of the worst-affected countries when the coronavirus struck Europe early this year before one of the world’s most stringent lockdowns helped reduce the outbreak’s spread.
But infections have surged since the lockdown measures were fully removed at the end of June, with the rise blamed on the rapid return of nightlife and a lack of an efficient system to track and trace infections.
Messy disagreements between the central and regional governments, and between political parties, over what measures to take have also hampered the response, experts say.
“The pandemic has been used as a political weapon to fight and argue with your adversaries instead of trying to find a middle ground and the best solution for everyone,” Salvador Macip, an expert in health sciences at Catalonia’s Open University who has written a book called “The Great Modern Plagues,” told AFP.
As infections have picked up, Spanish regional authorities started imposing fresh restrictions.
Madrid and several satellite cities have since early October been under a partial lockdown, while the wealthy northeastern region of Catalonia has imposed a 15-day shutdown of all bars and restaurants.
The northern wine-growing region of La Rioja announced Wednesday it would close its regional borders while the northeastern region of Aragon said it would impose a partial lockdown on its three biggest cities – Huesca, Teruel, and Zaragoza.
Angela Hernandez Puente, a doctor and the deputy secretary of Madrid’s Amtys medical association, said the situation was very worrying, but not comparable with the overwhelming pressure the health system came under in March when intensive care units were full and staff lacked personal protective equipment.
But she said the gains of Spain’s tough lockdown were wasted due to a lack of preparation for a second wave of infections, citing as an example the failure to hire more doctors for public primary care centres, the first line of defence against the virus as they handle testing and tracing potential cases as well as treating the sick.
“Healthcare staff are tired and angry, many doctors feel that more should have been done in June, July, and August to not let the public health system become overburdened as it is now,” she told AFP.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 22, 2020 11:01 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/volunteer-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-test-dies-brazil/,Volunteer in Oxford COVID-19 vaccine test dies in Brazil – officials,"A volunteer participating in clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University has died in Brazil, officials announced Wednesday, October 21, though media reports said he had received a placebo, not the test vaccine.
It is the first death reported in the various coronavirus vaccine trials taking place worldwide.
However, organizers of the study said an independent review had concluded there were no safety concerns and that testing of the vaccine, developed with pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, would continue.
Media reports said the volunteer was a 28-year-old doctor working on the front lines of the pandemic who died of complications from COVID-19.
Brazilian newspaper Globo and international news agency Bloomberg said he was in the control group and had received a placebo rather than the test vaccine, citing sources close to the trials.
“Following careful assessment of this case in Brazil, there have been no concerns about safety of the clinical trial, and the independent review in addition to the Brazilian regulator have recommended that the trial should continue,” Oxford said in a statement.
AstraZeneca said medical confidentiality meant it could not give details on any individual volunteer, but that independent review had “not led to any concerns about continuation of the ongoing study.”
Brazil’s national health regulator, Anvisa, confirmed it had been notified of the case on October 19.
The D’Or Teaching and Research Institute (IDOR), which is helping organize the tests in Brazil, said the independent review had “raised no doubts about the safety of the study, and recommended it continue.”
Oxford and AstraZeneca previously had to suspend testing of the vaccine in September when a volunteer in Britain developed an unexplained illness.
Trials resumed after British regulators and an independent review concluded the illness was not a side effect of the vaccine.
Half the volunteers in the final-stage clinical trial – a double-blind, randomized, controlled study – receive a placebo, IDOR said.
Around 8,000 volunteers have been vaccinated so far in Brazil, and more than 20,000 worldwide, it said.
Study participants must be doctors, nurses, or other health sector workers who come into regular contact with the virus.
The deceased volunteer was a young doctor who had been treating COVID-19 patients since March in the emergency rooms and intensive care units at two hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Globo said.
He graduated from medical school last year, and was in good health prior to contracting the disease, family and friends told the newspaper.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 22, 2020 10:52 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/vaccine-trials-cannot-detect-virus-risk-reduction/,Vaccine trials ‘can’t detect’ virus risk reduction – expert,"None of the trials of COVID-19 candidate vaccines can detect a reduction in serious outcomes such as hospitalization or death, a leading public health expert said Thursday, October 22.
Writing in the BMJ medical journal, associate editor Peter Doshi warned that not even phase 3 trials under way in the race for a vaccine can prove their product will prevent people contracting COVID-19.
In a sobering essay, Doshi said those hoping for a breakthrough to end the pandemic would be disappointed, with some vaccines likely to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection by only 30%.
“None of the trials currently under way are designed to detect a reduction in any serious outcome such as hospital admissions, use of intensive care, or deaths,” he wrote.
“Nor are the vaccines being studied to determine whether they can interrupt transmission of the virus.”
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 42 candidate vaccines in clinical trials, 10 of which are in the most advanced “phase 3” stage.
This is where a vaccine’s effectiveness is tested on a large scale, generally tens of thousands of people across several continents.
But Doshi, assistant professor of pharmaceutical health services research at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, said that even the most advanced trials are evaluating mild rather than severe disease.
This may be down to the numbers of people involved in trials, he said, pointing out that the majority of confirmed COVID-19 infections involve mild or no symptoms.
And few if any current trials are designed to find out whether there is a benefit among the elderly, a key at-risk constituency.
Without enrolling frail and elderly volunteers in trials in sufficient numbers, Doshi said “there can be little basis for assuming any benefit against hospitalization or mortality.
He added that children, immunocompromised people, and pregnant women had largely been excluded from trials, making it unlikely that the experiments will address key gaps in our understanding of how COVID-19 develops differently among individuals.
Several trials have already been halted after participants became ill.
Many countries plan to prioritize vulnerable people once a vaccine is available, but Doshi said that those hoping for a miracle end to the pandemic would have to wait.
He said that several pharmaceutical firms had designed their studies “to detect a relative risk reduction of at least 30% in participants developing laboratory confirmed COVID-19.”
Recent studies have also confirmed that it is possible for someone to be reinfected with COVID-19, a development that may impact how governments’ form their vaccination plans.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 22, 2020 10:28 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/uk-researchers-aim-infect-volunteers-study-covid-exposure/,UK researchers aim to infect volunteers to study COVID exposure,"British researchers on Tuesday, October 20, said they hope to expose healthy volunteers to the virus that causes COVID-19 in a groundbreaking study to discover the amount needed for people to become infected.
The Human Challenge Program – a partnership that includes Imperial College London – hopes the work will ultimately help to “reduce the spread of the coronavirus, mitigate its impact and reduce deaths.”
In what researchers called a world first, the opening stage of the project will examine the possibility of exposing healthy volunteers to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
They aim to recruit volunteers between the ages of 18 and 30 with no underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, or obesity.
“In this initial phase, the aim will be to discover the smallest amount of virus it takes to cause a person to develop Covid-19,” Imperial College said in a statement.
The volunteer would be infected via the nose, Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial, told BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday.
“The great advantage of these volunteer studies is that we can look at each volunteer very carefully not only during the infection but also prior to infection, and we can work out exactly what’s going on at every stage,” he added.
The researchers would use the results to study how vaccines might work and to explore potential treatments.
Because the study deliberately infects the volunteers, “it should be possible for scientists to begin to establish efficacy very quickly, by testing if those who have had a vaccine are less likely to become infected with the virus,” explained the researchers.
“Our number one priority is the safety of the volunteers,” said Chris Chiu, from Imperial’s department of infectious disease.
“No study is completely risk free, but the Human Challenge Program partners will be working hard to ensure we make the risks as low as we possibly can.”
“The UK’s experience and expertise in human challenge trials as well as in wider COVID-19 science will help us tackle the pandemic, benefiting people in the UK and worldwide,” he added.
The study is expected to begin early next year, said the research team from the partnership, which also includes the government, a clinical company and a hospital.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 20, 2020 5:42 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/un-stockpiling-billion-syringes-covid-19-vaccine/,UN stockpiling 1 billion syringes for COVID-19 vaccine,"The United Nations said Monday, October 19, it would stockpile one billion syringes around the world by the end of 2021, to be used for the delivery of any future coronavirus vaccine.
UNICEF, the UN Children’s Fund, said it aims to get 520 million syringes in its warehouses by the end of this year, to guarantee an initial supply in countries ahead of the vaccine.
“The world will need as many syringes as doses of vaccine,” UNICEF said in a statement.
UNICEF said it was also buying 5 million safety boxes for used syringes.
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide passed 40 million on Monday, according to an AFP tally based on official sources. More than 1.1 million deaths have been recorded across the globe.
“Vaccinating the world against COVID-19 will be one of the largest mass undertakings in human history, and we will need to move as quickly as the vaccines can be produced,” said UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore.
“By the end of the year, we will already have over half a billion syringes pre-positioned where they can be deployed quickly and cost effectively.”
The syringes will be used by Covax, the international coronavirus vaccine procurement, production and distribution pool created by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Covax is run by the Gavi vaccine alliance, which will reimburse UNICEF for the syringes.
A public-private partnership, Gavi helps vaccinate half the world’s children against some of the deadliest diseases on the planet.
Syringes have a five-year shelf life and tend to be shipped by sea, rather than vaccines, which are heat-sensitive and transported more quickly by air freight.
The billion syringes come on top of the 620 million that UNICEF would purchase for other vaccination programs against diseases such as measles and typhoid.
The WHO says 42 vaccine candidates are currently being tested on humans, of which 10 have reached the mass testing third and final stage.
A further 156 are being worked on in laboratories in preparation for human testing.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/enforce-quarantine-crush-pandemic-who/,"Enforce quarantine to crush pandemic, says WHO","Contacts of people confirmed to have coronavirus should be properly quarantined, the World Health Organization said on Monday, October 19, as the pandemic surges in Europe and North America.
WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan linked soaring transmission rates in the northern hemisphere to the failure to implement the vital step rigorously.
He said if he could have one wish, it would be to ensure “every contact of a confirmed case is in quarantine for the appropriate period.”
“I do not believe that has occurred systematically, anywhere,” he told a virtual press conference from the WHO’s headquarters in Geneva, saying it was “a good part of the reason why we’re seeing such high numbers.”
Ryan said that about half of the 48 countries in the UN health agency’s European region had seen roughly 50% increases in cases within the past week – and hospitalizations and death rates were beginning to track those rises.
However, there was hope that deaths and serious cases would not reach the levels seen earlier this year.
Ryan said the average age of sufferers was now much younger, treatment had improved and those infected may have been exposed to lower doses of the virus because of physical distancing and mask wearing.
The tally of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide passed 40 million on Monday, with more than 1.1 million deaths.
WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned against people getting fed up with the pandemic and the measures imposed to control it.
“We’re in this for the long haul, but there is hope that if we make smart choices together, we can keep cases down,” he said.
“I know there is a fatigue but the virus has shown that when we let our guard down, it can surge back at breakneck speed and threaten hospitals and health systems.”
The WHO says 42 potential vaccines are now being tested on humans, of which 10 have reached the third and final stage.
A further 156 are being worked on in laboratories with a view to human testing.
Typically, only around one in 10 candidate drugs make it through the trials.
WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said that while one or two trials may report data by the end of the year, most would start to do so in early 2021.
High-risk groups across all countries would get the first doses, probably in mid-2021, she said.
“There are some of the vaccines, certainly, that are showing promising results even amongst older people,” Swaminathan said, referring to drugs that have completed second-stage tests.

The pathogen that causes the flu survives on human skin for about 1.8 hours by comparison, said the study published this month in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal.
“The nine-hour survival of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus strain that causes COVID-19) on human skin may increase the risk of contact transmission in comparison with IAV (influenza A virus), thus accelerating the pandemic,” it said.
The research team tested skin collected from autopsy specimens, about one day after death.
Both the coronavirus and the flu virus are inactivated within 15 seconds by applying ethanol, which is used in hand sanitizers.
“The longer survival of SARS-CoV-2 on the skin increases contact-transmission risk; however, hand hygiene can reduce this risk,” the study said.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-is-right-other-essential-covid-19-strategies/,"WHO is right: Lockdowns should be short, sharp. Here are 4 other essential COVID-19 strategies","Last week the World Health Organization’s special envoy on COVID-19, David Nabarro, said:
This has created confusion and frustration, as many people have interpreted this as running counter to WHO’s previous advice on dealing with the pandemic. Haven’t most of us spent some or most of the past few months living in a world of lockdowns and severe restrictions, based on advice from the WHO?
Dig a little deeper, however, and these comments are not as contrary as they might seem. They merely make explicit the idea that lockdowns are just one of many different weapons we can deploy against the coronavirus.
Lockdowns are a good tactic in situations where transmission is spiralling out of control and there is a threat of the health system being overwhelmed. As Nabarro says, they can “buy you time to reorganise, regroup, rebalance your resources”.
But they should not be used as the main strategy against COVID-19 more broadly. And the decision to impose a lockdown should be considered carefully, with the benefits weighed against the often very significant consequences.
Lockdowns also have a disproportionate impact on the most disadvantaged people in society. This cost is greater still in poorer countries, where not going to work can mean literally having no food to eat.
Read more: Is lockdown worth the pain? No, it’s a sledgehammer and we have better options
So if lockdowns are best used as a short, sharp measure to stop the coronavirus running rampant, what other strategies should we be focusing on to control the spread of COVID-19 more generally? Here are 4 key tactics.
The key pillars in the public health response to this pandemic have always been testing, contract tracing, and isolating cases. This has been the clear message from the WHO from the beginning, and every jurisdiction that has enjoyed success in controlling the virus has excelled in these 3 interlinked tasks.
No one disputes the importance of being able to identify cases and make sure they don’t spread the virus. When we identify cases, we also need to work out where and by whom they were infected, so we can quarantine anyone who may also have been exposed. The goal here is to interrupt transmission of the virus by keeping the infected away from others.
Time is of the essence. People should be tested as soon as they develop symptoms, and should isolate immediately until they know they are in the clear. For positive cases, contact tracing should be done as quickly as possible. All of this helps limit the virus’s spread.
Responding to disease clusters in an effective, timely manner is also vitally important. We’ve all seen how certain environments, such as aged-care homes, can become breeding grounds for infections, and how hard it is to control these clusters once they gain momentum.
Bringing clusters under control requires decisive action, and countries that have been successful in combating the virus have used a range of strategies to do it. Vietnam, which has been lauded for its coronavirus response despite its large population and lack of resources, has worked hard to “box in the virus” when clusters were identified. This involved identifying and testing people up to 3 degrees of separation from a known case.
Read more: Europe’s second wave is worse than the first. What went so wrong, and what can it learn from countries like Vietnam?
Another crucial element of a successful coronavirus response is giving the public clear advice on how to protect themselves. Public buy-in is vital, because ultimately it is the behavior of individuals that has the biggest influence on the virus’s spread.
Everyone in the community should understand the importance of social distancing and good hygiene. This includes non-English speakers and other minority groups. Delivering this message to all members of the community requires money and effort from health authorities and community leaders.
After some confusion at the beginning of the pandemic, it is now almost universally accepted that public mask-wearing is a cheap and effective way to slow disease transmission, particularly in situations where social distancing is difficult.
As a result, masks — although unduly politicized in some quarters — have been rapidly accepted in many societies that weren’t previously used to wearing them. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/flu-shot-misinformation-spreads/,"As US battles COVID-19, flu shot misinformation spreads","US health officials are pushing Americans to get vaccinated against the flu to help prevent hospitals already busy battling COVID-19 from being overwhelmed this winter, but false claims are threatening their efforts.
Misinformation on social media, particularly that a flu shot will increase the risk of contracting the coronavirus or cause you to test positive for COVID-19 – it won’t – is undermining the public health message.
One false claim circulating on Facebook and Instagram said a flu shot would raise the probability of COVID-19 infection by 36 percent. Another on Instagram said Sanofi’s flu vaccine Fluzone was 2.4 times more deadly than COVID-19.
A national study from the University of Michigan found that one in three parents planned to skip the flu vaccine for their children this year, with mothers and fathers pointing to misinformation, including the belief that it is not effective, as a reason.
“Primary care providers have a really important role to play in this flu season,” said Sarah Clark, research scientist at the Michigan Medicine Child Health Evaluation and Research Center, who led the study.
“They need to send parents a clear and strong message about the importance of flu vaccine.”
But with daily COVID-19 infections rising to record levels in several US states, false information remains a barrier to people getting vaccinated.
Jeanine Guidry, an assistant professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who studies health messaging on social media, said: “There is so much misinformation related to COVID and I really believe that that spills over” to the flu.
Amelia Jamison, a misinformation researcher and doctoral student at Johns Hopkins University, agreed.
“Flu is getting caught up in some of the narratives we see about coronavirus,” she said.
According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), only 49.2% of people got a flu vaccine during the 2018-19 season.
Aside from misinformation, measures aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19 resulted in fewer in-person preventive medical visits, during which many receive the vaccine. And other flu shot clinics typically offered by employers, churches or schools have been on hold.
High unemployment due to the economic fallout of the pandemic has also left millions of Americans without health insurance, meaning states will need to pick up the vaccine cost for more patients.
While the effectiveness of the flu shot can vary depending on whether the strain of flu circulating in communities matches the strain in the vaccine, the CDC said it prevents millions of illnesses each year.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the vaccine for all children over the age of 6 months.
Flu vaccine expert Danuta Skowronski, of the British Columbia Center for Disease Control, said: “We saw no association in children nor in adults between the receipt of influenza vaccine and coronavirus risk.”
While social media platforms host misinformation, they also take actions to spread reliable guidance about vaccines.
This week, Facebook announced it would start directing US users to information about where they can get a flu shot, and promised to reject ads that discourage vaccination.
Prior to the pandemic, Twitter and Pinterest put in place policies to redirect searches of certain vaccine-related keywords to public health organizations.
But Adam Dunn, head of Biomedical Informatics and Digital Health at The University of Sydney, said more can be done.
Methods developed to encourage user engagement on social media “could be used more judiciously to guide people to credible and evidence-based information,” Dunn said.
He also advocated for the creation of more “communities of pro-vaccine advocacy that are welcoming, honest, and aligned with a diversity of worldviews.”
Libby Richards, associate professor at the Purdue School of Nursing, said that “a flu shot is more important than ever this year,” cautioning that severe cases of Covid-19 and the flu require the same life saving equipment.
“Receiving the flu vaccine will not only provide personal health protection, it will also help reduce the burden of respiratory illness on our already very overstretched healthcare system.”
Richards encouraged people to take the time to fact-check information.
“There are many myths about the flu vaccine that can clearly be disproved with a little background reading,” she said.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 17, 2020 10:10 AM PHT"

Remdesivir, which was part of the experimental cocktail given to US President Donald Trump when he caught the new coronavirus last month, was one of several reviewed in a large study of more than 11,000 people across 30 countries.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-vaccine-explainer-updates/,The race for a COVID-19 vaccine heats up,"Dozens of companies, from biotech start-ups to Big Pharma, are racing to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, because the world needs it and for the potential pay day.
Here’s an update on the quest for a magic bullet against the coronavirus that has already killed more than a million people worldwide.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 42 “candidate vaccines” at the stage of clinical trials, up from 11 in mid-June.
Ten of them are at the most advanced “phase 3” stage, in which a vaccine’s effectiveness is tested on a large scale, generally tens of thousands of people across several continents.
US biotech firm Moderna, a US-German collaboration between BioNTech and Pfizer, several state-run Chinese labs, and a European project led by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca are thought to be among the more promising. Russia has already registered two COVID-19 vaccines, even before clinical trials were completed.
US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer said on Friday it would apply for emergency authorization in the United States for its vaccine in late November if safety data pans out.
Other clinical trials are still in phase 1 or 2, while another 156 are in pre-clinical stages of development.
Some methods for making a vaccine are tried-and-true, while others remain experimental.
Inactivated “classic” vaccines use a virus germ that has been killed while others use a weakened or “attenuated” strain that is virulent enough to provoke antibodies but not to cause disease.
So-called “sub-unit” vaccines contain a fragment of the pathogen that it is derived from to produce an appropriate immune response.
“Viral vector” varieties use other forms of live virus to deliver DNA into human cells, triggering an immune response.
A measles virus modified with a coronavirus protein, for example, can be deployed against COVID-19.
There are also experimental gene-based vaccines using DNA or RNA fragments.
To date, only the result of phase 1 and 2 trials have been published in peer-reviewed medical journals.
On Friday, preliminary results showing that a vaccine developed by Chinese firm Sinopharm provoked an immune response were published in The Lancet.
Similar studies in recent weeks have reported on one of the Russian vaccines, along with those from the University of Oxford, Chinese company CanSino, and Moderna.
While encouraging, it is too soon to say whether these vaccines will pan out. Trials of two candidate vaccines – made by Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly – were “paused” recently over safety concerns.
But that is not necessarily bad news, said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
“The fact that trials are paused should indicate that there should be confidence that the whole process of monitoring the safety of trial participants is working well,” he said.
Recent cases in which recovered COVID patients were infected a second time with a new strain also raise the question of how long vaccines might last.
Companies backed by their governments in China, Russia and the United States are racing to be the first across the finish line.
In early August Russian President Vladimir Putin declared victory, announcing the roll-out of the Sputnik V vaccine before phase 3 trials had begun.
But there were few takers outside of Russia, and experts dismissed the announcement as premature.
Donald Trump has promised a vaccine before the November 3 election, but it is unlikely he will be able to deliver.
Earlier this month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it would need to see two months of follow up data after vaccination before giving emergency authorisation for use.
And on Friday, Pfizer said its vaccine wouldn’t be ready until mid-November.
“What is different for COVID-19 vaccines is that speed of development and potential approval is much faster due to the public health emergency,” noted the European Medicines Agency.
But even that pressing need cannot overcome the rules.
“Before approval, all vaccines in the European Union are evaluated against the same high standards as any other medicine,” the Agency said in a statement.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 17, 2020 9:21 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/russia-registers-new-covid-19-vaccine-as-cases-hit-record-high/,Russia registers new COVID-19 vaccine as cases hit record high,"President Vladimir Putin announced on Wednesday, October 14, that Russia has registered its second coronavirus vaccine, while the country reported a record number of new infections.
“The Novosibirsk Vektor center today registered the second Russian vaccine against coronavirus – EpiVacCorona,” Putin said during a video conference with cabinet members.
Vektor, a top-secret laboratory in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, conducted biological weapons research in the Soviet era and stockpiles viruses ranging from Ebola to smallpox.
Putin’s announcement came after he said in August that the country had registered its first coronavirus vaccine called Sputnik V, which is yet to complete its final stage of testing.
The new vaccine triggers an immune response using synthetic virus proteins, while Sputnik V uses adapted adenovirus strains, a virus that causes the common cold.
Deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova said during the conference with Putin that the vaccine showed a “fairly high level of safety.”
It will now move onto post-registration trials involving some 40,000 volunteers, she added.
Russian officials in recent weeks have recorded a sharp rise in infections and a government tally on Wednesday registered a new record increase in infections, with 14,231 new cases.
Golikova described the virus situation in the country as “controlled” and said no further measures were needed.
On Tuesday, October 13, deputy health minister Oleg Gridnev raised concerns that 90% of Russia’s hospital beds set aside to treat coronavirus patients were already occupied.
In Moscow – the worst-hit city by far – residents over the age of 65 have been asked to stay at home.
Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin last week urged all Muscovites to limit their movements until a vaccine is available for mass distribution.
At the start of the pandemic, Russia imposed sweeping restrictions which were lifted ahead of a vote in June on constitutional amendments which could see Putin stay in power until 2036.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-report-coronavirus-threatens-reverse-progress-tb-fight/,Coronavirus threatens to reverse progress in TB fight – WHO,"The novel coronavirus pandemic threatens to reverse progress towards eliminating tuberculosis, until now the top infectious disease killer globally, the World Health Organization warned Wednesday, October 14.
The countries hit hard by tuberculosis such as India and South Africa have seen resources usually allocated to diagnosing and treating TB diverted to fighting coronavirus, the WHO said.
The report estimated that TB could cause this year between 200,000 and 400,000 more deaths than the 1.4 million last year, even though remedies exist.
“The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to unwind the gains made over recent years,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
“The impact of the pandemic on TB services has been severe. Data collated by WHO from high TB burden countries show sharp drops in TB notifications in 2020,” he said.
In India alone, weekly and monthly notifications plunged by 50% from the end of March to end of April following a lockdown in the country, which has the highest number of cases in the world, the report said.
A similar trend, it said, was observed in South Africa between March and June.
The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders said it was “disheartening” to see that the world’s governments are not on track to reach the testing and treatment goals for TB.
“With COVID-19 causing backtracking on TB testing, governments need to come up with a catch-up plan. Time’s up for excuses,” the group’s TB policy advisor, Sharonan Lynch, said.
Beyond the lockdown, which makes patient care difficult, WHO said the COVID-19 pandemic is also drawing away medical staff as well as financial and technical resources.
Already in early May, the WHO’s department to halt tuberculosis estimated that 3 months of lockdown could lead to 6 million new infections and 1.4 million extra TB deaths between 2020 and 2025.
TB is caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which affects the lungs and is spread when sick people expel bacteria into the air, by coughing, for example.
When a person is in good health, the infection has often no symptoms as the immune system “imprisons” the bacillus, WHO said.
When people are ill with TB, symptoms include coughing, often with blood in their sputum, chest pains, weight loss and perspiration at night.
TB can be treated with antibiotics for several months and the WHO estimates that diagnosis and treatment have helped save 58 million people between 2000 and 2018.
Until now the top infectious disease killer, TB is also among the top ten causes of death worldwide, notably because symptoms can remain hidden for months.
Though tuberculosis is worldwide, more than 95% of the cases and deaths occur in developing countries.
In 2019, 44% of the cases were recorded in southeast Asia, 25% in Africa, 18% in the western Pacific and 8.2% in the east Mediterranean. The Americas accounted for 2.9% and Europe 2.5%.
But 8 countries accounted for two thirds of new cases: India, Indonesia, China, Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and South Africa.
Only 78 countries were in line before the pandemic to meet the goals to reduce the number of cases in 2020.
The disease infected some 10 million extra people last year, a slight decrease over prior years, the WHO said.
Last year around 1.4 million died of it, including 208,000 who were infected with HIV, which also marks a decline.
WHO said the decreases are still not fast enough to meet the goals set for the end of 2020 as part of a strategy to eliminate tuberculosis by 2030.
At least 1,087,513 people have died of the coronavirus since it emerged in China late in 2019, according to an Agence France-Presse tally on Wednesday.
At least 38.2 million cases have been recorded around the world.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 14, 2020 11:32 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/why-males-may-have-worse-response-covid-19/,Why males may have a worse response to COVID-19,"If you ask most women about how their male relatives, partners and friends respond to being sick, they’ll often tell you with an accompanying eye roll, “He’s such a baby.” “He’s extra whiny.” Or “he exaggerates so much.” But there may be a biological explanation for this behavior.
Dubbed the “man flu,” this phenomenon has been validated in a review of previously published, large epidemiological studies, as well as in studies of influenza in animals. In these studies, males were sick longer, with more severe symptoms and had a weaker response to vaccination. Laboratory tests with animals infected with the influenza virus also underscore that there are sex-based differences in immune response that influence outcomes observed in humans. But are these more severe symptoms and outcomes unique to cold and flu?
As a respiratory toxicologist and researcher investigating sex differences in the respiratory system, I was intrigued to read a recent study on sex-specific responses to COVID-19 that suggest that men are, actually, more vulnerable and suffer more from this disease.
These findings may apply to other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. For example, reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection rates are similar between males and females, but male sex is a significant risk factor for more serious COVID-19 disease and death. In fact, one study revealed that men are 2.4 times more likely to die from COVID-19. I find it interesting that higher death rates in men also occurred in other coronavirus diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome, caused by SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome.
Based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of Oct. 5, 2020, the risk of death from COVID-19 in men 30-49 years old was also found to be more than twice that of females.
In other age groups, the risk of COVID-19-related death in males was also higher than the same female age cohort. But it was not as high as in the 30- to 49-year-old age group.
This contrasts with almost equal rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in those same age groups, leading scientists to wonder why might males be more susceptible.
The recent report published in Nature explores how males and females respond differently to COVID-19.
This study examined samples including nasal swabs, saliva, and blood, which were either collected from healthy individuals or COVID-19 patients. These samples were used to better understand what the immune response to the infection looks like and how it differs in people with more severe disease.
Similar to CDC data on infection rates, no sex difference in the concentration of virus or the amount of virus present was observed in either the nasal swab or the saliva. There were also no differences in antibody levels – a signal the body had identified the virus – detected in infected men and women.
However, the authors identified major sex differences during the early immune response that occurs soon after someone is infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The blood samples were analyzed for a variety of cytokines – some of the first signaling molecules that help immune cells respond to pathogens. The levels of these signals rise and fall to provide an adequate response to fight an invading pathogen. But large quantities of these molecules can severely damage the body. This is the case in a cytokine storm.
The authors of the Nature report observed sex differences in the strength of the cytokine response. Men showed higher levels of cytokines that trigger inflammation, like IL-8 and IL-18, than women. Higher quantities of these cytokines are linked to more severe disease. In severe cases of COVID-19, fluid builds up in the lungs, reducing the oxygen available in the body for normal functions. This can lead to tissue damage, shock and potentially the failure of multiple organs.
In addition to sex differences in cytokine levels, the authors also found sex differences in the function of immune cells.
Compared to men, women had a higher number of T cells – essential for eliminating the virus – that were activated, primed and ready to respond to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Men with lower levels of these activated T-cells were more likely to have severe disease.
Thus, there are several aspects of the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 that differ between men and women. Understanding these differences can inform how doctors treat patients and can help researchers develop sex-specific therapies.
These results contradict speculation that male susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is due to more risky behaviors. Those include downplaying the seriousness of the virus, joining large gatherings and ignoring social distancing guidelines, as well as lower rates of hand-washing and wearing masks. Instead, rates of infection are actually similar between males and females, while males are more at risk of serious COVI9-19 disease, suggesting biological differences in response to infection.
This paper is one of the first of its kind to delve into mechanisms of susceptibility sex differences. With greater innate biological risk for severe disease and death in men, this suggests that males might need to be hypervigilant about social distancing, hand-washing and mask-wearing.
Greater adherence to infection prevention protections, especially in men, would not only reduce their risk of infection, but also combat their increased risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19.
The take-home message of this new paper is that researchers need to consider strategies to ensure treatments and vaccines are equally effective for both women and men, especially when one is more susceptible than another. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-reinfections-possible-should-we-worry/,COVID-19 reinfections are possible. Should we worry?,"The patient walked into the Washoe County community testing station in the US state of Nevada on April 18 with a sore throat, dry cough, and a headache, but no reason to worry.
He was only 25, had no prior medical conditions, and although the PCR nasal-swab test for COVID-19 he took came back positive, he was soon feeling well again.
Thirty-five days later, he was rushed to the emergency room, short of breath and with a raging fever, and placed on oxygen support.
He had become the first confirmed US case of COVID-19 reinfection.
Up to now, there have been only a handful of similar cases worldwide, and experts say it is too early to draw sweeping conclusions from such a small head count.
But the prospect of getting reinfected with COVID-19 – and getting even sicker the second time around – could have a significant impact on how governments chart the path out of the pandemic.
In particular, reinfections may render the idea of herd immunity – that is, a sufficiently high percentage of people eventually becoming immune to COVID-19 – unrealistic.
“Reinfection cases mean that in some people, the immune response is not enough to protect them from infection or disease,” Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of Immunobiology and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology at Yale University, told AFP.
“Reinfections from SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) mean that immunity acquired through natural infection is not perfect.”
Researchers who documented the Nevada patient’s case offered a number of possible explanations as to how he could have gotten sick twice.
He may have been exposed to a very high dose of the virus the second time around, triggering a more acute reaction.
Alternatively, it may have been a more virulent strain of the virus.
The study, published this week in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, listed other confirmed reinfections in Belgium, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Ecuador.
Frederic Altare, director of Immunology at the Inserm Research Center of Oncology and Immunology Nantes-Angers, said there was currently little evidence that COVID-19 reinfection was going to be a “major issue” given the low case figures.
“With the number of people who have been infected there are only a dozen or so proven reinfections – that’s not much,” he told AFP.
But others said it was difficult to accurately gauge reinfection numbers given the relative lack of testing during the first wave this spring.
In other words, many people could have in theory been infected in March or April and remained asymptomatic, only to test positive later in the year when they were reinfected, but this time with symptoms.
According to Jeffrey Shaman, professor of Environmental Health Sciences at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, the main obstacle to ascertaining reinfection numbers is that SARS-CoV-2 – unlike other coronaviruses that circulate among humans – is brand new, epidemiologically speaking.
“The world has only been dealing with this for a number of months,” he told AFP.
“We don’t know if (reinfection) is going to be common or as likely to be equally severe as the initial infection.
“It’s really important to understand what this virus is ultimately going to do and how challenging it’s going to be to make a universal vaccine,” Shaman said.
While it is hard to say for certain how widespread or frequent COVID-19 reinfections will end up being, scientists can look to similar viruses for clues.
Lia van der Hoek, an expert on coronaviruses at Amsterdam UMC, has studied the pathogens for decades.
She was the lead author on a paper published last month in Nature Medicine investigating the 4 other coronaviruses that humans can catch.
The study charted 10 healthy individuals over the course of more than 30 years, and found that patients were infected multiple times with the virus.
One patient was infected on 17 separate occasions over the study period.
“COVID-19 will probably behave the same,” she told AFP.
Shaman also studied the circulation of other coronaviruses, following 12 healthy individuals and proving they could be reinfected a second time.
He said that evidence from other respiratory viruses suggested widespread reinfections of COVID-19 was by no means impossible.
On Monday researchers in the Netherlands released the case study of a 89-year-woman who died after contracting COVID-19 twice.
She had been treated for cancer, and her immune system was damaged as a result, making her more susceptible to severe infection.
As the world searches for a vaccine, Iwasaki said that any eventually safe and universal inoculation would need to generate higher levels and longer lasting immunity in people than through natural infection.
“Fortunately, some vaccine candidates appear to do exactly that.”
But reinfections likely meant that any hope of naturally occurring herd immunity “would not be possible,” Iwasaki said.
“Based on what we know about COVID-19, it would be too dangerous to try to achieve herd immunity through natural exposure to this virus, as it can be lethal or detrimental in people of all ages.”
There is also the grim prospect of so-called antibody dependent enhancement – when antibodies actually make subsequent infections worse, such as with dengue fever.
While there is currently no proof that occurs with COVID-19, Shaman said he knows of no-one who can rule that out.
While many governments are basing their hopes of a full economic recovery on a vaccine, Van der Hoek said there may never be a single, entirely effective COVID-19 failsafe.
“The problem with coronavirus antibodies is that they wane so quickly and you can get reinfected with the same strain,” she said.
“So it could be that you need repeated (COVID-19) vaccinations all the time.
“This one will never go away. There is no way we can get rid of it. It will stay with us for the rest of humanity.”",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 14, 2020 9:01 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/second-covid-19-trial-paused-within-24-hours-over-safety-concerns/,Second COVID-19 trial paused within 24 hours over safety concerns,"Two late-stage COVID-19 medical trials have been paused in the space of 24 hours over potential safety concerns, the latest setbacks to scientists in the long fight against the pandemic.
US pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly on Tuesday suspended its Phase 3 trial of its lab-produced antibody treatment in hospitalized patients over an unspecified incident.
A day earlier, the American pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson temporarily halted its Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.
J&J’s research head Mathai Mammen told investors Tuesday it was a “temporary pause” that could be unrelated to their drug.
It’s not unusual for final stage clinical trials to hit a problem – indeed, they are designed to scale up the number of participants to thousands or tens of thousands to tease out side effects that may be very rare.
Last month, British firm AstraZeneca became the first in the world to announce a pause of its vaccine trials after one patient in Britain was diagnosed with an inflammatory condition affecting the spine.
The trial was later resumed around the world but remains suspended in the US for reasons that are unclear.
Doctor and scientist Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Institute, tweeted that he was surprised to hear about the safety concern with Lilly’s antibody treatment, because earlier stages didn’t reveal any serious side effects.
“Hopefully a brief pause and we’ll get details quickly. Good to be cautious,” he said.
“Lilly is supportive of the decision by the independent DSMB (data safety monitoring board) to cautiously ensure the safety of the patients participating in this study,” a spokesperson told AFP in a statement Tuesday.
The study began in August across more than 50 sites in the United States, Denmark and Singapore with the aim of recruiting 10,000 people.
Lab-produced antibody treatments have been making headlines recently after US President Donald Trump credited one therapy, developed by biotech firm Regeneron, with curing him of COVID-19.
Both Lilly and Regeneron last week applied to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorizations for their treatments.
Monoclonal antibodies are a relatively new class of drugs that are best known for treating certain types of cancer and autoimmune disease.
Human immune systems produce antibodies, which are infection-fighting proteins, and vaccines teach our bodies to be prepared to make the right ones for particular pathogens.
The COVID-19 treatment studied in the paused trial was based on an effective antibody Lilly found in a recovered patient.
The host immune cells that produce the antibodies can be cultured in a lab to produce the desired proteins en masse.
Lilly didn’t disclose any details about the safety concern or how many people are affected.
But generally speaking, mild side effects of intravenously administered therapies can include fevers, chills, and fatigue, while moderate to severe infusions can cause chest pain and shortness of breath.
J&J, meanwhile, moved to buoy confidence in its vaccine.
“It’s not at all unusual for unexpected illnesses (to occur) in large studies over their duration,” Mammen said in a conference call.
“In some cases, serious adverse events…may have something or nothing to do with the drug or vaccine being investigated,” he said.
The final stage of J&J’s trial had started recruiting participants in late September, with a goal of enrolling volunteers across more than 200 US and international locations.
J&J is one of 11 organizations globally to begin a Phase 3 trial on a COVID-19 vaccine.
Washington has given the multinational about $1.45 billion in funding under Operation Warp Speed.
The vaccine is based on a single dose of a cold-causing adenovirus, modified so that it can no longer replicate, combined with a part of the new coronavirus called the spike protein that it uses to invade human cells.
J&J used the same technology in its Ebola vaccine, which received marketing approval from the European Commission in July.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/roche-high-volume-rapid-covid-19-test/,Roche rolling out high-volume rapid COVID-19 test by year-end,"Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche said on Tuesday, October 13, it would produce a new antigen test for COVID-19, allowing high-volume and rapid testing for the deadly disease, by the end of the year.
The new Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test is meant to be administered by healthcare professionals in a lab setting and allows the detection of the virus that causes COVID-19 in as little as 18 minutes, Roche said.
It said the “highly accurate” tests could be run through all so-called Cobas analysing equipment that is available in most labs, and that a single such machine could analyze up to 300 tests per hour.
“Being able to quickly and correctly identify if someone has a SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to informing patient management decisions and containing the spread of Covid-19,” Thomas Schinecker, who heads Roche’s diagnostics unit, said in a statement.
The new coronavirus has killed nearly 1.1 million people and infected more than 37.5 million worldwide since it first surfaced in China late last year.
Roche said its test would first be available for countries that recognize the CE mark for products sold in the European Union, adding that it was also seeking approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Antigen tests are typically less sensitive than the more traditional PCR diagnostic test to low levels of virus.

“We have temporarily paused further dosing in all our COVID-19 vaccine candidate clinical trials, including the  Phase 3 ENSEMBLE trial, due to an unexplained illness in a study participant,” the company said in a statement.
The pause means the online enrolment system has been closed for the 60,000-patient clinical trial while the independent patient safety committee is convened.
J&J said that serious adverse events (SAEs) are “an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies.” Company guidelines allowed them to pause a study to determine if the SAE was related to the drug in question and whether to resume study.
The J&J Phase 3 trial had started recruiting participants in late September, with a goal of enrolling up to 60,000 volunteers across more than 200 sites in the US and around the world.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/letting-virus-run-free-herd-immunity-unethical/,Letting virus ‘run free’ with eye to herd immunity ‘unethical’ – WHO,"The World Health Organization chief warned Monday, October 12, against just allowing the new coronavirus to spread in the hope of achieving so-called herd immunity, saying it was “unethical.”
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned against calls in some countries to let COVID-19 run its course until enough people develop the immunity needed to naturally halt its spread.
“Herd immunity is a concept used for vaccination, in which a population can be protected from a certain virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached,” he pointed out during a virtual press briefing.
For measles, for instance, it is estimated that if 95% of the population is vaccinated, the remaining 5% will also be protected from the spread of the virus.
For polio, the threshold is estimated at 80%.
“Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing them to it,” Tedros said.
“Never in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an outbreak, let alone a pandemic,” he insisted.
The new coronavirus has killed well over one million people and infected more than 37.5 million since it first surfaced in China late last year.
Relying on naturally obtaining herd immunity in such a situation would be “scientifically and ethically problematic,” Tedros said.
“Allowing a dangerous virus that we don’t fully understand to run free is simply unethical. It’s not an option.”
He pointed to the lack of information on the development of immunity to COVID-19, including how strong the immune response is and how long antibodies remain in the body.
Tedros pointed to some cases where people are believed to have been infected with the virus a second time.
He also stressed the many long-term health problems of infection, which researchers are only just beginning to understand.
And he pointed out that it has been estimated that less than 10% of the population in most countries are believed to have contracted the disease.
“The vast majority of people in most countries remain susceptible to this virus,” he said.
“Letting the virus circulate unchecked therefore means allowing unnecessary infections, suffering, and death.”
Overall, it is estimated that 0.6% of people who contract COVID-19 die from the disease, Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead on the virus, told Monday’s briefing.
“That may not sound like a lot,” she acknowledged, stressing though that it “is a lot higher than (for) influenza.”
She also pointed out that “the infection fatality ratio increases dramatically with age.”
While the elderly and people with underlying health conditions are clearly most likely to fall seriously ill from COVID-19, Tedros stressed that they are not the only ones at risk.
“People of all ages have died,” he said.
The UN agency also voiced optimism at the speed at which vaccines against the virus are being developed, with 40 vaccine candidates in clinical trials, including 10 in late-stage Phase III trials.
US President Trump has repeatedly promised that a COVID-19 vaccine will be ready before next month’s US elections.
But WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said the vaccines in late-stage trials were not expected to produce sufficient data to request regulatory approval until December, at “the earliest.”
“Into the early part of 2021, we expect a number of trials to start providing data for regulators to look at,” she said.
After that though, regulators would need to go through the data before making their decisions.
“This is going to be a lot of data and also for the WHO,” she said.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 13, 2020 8:59 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-reinfection-casts-doubt-virus-immunity/,COVID-19 reinfection casts doubt on virus immunity – study,"COVID-19 patients may experience more severe symptoms the second time they are infected, according to research released Tuesday, October 13, confirming it is possible to catch the potentially deadly disease more than once.
A study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal charts the first confirmed case of COVID-19 reinfection in the United States – the country worst hit by the pandemic – and indicates that exposure to the virus may not guarantee future immunity.
The patient, a 25-year-old Nevada man, was infected with two distinct variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, within a 48-day time frame.
The second infection was more severe than the first, resulting in the patient being hospitalized with oxygen support.
The paper noted 4 other cases of reinfection confirmed globally, with one patient each in Belgium, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Ecuador.
Experts said the prospect of reinfection could have a profound impact on how the world battles through the pandemic.
In particular, it could influence the hunt for a vaccine – the currently Holy Grail of pharmaceutical research.
“The possibility of reinfections could have significant implications for our understanding of COVID-19 immunity, especially in the absence of an effective vaccine,” said Mark Pandori, for the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory and lead study author.
“We need more research to understand how long immunity may last for people exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and why some of these second infections, while rare, are presenting as more severe.”
Vaccines work by triggering the body’s natural immune response to a certain pathogen, arming it with antibodies it to fight off future waves of infection.
But it is not at all clear how long COVID-19 antibodies last.
For some diseases, such as measles, infection confers lifelong immunity. For other pathogens, immunity may be fleeting at best.
The authors said the US patient could have been exposed to a very high dose of the virus the second time around, triggering a more acute reaction.
Alternatively, it may have been a more virulent strain of the virus.
Another hypothesis is a mechanism known as antibody dependent enhancement – that is, when antibodies actually make subsequent infections worse, such as with dengue fever.
The researchers pointed out that reinfection of any kind remains rare, with only a handful of confirmed cases out of tens of millions of COVID-19 infections globally.
However, since many cases are asymptomatic and therefore unlikely to have tested positive initially, it may be impossible to know if a given COVID-19 case is the first or second infection.
In a linked comment to The Lancet paper, Akiko Iwasaka, a professor of Immunobiology and Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at Yale University, said the findings could impact public health measures.
“As more cases of reinfection surface, the scientific community will have the opportunity to understand better the correlates of protection and how frequently natural infections with SARS-CoV-2 induce that level of immunity,” she said.

The US government’s investment will see up to 100,000 doses delivered “towards the end of 2020,” with the option for another one million doses next year, AstraZeneca said.
The company is enrolling 6,100 participants in two separate testing regimes of the “long-acting antibody (LAAB)” combination treatment in the United States and other countries, starting “in the next weeks.”
One will evaluate its safety and efficacy “to prevent infection for up to 12 months” and involves around 5,000 participants, the company said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange.
The second will evaluate post-exposure prophylaxis and pre-emptive treatment in approximately 1,100 participants, it added.
AstraZeneca said it is also planning additional trials to evaluate the drug in approximately 4,000 patients for the treatment of COVID-19.
“This agreement with the US government will help accelerate the development of our long-acting antibody combination which has the potential to provide immediate and long-lasting effect in both preventing and treating COVID-19 infections,” chief executive Pascal Soriot said.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 12, 2020 6:12 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/coronavirus-can-survive-28-days-surfaces/,Coronavirus ‘can survive for 28 days on surfaces’ – study,"The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can survive on items such as banknotes and phones for up to 28 days in cool, dark conditions, according to a study by Australia’s national science agency.
Researchers at CSIRO’s disease preparedness center tested the longevity of SARS-CoV-2 in the dark at 3 temperatures, showing survival rates decreased as conditions became hotter, the agency said Monday, October 12.
The scientists found that at 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit), SARS-CoV-2 was “extremely robust” on smooth surfaces – like mobile phone screens – surviving for 28 days on glass, steel, and plastic banknotes.
At 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), the survival rate dropped to 7 days and plunged to just 24 hours at 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).
The virus survived for shorter periods on porous surfaces such as cotton – up to 14 days at the lowest temperatures and less than 16 hours at the highest – the researchers said.
This was “significantly longer” than previous studies which found the disease could survive for up to 4 days on non-porous surfaces, according to the paper published in the peer-reviewed Virology Journal.
Trevor Drew, director of the Australian Center for Disease Preparedness, said the study involved drying samples of the virus on different materials before testing them, using an “extremely sensitive” method that found traces of live virus able to infect cell cultures.
“This doesn’t mean to say that that amount of virus would be capable of infecting someone,” he told public broadcaster ABC.
He added that if a person was “careless with these materials and touched them and then licked your hands or touched your eyes or your nose, you might well get infected upwards of two weeks after they had been contaminated.”
Drew said there were several caveats including that the study was conducted with fixed levels of virus that likely represented the peak of a typical infection, and there was an absence of exposure to ultraviolet light, which can rapidly degrade the virus.
Humidity was kept steady at 50%, the study said, as increases in humidity have also been found as detrimental to the virus.
According to the CSIRO, the virus appears to primarily spread through the air but more research was needed to provide further insights into the transmission of the virus via surfaces.
“While the precise role of surface transmission, the degree of surface contact, and the amount of virus required for infection is yet to be determined, establishing how long this virus remains viable on surfaces is critical for developing risk mitigation strategies in high contact areas,” CSIRO’s Debbie Eagles said.
The main message remains that “infectious people are far, far more infectious than surfaces,” Drew told the ABC.
“But nevertheless, it may help to explain why even when we got rid of the infectious people, we do occasionally get these breakouts again, sometimes even in a country which is considered to be free,” he said.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 12, 2020 10:14 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/no-physical-injuries-minimizes-emotional-trauma-assault-survivors/,Reporting ‘no physical injuries’ belittles emotional trauma of assault survivors,"‘No physical injuries’ minimizes the emotional trauma of assault survivors
In August 2020, a woman walking along a neighbourhood street in my hometown of London, Ont., was the target of gender-based violence by a man believed to have committed similar violence against another woman 6 days earlier.
Such incidents are far too common and likely under-reported, but when they do garner media coverage, the stories consistently include a line that I highlight here, verbatim from the news report:
This statement, or one to that effect, appears to be a standard concluding line of reports about assault. While perhaps intended to comfort readers, I suggest it is dismissive of the full impact of the wounds suffered and call on reporters to immediately cease such language.
I am a pain, stress and trauma researcher at Western University. I have spent the past 15 years exploring the long-term impacts of trauma. My focus has largely been on physical trauma — things like car crashes, workplace, home or sports injuries and their physical, emotional and social consequences.
One of the many things I have learned from this work is that those who develop chronic health problems following trauma — whether the problems are persistent pain, depression, disability or post-traumatic stress disorder — can rarely be predicted by the severity of the physical injuries.
While I don’t doubt that police statements regarding survivors’ lack of physical injuries are largely accurate, the inference that the violence was therefore less serious is problematic. In any such experience, there are physical wounds and emotional wounds.
Assault or gender-based violence is a trauma. The wounds experienced go beyond the visible skin, bone and tissues. They impact directly on the psyche, and they are very real.
It is past time that we acknowledge that the psychological wounds from trauma and violence — whether it’s sexual, emotional, physical, financial, social or otherwise — can manifest themselves in myriad ways on a person’s future. These are challenging to connect and are often hidden to both the survivors themselves and others in their lives.
However, acknowledgement of these connections seems paramount to improving access to compassionate post-trauma care. Dismissing gender-based violence or trauma as less serious because of a lack of visible physical injuries interferes with the survivor’s ability to access adequate supports for current and future mental or physical health challenges. Research also shows that the often invisible nature of post-trauma consequences can result in experiences of stigma, self-doubt and shame.
I have heard from survivors who were not encouraged to, or felt they should not, seek medical care when the police dismissed their assault as less problematic owing to the lack of obvious physical injury.
Similarly, many people with chronic post-trauma pain are often afraid to report it because of their lack of visible physical injuries.
I assume the “not physically injured” line is intended to ease the distress of the readers who may feel relieved to read that the victim wasn’t physically injured.
The result, I believe, is that the survivor’s experience of trauma is harmfully minimized. I also believe such language has contributed to the broad-based stigma around mental health and removes the ability of survivors to feel, express and seek support during times of distress and vulnerability.
While I have no interest in over-pathologizing the experience, it strikes me that we never hear news stories of these same people 10 years later. We never hear or read a followup, detailing nightmares and sleepless nights, the chronic pain, sexual dysfunction, depressed mood or financial stresses since encountered by survivors.
I suspect these stories would make reports of gender-based violence far more difficult to hear. But they need to be heard.
I call for an ethic of empathy in reports from the media and police. At a time when empathy for one’s neighbor, community, and world seem in short supply, changing a few words in these all-too-common news releases and media reports feels like a good first step.
I would personally be more comforted if such reports closed with:
This of course demands that appropriate emotional supports be available for trauma survivors, in which much of Canada appears to fall short. Recognition of the long-term consequences and supports needed could be an effective means to pressure governments and other decision-makers to ensure adequate funding of social, emotional and mental health services.
By ignoring these, we too often leave survivors to manage the long-term suffering on their own. – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/being-outdoors-does-not-mean-safe-covid-19-white-house-event/,Being outdoors doesn’t mean you’re safe from COVID-19 – a White House event showed what not to do,"The following was originally published on The Conversation.
If you think you’re safe from the coronavirus just because you’re outdoors, think again.
While the wind and the large volume of air make the outdoors less risky than being indoors, circumstances matter.
Someone who is infectious can cough or sneeze, or just talk and, if you happen to inhale those respiratory droplets or they plop into your eye, you can get infected. If you shake hands with an infected person and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth, you also run a chance of getting infected. You don’t have to be inhaling an infected person’s air for very long. What matters is the dose.
As an infectious disease doctor, I get a lot of questions from patients about COVID-19 risks. Here are some answers about the risks outdoors.
It’s true that the wind helps disperse respiratory droplets that can carry viruses.
When you’re indoors, one of the big concerns about how the coronavirus spreads is aerosols – tiny, light droplets people emit along with larger droplets when they breathe. These particles can linger in the air, and the concentration can build up in enclosed, poorly ventilated spaces. There’s less of a risk in open outdoor settings because of the sheer volume of air and available space to physically distance.
At least one study, not yet peer reviewed, found COVID-19 patients were nearly 20 times more likely to have been infected indoors than outdoors.
But that doesn’t mean you’re in a protective bubble when outdoors.
To get a sense of how easy it is to put yourself at risk outdoors, look at crowd photos from the White House Rose Garden event on Sept. 26. About 200 people attended that ceremony, and at least 12 tested positive for the virus within days, including President Donald Trump and two senators. When and where each person was infected isn’t known, but several behaviors at the Rose Garden ceremony raised the risk of getting or sharing the virus.
The first problem with this scene: Very few people were wearing face masks.
With no mask, infectious people can be shedding the virus when they talk and there is nothing to stop the respiratory droplets. For people not yet infected, no mask means the virus has several ways to enter their bodies – nose and mouth as well as eyes. The lack of masks also raises the risk of getting a larger dose, and a higher viral load may mean a higher likelihood of severe disease.
People were also seated close together. And before and after the ceremony, they mingled – indoors and outdoors – shaking hands, leaning in for close conversations, and hugging each other.
Remember that just breathing expels respiratory droplets, and loud, animated speech like laughing or shouting expels more. We don’t yet know how much virus is needed to trigger symptoms, but those doses add up. So, you might get a small dose from a person sitting next to you, but if that person later gives you a big hug or shakes your hand, they could give you another dose. Or you might talk to someone else who is infectious for several minutes and inhale more virus particles.
All it takes is one person in the peak infectious period – the 24 to 48 hours before and after symptoms start – to spark a superspreader event.
Face masks lower your risk of getting infected, and they also reduce the amount of virus you’re spreading if you’re infected.
If you’re running or walking, carry a mask with you. When you’re near other people, put it on.
If you’re sitting at an outdoor café, try to mask up between bites and sips, especially if your age or health or weight make you vulnerable to severe COVID-19.
The likelihood of a passing interaction from someone walking by a table is small, but it’s still possible. The safest spot when eating outdoors is a table away from high-traffic areas and upwind of everyone else.
Depending on where you are, maximize the distance between yourself and others. There’s nothing magic about staying 6 feet apart. Particles generated by sneezes can travel a lot farther than that.
Twelve or 15 feet is safer.
It’s all about minimizing risk. You can never drive that risk to zero when you’re in public.
Think of the coronavirus like a sexually transmitted disease – everyone claims to behave safely, but do you really know where they’ve been? It just takes one infected person. Rapid COVID-19 tests aren’t 100% accurate, either, and are presently unavailable for most people.
To keep things safe for an outdoor gathering, set up tables for each social bubble – a family, for example. Keep the tables at least 15 to 20 feet apart. Set up food on individual plates in a central location and have people or each bubble go up separately. Don’t share utensils or food or glasses. Wear masks as much as possible, and don’t forget physical distancing.
There is a lot we still don’t know about the coronavirus, including what the long-term damage is. Regardless of how old you are or how healthy, do what you can to avoid the virus until there’s a vaccine. Even if you get over the illness quickly, we don’t know what the long-term consequences will be. – TheConversation/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/how-opening-window-could-help-you-avoid-covid-19/,How opening a window could help you avoid COVID-19,"While billions are being spent on the search for a COVID-19 vaccine and treatment, experts say there may be something you can do to help avoid the virus that costs nothing: open the window.
Growing evidence suggests that allowing air to circulate around enclosed spaces can help disperse the air-borne viral droplets that cause infection.
These fine clouds of particles, known as aerosols, are thought to be able to remain suspended in the air for long periods, even hours.
That’s where reaching for the window latch may help.
Epidemiologist Antoine Flahault likened dispersing the viral cloud to airing out a room when someone is smoking.
“What do you do? You open a window to let the smoke out,” he told AFP. “And it’s the same for these invisible coronavirus aerosols.”
The American Centers for Disease Control updated its advice this week to include guidance on enclosed areas.
“Avoid crowded indoor spaces and ensure indoor spaces are properly ventilated by bringing in outdoor air as much as possible,” it now says on its website.
The CDC has added aerosols to its official list of coronavirus transmission routes, although the main way the virus spreads is still through respiratory droplets emitted by infectious individuals.
Experts in other countries have argued for months for more rigorous measures to dispel the threat of aerosol transmission, which were largely absent from public health guidance at the start of the pandemic.
Germany is one country where official guidance encourages people to leave the windows open.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said last month that ventilation “could be one of the least expensive and most effective measures to stop the propagation of the pandemic.”
Bernhard Junge-Hulsing, a German doctor, advised people to keep the windows open, at home or at work, even as winter approaches.
“You can always wear a pullover,” he said.
But how much ventilation is enough to disperse the aerosol?
“We recommend a total recirculation of the air in a room at least 6 times an hour. That takes quite a lot,” said Flahault, director of the University of Geneva’s Global Health Institute.
In certain settings this can be achieved by circulation systems, which are often fitted with high-tech filters that also cleanse the air.
“Six times an hour is what you find on board a TGV (high-speed train) or aeroplane, where the air quality is very good,” said Flahault.
“But in most closed spaces we don’t have that level of ventilation.”
Although opening windows could help avoid spreading the coronavirus, experts stress that no single measure can guarantee protection.
“Limit the number of people in the room, don’t stay in it too long, maintain social distancing, wear a mask at all times, wash your hands regularly, and try not to talk or shout too much,” said Flahault.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 9, 2020 9:56 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/trump-touted-covid-19-antibody-treatments/,Trump-touted COVID-19 antibody treatments: What we know,"Two US companies have applied for emergency approval for their lab-produced antibodies against COVID-19 – and President Donald Trump has signaled his strong backing based on the fact he was treated with one of them.
Here’s what we know about the treatments and why the perception of political interference at the Food and Drug Administration may have eroded public trust.
The therapies developed by Regeneron and Eli Lilly are called “monoclonal antibodies,” a relatively new class of drugs that are best known for treating certain types of cancer and autoimmune disease.
Our own immune systems produce antibodies, which are infection-fighting molecules, and vaccines teach our bodies to be prepared to make the right ones for particular pathogens.
Another potential strategy is to give a patient fighting a disease the antibodies of someone who has already recovered. This is known as convalescent plasma, but it’s hard to procure plasma on a big enough scale to use it very widely.
Regeneron and Lilly have developed “cocktails” of antibodies based on the most effective ones they have discovered. In the case of Regeneron, one of these came from a person and the other from a mouse with a genetically-modified human-like immune system.
They all work by binding to and distorting a surface structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus called the “spike protein” that it uses to invade human cells.
The host immune cells that produce the antibodies can be cultured in a lab to produce the desired antibodies en masse.
Antibodies can’t be ingested in a pill and instead have to be transfused using a drip. In theory they could be used to immunize people too, but unlike vaccines the protection would be highly transient.
Both companies have released some early data based on a few hundred non-hospitalized patients in clinical trials, with both claiming their treatments reduced viral load and recovery time.
One particularly eye-catching figure came from Lilly’s mid-stage trial, which showed the rate of COVID-related hospitalization and emergency visits was 0.9% for patients treated with its therapy versus 5.8% on placebo.
That result however was for Lilly’s “combination” treatment of two antibodies, whereas it has so far only applied for emergency approval for a “monotherapy” of one antibody, because it has greater stocks of it and more safety data available.
Both companies said their trials haven’t produced any serious safety concerns so far.
Trump, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 last week and was treated with Regeneron’s version, has made it clear he is a big fan. “It really did a fantastic job, I want to get for you what I got,” he said in a video.
They weren’t used to create the antibodies, but cells derived from a human embryonic kidney in the 1970s were used to produce virus “pseudoparticles” with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in order to test out the treatment.
Last year the Trump administration ended federal funding for most new scientific research on fetal tissue from elective abortions.
A Regeneron spokeswoman told AFP that the original documents about the cells made no mention of how they were obtained.
The president’s comments, based on his personal experience rather than data, heighten fears for the integrity of the regulatory process.
In theory, the FDA operates independently from the White House, but its decision to issue an emergency use approval (EUA) in March for the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine touted by Trump raised serious concerns.
No clinical trials have yet found in favor of using hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19, and the EUA was later withdrawn over safety fears.
The evidence standard used to grant emergency approval for the antiviral remdesivir was much greater – a final stage trial involving more than a 1,000 patients.
More than 6,000 patients were studied in a British trial that showed the steroid dexamethasone lowered mortality rates in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which in turn led to US authorities recommending it.
But the FDA has also given an EUA for convalescent plasma, despite there being no trial data in its favor yet – so approval of monoclonal antibodies does seem likely.
FDA chief Stephen Hahn restored some independent experts’ faith when his agency on Wednesday released its guidelines for approving a COVID-19 vaccine.
The document said that makers need at least two months of follow-up data from patients after receiving their final dose, which makes it unlikely there will be an injection on the market before the November 3 election – something Trump has repeatedly sought.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 9, 2020 9:26 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/why-you-should-never-use-microsoft-excel-count-coronavirus-cases/,Why you should never use Microsoft Excel to count coronavirus cases,"The following was originally published in The Conversation.
Public Health England has admitted that 16,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK were missed from daily figures being reported between September 25 and October 2. The missing figures were subsequently added to the daily totals, but given the importance of these numbers for monitoring the outbreak and making key decisions, the results of the error are far-reaching.
Not only does it lead to underestimating the scale of coronavirus in the UK, but perhaps more important is the subsequent delay in entering the details of positive cases into the NHS Test and Trace system which is used by a team of contact tracers. Although all those who tested positive had been informed of their results, other people in close contact with them and potentially at risk of exposure were not immediately followed up (ideally within 48 hours). This was a serious error. What could have caused it?
It emerged later that that day a “technical glitch” was to blame. To be more specific, the lab test results were being transferred to Excel templates. The templates hit a limit in the number of rows they could handle and then failed to update with more cases added. The issue was resolved with all new cases added to the totals reported over the weekend by breaking the data down across smaller spreadsheets.
The issue may have been fixed, but people’s confidence in the testing system in place in England will undoubtedly take a knock. It’s also likely that politicians and media will use this as political ammunition to argue the incompetence of government and Public Health England. Is this the right response? What should we take away from this mistake?
We should not forget that the government and public health workers are doing an incredibly challenging and demanding job dealing with a pandemic. But this kind of mistake was avoidable. We live in a world of big data, with artificial intelligence and machine learning permeating all aspects of our lives. We have smart factories and smart cities; we have self-driving cars and machines trained to exhibit human intelligence. And yet Public Health England used Microsoft Excel as an intermediary to manage a large volume of sensitive data. And herein lies the problem.
Although Excel is popular and commonly used for analysis, it has several limitations that make it unsuitable for large amounts of data and more sophisticated analyses.
The companies that analyzed the swab tests to identify who had the virus submitted their results as comma-separated text files to PHE. These were then ingested into Excel templates to be uploaded to a central system to be made available to the Test and Trace team and government. Although today’s Excel spreadsheets can handle 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns, developers at PHE used an older Excel file format (XLS instead of XLSX) resulting in each template being able to store only around 65,000 rows of data (or around 1,400 cases). When the limit was reached, any further cases were left off the template and therefore positive cases of coronavirus were missed in the daily reporting.
The bigger issue is that, in light of the data-driven and technologically advanced age in which we live, that a system based on shipping around Excel templates was even deemed suitable in the first place. Data engineers have for a long time been supporting businesses with managing, transforming and serving up data, and developing methods for building efficient, robust and accurate data pipelines. Data professionals have also developed approaches to information governance, including assessing data quality and developing appropriate security protocols.
For this kind of custom application there are plenty of data management technologies that could have been used, ranging from on-site to cloud-based solutions that can scale and provide managed data storage for subsequent reporting and analysis. The Public Health England developers no doubt had some reason to transform the text files into Excel templates, presumably to fit with legacy IT systems. But avoiding Excel together and shipping the data from source (with appropriate cleaning and checks) into the system would have been better and reduced the number of steps in the pipeline.
Despite the benefits and widespread use of using Excel, it is not always the right tool for the job, especially for a data-driven system with such an important function. You can’t accurately report, model, or make decisions on inaccurate or poor quality data.
During this pandemic we are all on a journey of discovery. Rather than point the finger and play the blame game, we need to reflect and learn from our mistakes. From this incident, we need to work on getting the basics right – and that includes robust data management. Perhaps rather concerning are reports that Public Health England is now breaking the lab data into smaller batches to create a larger number of Excel templates. This seems a poor fix and doesn’t really get to the root of the problem – the need for a robust data management infrastructure.
It is also remarkable how quickly technology or the algorithm is blamed (especially by politicians), but herein lies another fundamental issue – accountability and taking responsibility. In the face of a pandemic we need to work together, take responsibility, and handle data appropriately. – TheConversation/Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/covid-19-intubation-may-be-less-risky-than-feared/,"COVID-19 intubation may be less risky than feared, says study","Procedures like inserting or removing breathing tubes, which were thought to pose a serious danger of COVID-19 transmission to health workers, produce less aerosols than a normal cough, according to new research published Tuesday, October 6.
A particular concern for doctors and nurses during the pandemic has been that intubation – when a tube is placed in the patient’s airway to help them breathe – could create a fine mist of viral particles and create an infection danger for hospital staff.
This has caused health authorities in Britain to classify them as ‘aerosol generating procedures,’ meaning health workers need respirators and high level personal protective equipment and the operating rooms are cleaned using a special technique to remove aerosols. Researchers say using this technique has “dramatically” slowed surgery and contributed to long hospital waiting lists.
But a new study published in Anaesthesia, the journal of the Association of Anesthetists, found that both intubation and the removal of the breathing tube after surgery produce much less aerosol than had previously been assumed.
While the research was not performed on patients with COVID-19 for safety reasons, the authors from the University of Bristol and hospitals in Bristol and Bath called for the risk levels of the procedures to be reassessed.
“The results suggest that during anesthesia tube insertion should not be considered a high-risk procedure,” the authors said.
“We detected no increases in aerosolised particles during face-mask ventilation, airway suction or repeated attempts at intubation,” they wrote.
“This reflects typical clinical practice by anaesthetists with a range of experience, providing further reassurance regarding the low level of aerosol generation.”
The researchers worked to quantify the aerosols generated during various anesthesia procedures for insertion and removal of tubes from patients’ airways, as well as other breathing assistance, in real clinical settings.
They looked at 19 tube insertions and 14 tube removals and found – against expectations – that tube insertion generated approximately one thousandth of the aerosol generated by a single cough.
Tube removal produced more aerosol, especially when accompanied by a weak cough, which sometimes occurs when patients resume breathing on their own.
But researchers said this was still less than 25% of that produced by a voluntary cough.
The authors note that their study was limited because they were unable to directly study the risk of transmission of the new coronavirus, adding their “interpretation rests on the widely accepted link between aerosol generation and infection risk”.
They said the research could have implications for the distribution of protective equipment in hospitals, which is allocated on the basis of how risky a given situation is considered.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 7, 2020 1:05 PM PHT"

The “rolling review” is the second being conducted by the Amsterdam-based European Medicines Agency (EMA), after it already agreed to evaluate a possible COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca and Britain’s Oxford University.
Scientists around the world are racing to develop a safe and efficient COVID-19 jab to end a pandemic that has killed more than a million people and devastated the global economy.
A “rolling review” is used to speed up assessments of promising drugs or vaccines during a public health emergency. It allows the EMA to review data as it comes in, even while trials are still ongoing.
In normal times, pharma companies would complete their tests and compile all their findings first before submitting them for review.
“It is our duty to ensure that while we are working to develop a potential vaccine at unprecedented speed to help address this pandemic, we do so with the highest ethical standards while adhering to sound scientific principles,” BioNTech CEO and co-founder Ugur Sahin said in a statement, adding: “We will continue to have regular and open dialogue with the EMA throughout the rolling review process.”
The potential BioNTech-Pfizer coronavirus vaccine uses new technology based on mRNA, a type of genetic material never before used to make a vaccine.
It is one of 9 vaccine candidates to have advanced to late-stage human trials, known as phase 3 clinical trials, when they are tested on thousands of volunteers.
More than 37,000 people are currently enrolled in the BioNTech-Pfizer study, including in the United States, Brazil, South Africa, and Argentina. More than 28,000 of them have recently received their second shot, the statement said.
The EMA stressed in a separate statement that the decision to start an accelerated review “does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness, as much of the evidence is still to be submitted.”
BioNTech has previously said it aims to supply up to a 100 million doses by the end of 2020 if its vaccine is successful, and 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 6, 2020 8:24 PM PHT"

While not unique to Indonesia, padlocks, shackles and chains are frequently used to cover for a lack of proper mental health provision in the world’s fourth most-populous nation.
But the coronavirus epidemic has exacerbated the problem, forcing many people back into chains after they had been freed following a change in attitudes, and access to medication and better care.
Rauf, 40, spent decades in shackles until a few years ago, when he was finally allowed to wander on his own – usually to his favorite place, a crowded market.
The virus has forced the return of old methods, however, and he is once again shackled and locked in a cramped backyard hut where he eats, sleeps and defecates.
“We don’t want him to be infected by the virus as we learned that things are now getting worse,” said Hasni, Rauf’s aunt who looks after him in Polewali in West Sulawesi.
She also worries that virus lockdowns could restrict Rauf’s access to medication, and fears he could harm himself or others.
Locking up people with mental health conditions used to be common in Indonesia – particularly among families who could not cope or afford appropriate care.
Foreign tourists in Bali would often be shocked to discover someone chained to a tree in an otherwise picture-perfect village.
A national campaign helped thousands to gain better access to mental health treatment and medication, and experts believed they had turned the corner – until the virus struck.
“This is the tragedy with the pandemic that it is happening in so many countries including across Indonesia,” said Kriti Sharma, a senior disability rights researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW).
In a report released Tuesday entitled “Living in Chains: Shackling of People with Psychosocial Disabilities Worldwide,” HRW documented hundreds of thousands of people with mental health issues – some as young as 10 – being confined for years.
Psychosocial disability – when a mental illness interferes with a person’s ability to function – can arise from any mental health issue if the impact on their life is severe enough.
The report was released ahead of World Mental Health day on Saturday.
Cases of shackling were either gathered by field workers, reported by locals, or shared by relatives unable to cope.
“It is a practice that is widespread, brutal and an open secret in many communities,” Sharma said.
Indonesia’s health ministry – which has registered nearly 300,000 people as experiencing mental health conditions – said it had recorded more than 6,000 “shackling” cases in the first half of the year, a rise of more than 1,000 on the whole of 2019.
“The number could double if the pandemic continues,” said Siti Khalimah, the director for mental health affairs at the ministry.
Describing the latest figures as the “tip of the iceberg”, she said many more cases were likely to go undiscovered because of shame or social stigma.
Mental health services had been severely hampered by coronavirus lockdowns, she added, with patients unable to visit clinics, or medical workers travel to communities.
Sodikin, 34, was released in 2016 after spending more than 8 years in chains in Cianjur, West Java.
A combination of medication and proper advice meant his progress was astounding, and in 2018 he started work at a clothing factory – becoming a breadwinner for the family.
But he is now locked up again after coronavirus restrictions cost him access to medication and community-based mental health services.
“He was fine for years, but since the pandemic he became uncontrollable,” Sodikin’s older brother Mustafa told AFP.
“We have no choice but to lock him up. If he is taking drugs he is fine, but if he is running out he becomes uncontrollable.
“We don’t have money to afford proper medication.”
In West Sulawesi, another patient – father-of-four Ahmad, 38 – was asleep in a shed with his feet and hands chained when an AFP reporter visited.
“We don’t have any money for treatment,” said his brother, Nurdian. “Even before the pandemic we were struggling… now the situation is even more difficult.
“This way we can carry on working our fields without having to worry about him,” he added.
“We are sad seeing him chained like this, but it is the only option we have.”",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 6, 2020 1:12 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/faces-more-important-humans-dogs/,Faces more important for humans than dogs – study,"Faces are more important for humans than dogs, according to a brain activity study on how the two species see each other published by a team of Hungarian and Mexican researchers Monday, October 5.
“The brain imaging findings in the study suggest that faces may be of crucial importance to humans and probably other primates, but not to all mammals, for example not for dogs,” Attila Andics, who led the study at Eotvos Lorand university in Budapest, told AFP.
“The two species differ in their visual communication and this is reflected in their brains,” he said.
A team of Hungary- and Mexico-based researchers compared how dog and human brains process visual information.
They used scanners to monitor 30 humans and 20 dogs while they looked at short video clips of dog and human faces, and the backs of heads.
The brain response results showed that a large part of the human brain’s neural network responds more to faces than non-faces in the videos. Only a small part responded more to human than dog images.
In dogs’ brains however, no parts responded more to faces but some parts responded more to dog images than human images, said the study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience.
“Faces are very central for human visual communication, we possess a dedicated large neural network for face processing when we meet someone,” Andics told AFP.
Previous research has shown that dogs also pay attention to faces, excel at eye contact and at reading facial emotion, but also rely on signals such as the other dog’s tail or body posture to communicate.
“When we meet someone we look at faces mostly,” said Andics.
“Other signals are also important for humans but the proportions are different than with dogs, when two dogs meet there is no clear focus on faces,” he said.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 6, 2020 11:10 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/nobel-laureates-say-political-will-needed-end-virus-outbreaks/,Nobel laureates say ‘political will’ needed to end virus outbreaks,"Technological advancements and international cooperation have accelerated scientific understanding of COVID-19 but it will take political will to end virus outbreaks, the new Nobel laureates in medicine said Monday, October 5.
Americans Charles Rice of The Rockefeller University and Harvey Alter of the National Institutes of Health were honored along with Briton Michael Houghton for the discovery of the Hepatitis C virus.
In separate press conferences, the laureates noted how long it had taken them to achieve their results.
“It is a long story, kind of a 50 years saga,” said 85-year-old Alter who began his research in the 1960s.
But they added how technological improvements now meant quicker results.
“There is a big difference between the 1970s and ’80s and now. The technology is so advanced it’s astounding,” he added.
Rice, 68, said it took them “months and months of toil to sequence a single viral genome.”
“Now people can do that in a matter of hours. And the rate at which people have been able to make progress on understanding… COVID-19 is just spectacular,” he added.
For Houghton these technological advancements, especially in the development of vaccines, are the “silver behind the lining of the COVID cloud.”
Rice said global scientific cooperation in response to the coronavirus pandemic was “reassuring” for battles against future viruses.
He added it had changed “the way that science is done to really make it more of a community effort rather than something that years ago might have been pursued by a few labs in isolation.”
Alter said though that the rush to find cures should not come at the expense of proper research.
“You need to have long-range planning, long-range thinking, and the freedom to pursue things that don’t have an immediate effect. And nowadays if you don’t have an endpoint it’s hard to get funding,” he added.
Alter said the science of Hepatitis C, which kills about 400,000 people every year, is now such that better testing and drugs are not required.
“What we need is the political will to eradicate it,” he added.
Alter said the same needed to be done for COVID-19.
“The kind of things that needs to be done mainly is to test and treat. If we had a great rapid test for COVID and a great treatment for COVID, it would be the same, the same principle,” he said.
Houghton added that it was also necessary to respect basic health rules.
“It is disconcerting when you see not everyone doing what you know as a virologist makes sense, which is to socially distancing and wear a mask and so forth,” he said.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 6, 2020 9:01 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/world/global-affairs/mental-health-toll-coronavirus-pandemic-devastating-who/,Mental health toll of pandemic ‘devastating’ – WHO,"The COVID-19 pandemic is having a “devastating impact” on mental health services globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Monday, October 5, ahead of a large fundraising push.
It warned that mental health had been overlooked in the crisis, pointing to a survey conducted between June and August that revealed severe disruptions to services in 93 countries.
While 83% of the 130 countries surveyed had included mental health in their coronavirus pandemic response plans, only 17% had actually set up the full funding required, it said.
“This is a forgotten aspect of COVID-19,” WHO mental health director Devora Kestel told a virtual media briefing, stressing the urgent need for increased funding.
Before the pandemic, countries were spending less than 2% of their national health budget on mental health, and were struggling to meet demand, the WHO said.
That demand has now dramatically increased due to the pandemic.
“Bereavement, isolation, loss of income and fear are triggering mental health conditions or exacerbating existing ones,” the agency said in a statement.
“Many people may be facing increased levels of alcohol and drug use, insomnia, and anxiety.”
Though all regions of the world have been affected, high-income nations had been better able to maintain the provision of services.
WHO’s survey found that 30% of countries reported some disruption in emergency mental health provision and medication supplies for people with disorders.
Prevention services were sharply affected while travel restrictions hindered patient access to health facilities.
However, countries are learning to respond with innovative solutions such as telemedicine and teletherapy interventions.
The WHO also said more data was needed on COVID-19’s effect on brain health, with fewer than one in 10 countries conducting research.
The WHO said that estimates before the coronavirus pandemic showed that nearly $1 trillion in economic productivity was lost annually from depression and anxiety alone.
However, studies showed that every dollar spent on evidence-based care for depression and anxiety returned $5.
On Saturday, the WHO is hosting on social media “The Big Event for Mental Health,” calling for increased investment.
Those taking part include Queen Mathilde of the Belgians; footballer Alisson Becker, the Brazil and Liverpool goalkeeper; and pop star Lady Gaga’s mother Cynthia Germanotta.
Also involved are the widow of Chester Bennington, the Linkin Park singer who committed suicide in 2017, and Klas Bergling, the father of the Swedish superstar DJ Avicii, who was found dead two years ago aged 28.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 5, 2020 9:22 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/winners-nobel-prize-medicine-2020/,US-British trio win Nobel Medicine Prize for Hepatitis C discovery,"Americans Harvey Alter and Charles Rice together with Briton Michael Houghton won the Nobel Medicine Prize on Monday, October 5, for the discovery of the Hepatitis C virus, paving the way for a cure, the Nobel jury said.
The 3 were honored for their “decisive contribution to the fight against blood-borne hepatitis, a major global health problem that causes cirrhosis and liver cancer in people around the world,” the jury said.
The World Health Organization estimates there are around 70 million Hepatitis C infections globally, causing around 400,000 deaths each year. It is characterized by poor appetite, vomiting, fatigue and jaundice.
Thanks to the trio’s discoveries, highly sensitive blood tests for the virus are now available and these have “essentially eliminated post-transfusion hepatitis in many parts of the world, greatly improving global health,” the Nobel committee said.
Their discoveries allowed the rapid development of antiviral drugs directed at Hepatitis C.
“For the first time in history, the disease can now be cured, raising hopes of eradicating Hepatitis C virus from the world population,” the jury said.
Alter, 85, told the Nobel Foundation he was “in shock” after receiving an early-morning call from the committee, saying he didn’t answer the first two times.
“The third time I got up angrily to answer it… and it was Stockholm,” he said.
“To see so many people get cured, and nobody getting post-transfusion hepatitis, that’s astounding (and) nothing I’ve ever thought would happen,” he said.
Prior to the trio’s work, the discovery of the Hepatitis A and B viruses had been critical steps forward – the discovery of Hepatitis B won the Nobel Medicine Prize in 1976 – but the majority of blood-borne hepatitis cases remained unexplained.
The discovery of Hepatitis C virus revealed the cause of the remaining cases of chronic hepatitis, and “made possible blood tests and new medicines that have saved millions of lives,” the Nobel committee said.
Alter was credited for his pioneering work in the 1970s studying the occurrence of hepatitis in patients who had received blood transfusions, determining that their illness was neither Hepatitis A or B.
Houghton built on Alter’s work to isolate the genetic sequence of the new virus.
Rice, 68, subsequently completed the puzzle by using genetic engineering to prove that it was the new strain alone – Hepatitis C – that was causing patients to get sick.
Rice, who works at Rockefeller University in New York, called the trio’s building-block discoveries “a success story for biomedical science.”
“We’re seeing an amazing follow-up example of that with the pandemic. The number of groups that have stepped up to work on SARS-COVID-2, the pace at which new discoveries are being made that I hope will impact the control of the pandemic, is really staggering,” he told the Nobel Foundation in an interview.
The trio will share the prize sum of 10 million Swedish kronor (about $1.1 million, 950,000 euros).
Houghton, Alter and Rice would normally receive their prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist Alfred Nobel who created the prizes in his will.
But the in-person ceremony has been canceled this year due to the pandemic and replaced with a televised ceremony showing the laureates receiving their awards in their home countries.
Their award comes as the hunt for a coronavirus vaccine has put the global spotlight on their field.
Both Rice and Houghton, a University of Alberta professor, are currently involved in efforts to find a vaccine for COVID-19.
No prizes were expected to be awarded this year directly linked to the coronavirus, as Nobel prize-winning research usually takes many years to be verified.
But Nobel medicine committee chair Patrik Ernfors said Monday’s prize was “relatively easy to relate to today’s situation.”
“The first thing you need to do is to identify the causing virus, and once that has been done, that is the starting point for the development of drugs to treat the disease and also to develop vaccines against the disorder. So the actual viral discovery itself is a critical moment.”
The 2020 Nobel season continues Tuesday, October 6, with the physics prize, with astrophysicists Shep Doeleman of the US and Germany’s Heino Falcke seen as possible winners for work that led to the first directly observed image of a black hole in April 2019.
American mathematician Peter Shor who paved the way for today’s research on quantum computers, or France’s Alain Aspect for his work on quantum entanglement, have also been mentioned.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 5, 2020 5:45 PM PHT"

The medicine prize announcement, due at 11:30 am (0930 GMT), will be followed by the physics prize on Tuesday and chemistry on Wednesday.
The most closely-watched awards – for literature and peace – will follow on Thursday and Friday, while the economics prize wraps things up on Monday, October 12.
This year, the coronavirus pandemic has put the global spotlight on research.
“The pandemic is a big crisis for mankind, but it illustrates how important science is,” Nobel Foundation head Lars Heikensten said.
No prizes are expected to be awarded this year for work directly linked to the new coronavirus, as Nobel prizewinning research usually takes many years to be verified.
The prize-awarding committees are “not in any way influenced by what is happening in the world at the time,” Erling Norrby, the former permanent secretary of the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences which awards the science prizes, told AFP.
“It takes time before a prize can mature, I would say at least 10 years before you can fully understand the impact” of a discovery, Norrby, himself a virologist, said.
The work of the various prize committees is shrouded in secrecy and the names of the nominees are not disclosed for 50 years, leading to rampant speculation.
Swedish public radio SR and the country’s biggest daily Dagens Nyheter both suggested Monday’s medicine prize could go to French-born Australian Jacques Miller and Max Cooper of the US for their discoveries of T-cells and B-cells in the 1960s, which led to breakthroughs in cancer and virus research.
The pair won the prestigious Lasker Prize in the US last year.
Or the nod could go to Lebanese-born American geneticist Huda Zoghbi for her discovery of a genetic mutation that leads to the brain disorder Rett Syndrome, both SR and Dagens Nyheter said.
Dagens Nyheter also tipped American Mary-Claire King, who discovered the BRCA1 gene responsible for a hereditary form of breast cancer, and researchers who worked on a cure for Hepatitis C, Ralf Bartenschlager of Germany and Americans Charles Rice and Michael Sofia – a trio also awarded the Lasker Prize in 2016.
Two names mentioned frequently are Emmanuelle Charpentier of France and Jennifer Doudna of the US, for their gene-editing technique known as the CRISPR-Cas9 DNA snipping tool, a type of genetic “scissors” used to cut out a mutated gene in a human embryo and replace it with a corrected version.
Chinese-born American Feng Zhang also claims to have discovered the technique, which could be eligible for both the medicine and chemistry prize.
Others also mentioned include immunologists Marc Feldmann of Australia and Indian-born British researcher Ravinder Maini, for work on rheumatoid arthritis, and American oncologist Dennis Slamon for research on breast cancer and the drug treatment Herceptin.
For Tuesday’s physics prize, astrophysicists Shep Doeleman of the US and Germany’s Heino Falcke could win for work that led to the first directly observed image of a black hole in April 2019, according to Dagens Nyheter.
SR meanwhile saw it going to American mathematician Peter Shor who paved the way for today’s research on quantum computers, or France’s Alain Aspect for his work on quantum entanglement.
For chemistry, SR predicted the honor could go to Christopher Murray for his work on semiconductor nanocrystals or to US gene sequencing pioneer Leroy Hood, while Dagens Nyheter tipped Americans Harry Gray, Richard Holm and Stephen Lippard for work in the field of bioinorganic chemistry.
Nobel watchers say the peace prize could go to press freedom champions such as Reporters Without Borders or the Committee to Protect Journalists, climate activists such as Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement, or an organization like the World Food Program, the World Health Organization, or Transparency International.
Stockholm’s literary circles saw Canadian poet Anne Carson and American-Caribbean writer Jamaica Kincaid as strong candidates for the literature prize, while Canada’s Margaret Atwood and US authors Marilynn Robinson and Joyce Carol Oates have made Nobel buzz for years.
Kenya’s Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Hungary’s Peter Nadas, Albania’s Ismael Kadare, Korea’s Ko Un, and France’s Michel Houellebecq are also frequently mentioned, while British novelist Hilary Mantel is a recent addition.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 5, 2020 11:03 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/what-you-need-to-know-about-regeneron-covid-19-treatment/,What you need to know about Regeneron’s COVID-19 treatment,"President Donald Trump was treated Friday, October 2, for COVID-19 with a high-dose of the experimental antibody drug developed by the US biotech firm Regeneron.
What is it, how far along are its clinical trials, and why do some experts disagree with using a medicine before it’s been approved?
Here’s what you need to know.
Regeneron’s treatment, called REGN-COV2, is a combination or “cocktail” of two antibodies: infection-fighting proteins that were developed to bind to the part of the new coronavirus that it uses to invade human cells.
The antibodies attach themselves to different parts of the virus’ “spike protein,” distorting its structure – similar in a way to knocking a key out of shape so it no longer fits its lock.
Vaccines work by teaching the body to make its own antibodies, but scientists are also testing ready-made antibodies from convalescent plasma, taken from the blood of recovered patients.
But it is not possible to make convalescent plasma a mass treatment.
Researchers can also comb through antibodies produced by recovered patients and select the most effective out of thousands, and then manufacture them at scale.
In a paper published in Science in June, Regeneron scientists described how they selected the two best antibodies from both recovered human patients and infected mice that were genetically modified to give them human-like immune systems.
In another paper in the same journal, scientists argued that by using two antibodies, they had guarded against the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 might randomly mutate to evade the blocking action of one, and then go on to become the dominant strain of the virus.
The company used the same “humanized mouse” technology to develop a triple-antibody cocktail which was shown to be effective against Ebola last year.
“That’s part of what’s giving us confidence, the platform has been tried and has been shown to be to work very, very well,” Christos Kyratsous, Regeneron’s lead infectious disease scientist told AFP in March.
The treatments are given by an intravenous drip.
Clinical trials are being carried out to test the drug’s safety and efficacy at different dose levels and to compare it against a placebo, to answer this question.
On Tuesday, the firm announced some results from an early stage clinical trial, saying that its treatment reduced the viral load and recovery time in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
The results related to 275 patients, and Regeneron’s president George Yancopoulos said the company had begun talks with regulatory authorities – presumably for temporary approval before full licensure.
But the detailed data hasn’t yet been made public or peer-reviewed.
In terms of safety, it said “infusion reactions” were seen in 4 patients – two on placebo and two on the drug, while “serious adverse events” occurred in two placebo patients and one on the drug. No one died.
The company did not detail what these side-effects were, but Arun Swaminath, a doctor at New York’s Lenox Hill Hospital, said that in general, mild reactions to IV-therapies include fevers, chills, and fatigue.
More serious symptoms include chest pain and shortness of breath.
The outpatient trial has now moved to late-stage.
Regeneron is also running late-stage trials for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the UK and for the drug’s potential use to prevent household contacts of COVID-19 patients from being infected.
The decision to give Trump the treatment before the trials have even produced enough data for emergency use authorization has puzzled some scientists.
Carla Perissinotto, a geriatrician and professor at the University of California, San Francisco, told AFP that using unapproved treatments on a “compassionate use” basis normally happens when everything else has failed.
“The risk of having side effects is so much greater, that I usually am very cautious about anything that’s experimental and not proven,” she said.
Jeremy Faust, a public health expert at Harvard, said it raised uncomfortable possibilities: either the president’s team had not understood the scientific process, or they had understood but were overridden by Trump on someone else’s advice.
“People will see this and they’ll think that this is the treatment you should have – and if you don’t give it to other people who have coronavirus that we’re denying them special treatment.
“In reality that’s not the case…we shouldn’t be treating the president as a guinea pig.”",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 5, 2020 8:53 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/trump-taking-latest-covid-19-treatments-the-conversation/,Trump is taking the latest in COVID-19 treatments – here’s what doctors know works against the virus,"With 74-year-old President Trump and 50-year-old first lady Melania Trump testing positive for the coronavirus, what are the best proven treatments for them and other patients?
We are both physician-scientists at the University of Virginia. We care for COVID-19 patients and conduct research to find better ways to diagnose and treat COVID-19.
Here we are sharing what physicians have learned over the past eight months treating various stages of this disease. Early in the year, there were few known treatments for people who showed severe COVID-19 symptoms apart from sustaining them on ventilators. Now, several months later, there are a handful of treatments, including drugs, that give doctors far better tools to heal patients, particularly very ill ones.
Men are one-and-a-half times more likely to die, and an 80-year-old has a twentyfold greater risk of death than a 50-year-old. In addition to age and male gender, obesity; diabetes; recent cancer diagnosis; chronic heart, lung and liver disease; stroke; and dementia all are associated with an increased risk of dying from COVID-19. Based on these criteria, the president falls into a higher-risk category based on male gender and age.
The approach to therapy differs depending on the stage of the illness.
It is therefore important to not only diagnose COVID-19 but to define whether the infection is asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. Also, how sick a person is – whether it’s a mild, moderate, severe or critical case – changes how a patient is treated.
Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection is defined as having a positive diagnostic test for COVID-19 (a PCR or antigen detection test) without symptoms of infection.
There is currently no known effective treatment for this stage. Someone with asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection should isolate themself at home for 10 days so as not to expose others.
Symptoms of mild COVID-19 infection can include fever, cough, loss of taste or smell, muscle aches, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, congestion and runny nose.
Someone with mild COVID-19 does not have shortness of breath, chest pain or evidence of pneumonia during a chest X-ray. The exception to this is children with mild disease who may still have an abnormal X-ray.
There are no treatments that have been demonstrated to benefit those with mild disease. However, such patients should be well versed on the symptoms of moderate illness, so that they and others recognize if they progress to moderate illness. This is important because progression to more severe disease can be rapid – typically five to 10 days after initial symptoms.
Moderate illness is defined as shortness of breath, chest pain, or on a chest X-ray, evidence of pneumonia but without hypoxia (low blood oxygen levels).
There currently is no known effective therapy for moderate illness.
Severe illness is identified by a rapid breathing rate (greater than 30 breaths per minute) or low oxygen levels in the blood, which is called hypoxia. Also, evidence of pneumonia affecting more than half of the lungs, as diagnosed on a chest X-ray, is a sign of a severe case.
Controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that the antiviral drug remdesivir hastens recovery for patients with severe but not critical illness.
In addition the anti-inflammatory steroid medicine dexamethasone (a prednisonelike drug) decreases mortality.
Critical illness occurs when the patient becomes so sick that vital organs begin to fail and they require medicines or other therapies to support these vital functions.
If failure of the lungs is severe enough, physicians may put the patient on a mechanical ventilator or high quantities of oxygen. There is no evidence that remdesivir treatment is beneficial during this critical phase. Dexamethasone is still recommended for treatment because it has been shown to decrease mortality.
Some treatments that have been shown to be ineffective include chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
Other potential treatments are still in the middle of clinical trials to test whether they are effective. These include human convalescent plasma, which contains antibodies that should bind to the virus and prevent it from entering cells.
There are also drugs to modulate the immune response, such as interferons and inhibitors of IL-6, which in some cases may prevent a harmful overreaction of the immune system, commonly referred to as cytokine storm.
Right now there is no approved treatment for outpatients with asymptomatic or mild to moderate COVID-19. But this appears to be changing, with Eli Lilly’s and Regeneron’s release of clinical trial data on the use of laboratory-manufactured antibodies against the spike glycoprotein of the new coronavirus.
In this approach, as with convalescent plasma, the antibodies work by binding to the virus and blocking it from entering cells and multiplying. This could be particularly effective early on in infection before illness becomes severe.
In an early preview of data from an ongoing phase three clinical trial, subjects with COVID-19 who received an injection of a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein had symptoms that lasted only seven days rather than 13. The amount of virus remaining in the nasopharynx – the upper part of the throat behind the nose – was also reduced.
An update from the president’s physician in the afternoon of October 2 indicated that, as a precautionary measure, the president received an infusion of Regeneron’s antibody cocktail. This approach and others like it are currently receiving high-priority testing from the National Institutes of Health to determine whether they are safe and effective.",William Petri,"Oct 3, 2020 10:52 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/second-russian-virus-vaccine-passes-early-trials/,Second Russian virus vaccine passes early trials – report,"Early clinical trials of a second Russian coronavirus vaccine have proved successful, its developer said Thursday, October 1, after Russia boasted of approving the world’s first vaccine.
Russia’s Vektor – a top-secret state virology research centre in Siberia – said that early-stage trials were successful for its own experimental vaccine, named EpiVacCorona.
“The first two phases of clinical trials demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of the EpiVacCorona vaccine,” Vektor’s press department told the Interfax news agency.
Russia announced in August that it had developed the world’s first registered vaccine – named “Sputnik V” after the world’s first satellite.
It raised concerns among Western scientists by announcing that the vaccine – developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya research center – had received approval before full clinical trials have been completed.
Vektor said it would be possible to make the final conclusions about the efficacy of its vaccine, based on peptides that trigger an immune response, after post-approval clinical trials have been completed.
Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko told President Vladimir Putin this week that Vektor’s vaccine could be approved by the ministry in 3 weeks.
Vektor said post-registration clinical trials would begin on 5,000 volunteers in Siberia.
The lab said there would be a separate clinical trial involving 150 volunteers who are over 60 years of age.
After that Vektor will begin placebo-controlled trials on 5,000 Russian volunteers between the ages of 18 and 60.
The EpiVacCorona vaccine is a two-component vaccine, and the interval between the administration of the first and second components is 21 days.
Russia plans to manufacture an initial 10,000 doses, Vektor said, with production expected to begin in November.
Vektor declined to comment when contacted by AFP and referred all queries to Rospotrebnadzor, the country’s consumer safety watchdog.
The watchdog declined immediate comment.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/donald-trump-biggest-driver-covid-19-misinformation/,Donald Trump biggest driver of COVID-19 misinformation – study,"US President Donald Trump has been the world’s biggest driver of COVID-19 misinformation during the pandemic, a study from Cornell University said Thursday, October 1.
A team from the Cornell Alliance for Science evaluated 38 million articles published by English-language, traditional media worldwide between January 1 and May 26 of this year.
The database they used aggregates coverage from countries such as the United States, Britain, India, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and other African and Asian nations.
They identified 522,472 news articles that reproduced or amplified misinformation related to the coronavirus pandemic, or what the World Health Organization has called the “infodemic.”
These were categorized into 11 main sub-topics, ranging from conspiracy theories to attacks on top scientist Anthony Fauci to the idea that the virus is a bioweapon unleashed by China.
But the most popular topic by far was what the study authors termed “miracle cures,” which appeared in 295,351 articles – more than the other 10 topics combined.
The authors found that comments by President Trump drove major spikes in the “miracle cures” topic, led by his April 24 press briefing where he mused on the possibility of using disinfectants inside the body to cure the coronavirus.
Similar spikes were seen when he promoted unproven treatments like hydroxychloroquine.
“We conclude therefore that the president of the United States was likely the largest driver of the COVID-19 misinformation ‘infodemic,'” the team wrote.
Sarah Evanega, who led the study and is director of the Cornell Alliance for Science, said: “If people are misled by unscientific and unsubstantiated claims about the disease, they may be less likely to observe official guidance and thus risk spreading the virus.”
Co-author Jordan Adams, a data analyst at Cision Insights that provided the database, added: “One of the more interesting aspects of the data collection process was discovering the staggering amount of misinformation coverage directly linked to the public comments of a small number of individuals.”
After miracle cures, the second-most prevalent misinformation topic was that the pandemic was created to advance a “new world order.”
Next came the claim that the pandemic was a hoax for political gain by the US Democratic Party, followed by conspiracies alleging the virus was a bioweapon released by a laboratory in Wuhan, China.
Conspiracy theories linking the pandemic to philanthropist Bill Gates came next, then the hoax that COVID-19 symptoms are caused by 5G phone networks, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and the notion that the virus is a form of population control.
Attacks on US government scientist Fauci, references to the debunked “Plandemic” video, and blaming the virus on Chinese people consuming bat soup rounded off the list.
The study’s authors found there was some effort to correct the misinformation in the form of fact-checking articles, which appeared 183,717 times during the period studied.
They also tracked how the stories were shared on social media, finding that the posts elicited 36 million engagements, three-quarters of them on Facebook.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/united-states-women-drank-more-during-pandemic/,US women drank more during pandemic – study,"Alcohol consumption among women in the United States rose during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new study published Tuesday, September 29.
Researchers found that women drank about 5.4 days per month compared to their 2019 average of 4.6 days
What’s more, women drank heavily on average 0.6 days a month during the pandemic compared to 0.4 before, according to the study in JAMA Network Open.
Heavy drinking was defined as 5  or more drinks for men and 4 or more drinks for women within a couple of hours.
The authors used survey data from April-June of 2019 to establish a baseline and compared those responses to May-June 2020, when bars and restaurants were again open in many parts of the US after virus-related shutdowns.
The data firm Nielsen had previously reported a 21% increase in off-premise alcohol sales in the week ending June 13, 2020 compared to the year before, but it wasn’t clear how much more people were actually drinking.
This gap has now been partly filled by the new study, which compared the responses of the same 1,500 people in the two waves.
The results also suggested that men drank more frequently, but the data was inconclusive.
What was more certain was men continued to be the biggest drinkers, with around 23 drinks per month compared to 15 for women.
The authors cautioned that a limitation of their study was it was based on self-reporting, which could have distorted the results",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 1, 2020 3:43 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-will-not-be-ready-us-election/,Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine won’t be ready by US election – report,"US biotech firm Moderna won’t seek an emergency use authorization for its coronavirus vaccine before November 25, its CEO told the Financial Times on Wednesday, September 30.
The news deals a blow to President Donald Trump’s hopes of having an injection ready before the election to give his campaign a much-needed boost.
Stephane Bancel told the newspaper: “November 25 is the time we will have enough safety data to be able to put into an EUA file that we would send to the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) — assuming that the safety data is good, i.e. a vaccine is deemed to be safe.”
Trump, whose approval has taken a hit over his handling of the COVID-19 crisis, has frequently hinted a vaccine could be ready before the November 3 vote.
This has raised concern among experts that his administration may attempt to interfere with the regulatory process for political reasons.
The Republican repeated his claim on Tuesday night, during a debate with his Democratic rival, former vice president Joe Biden.
“It’s a possibility that we’ll have the answer before November 1,” he said.
Moderna’s vaccine is one of 11 experimental vaccines in final stage trials.
Another is being developed by Pfizer, whose CEO Albert Bourla has taken the position that his company may have a clear answer about whether their shot works by October.
Most experts are skeptical of the claim, believing that the ongoing trials will not have sufficient statistical data to prove the drug’s safety and effectiveness by that time.
Speaking to the Washington Post on Tuesday, Bourla denied he was attempting to curry favor with the president by making his October claim.
“For me, the election day is an artificial day. The end of October is an artificial day. This is how we operate. If we can bring it earlier, we will,” he said.",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 1, 2020 11:55 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/un-needs-immediate-infusion-15-billion-global-vaccine-fund/,UN needs ‘immediate infusion’ of $15B for global vaccine fund,"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called Wednesday, September 30, for an “immediate infusion” of $15 billion to a global pool for the procurement and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines at a virtual summit hosted by the world body.
The ACT-Accelerator, led by the World Health Organization, has received around $3 billion of the $38 billion needed to meet the goal of producing and delivering two billion vaccine doses, 245 million treatments, and 500 million diagnostic tests over the next year.
Notable new pledges included an additional 100 million euros ($117 million) by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, beyond the 675 million euros Germany has already committed.
Britain’s foreign minister Dominic Raab said his country, which has committed 250 million pounds ($320 million), would spend another pound for every 4 dollars committed by others, up to an additional 250 million pounds.
Sweden’s Prime Minister Stefan Lofven pledged $10 million while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau touted a Can$440 million ($332 million) commitment made last week, half of which will go to low or middle-income countries.
The World Bank’s president David Malpass said he had proposed “up to $12 billion of fast-track financing” to countries for the purchase and deployment of COVID-19 vaccine, also previously announced.
“These resources are crucial now to avoid losing the window of opportunity for advance purchase and production, to build stocks in parallel with licensing, to boost research, and to help countries prepare to optimize the new vaccines when they arrive,” Guterres said.
“Despite extraordinary efforts to contain its spread, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the world, reaching one million lives lost this week,” he added.
“It is in every country’s national and economic self-interest to work together to massively expand access to tests and treatments, and to support a vaccine as a global public good.”
Addressing the summit, Bill Gates announced his foundation had signed a new agreement with 16 biotech firms to expand global access to vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.
Gates said that the world was on the brink of a “great scientific achievement” in the form of a vaccine.
But he added that the world’s low and low middle income countries, which made up nearly half of the global population, were only on track to cover 14% of their people with a COVID-19 vaccine.
Alex Gorsky, the CEO of Johnson and Johnson, which is part of the agreement with the Gates Foundation, told the summit his company planned to allocate 500 million vaccine doses for lower income countries by the middle of next year.
WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said he was “grateful for the generous financial commitments made” but added there remained a “significant funding gap to close.”",Agence France-Presse,"Oct 1, 2020 10:49 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/first-man-cured-hiv-dies-cancer-september-2020/,1st man cured of HIV dies of cancer – charity,"The first person to be cured of HIV, Timothy Ray Brown – known as the “Berlin Patient” – has died after a battle with cancer, the International Aids Society (IAS) announced Wednesday, September 30.
Brown made medical history and became a symbol of hope for the tens of millions of people living with the virus that causes AIDS when he was cured more than a decade ago.
He had been living with a recurrence of leukemia for several months and received hospice care at his home in Palm Springs, California.
“On behalf of all its members…the IAS sends its condolences to Timothy’s partner, Tim, and his family and friends,” said IAS President Adeeba Kamarulzaman.
“We owe Timothy and his doctor, Gero Hutter, a great deal of gratitude for opening the door for scientists to explore the concept that a cure for HIV is possible.”
Brown was diagnosed with HIV while was studying in Berlin in 1995. A decade later, he was diagnosed with leukemia, a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow.
To treat his leukemia, his doctor at the Free University of Berlin used a stem cell transplant from a donor who had a rare genetic mutation that gave him natural resistance to HIV, hoping it may wipe out both diseases.
It took two painful and dangerous procedures, but it was a success: in 2008 Brown was declared free of the two ailments, and was initially dubbed “the Berlin Patient” at a medical conference to preserve his anonymity.
Two years later, he decided to break his silence and went on to become a public figure, giving speeches and interviews and starting his own foundation.
“I am living proof that there could be a cure for AIDS,” he told Agence France-Presse in 2012. “It’s very wonderful, being cured of HIV.”
Ten years after Brown was cured, a second HIV sufferer – dubbed “the London Patient” – was revealed to be in remission 19 months after undergoing a similar procedure.
The patient, Adam Castillejo, is currently HIV-free. In August a California woman was reported to have no traces of HIV despite not using anti-retroviral treatment.
It is thought she may be the first person to be cured of HIV without undergoing the risky bone marrow treatment.
Sharon Lewin, president-elect of the IAS and director of the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia, praised Brown as a “champion and advocate” of a cure for HIV.
“It is the hope of the scientific community that one day we can honor his legacy with a safe, cost-effective and widely accessible strategy to achieve HIV remission and curs using gene edition or techniques that boost immune control,” she said.",Agence France-Presse,"Sep 30, 2020 6:56 PM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/regeneron-says-early-trials-promising-covid-19-treatment/,Regeneron says early trials promising for COVID-19 treatment,"The US biotech firm Regeneron said Tuesday, September 29, its antibody cocktail against the coronavirus reduced viral load and recovery time in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients during an early-stage clinical trial.
“We are highly encouraged by the robust and consistent nature of these initial data,” said George Yancopoulos, the company’s president and chief scientific officer.
“We have begun discussing our findings with regulatory authorities while continuing our ongoing trial,” he added.
The results related to the first 275 patients recruited into Regeneron’s Phase 1 trial. The patients were randomized to receive either a low-dose, high-dose, or placebo of the drug, and they were also classed by whether their bodies had mounted their own antibody response or not.
The greatest treatment benefit was seen in patients who had not mounted their own effective immune response, which suggested the drug, called REGN-COV2, could act as a substitute in the absence of naturally occurring antibodies, according to Yancopoulos.
Regeneron said it would recruit 1,300 patients for the next stages of the outpatient trial. It is also concurrently running late-stage trials for hospitalized COVID-19 patients and for the drug’s potential use as a prophylaxis.
Antibodies are infection-fighting proteins made by the immune system that can bind to particular structures on the surfaces of pathogens and prevent them from invading cells.
Vaccines work by teaching the body to make its own antibodies, while scientists are also testing ready-made antibodies from the blood of recovered patients, called convalescent plasma.
But it is not possible to make convalescent plasma a mass treatment.
Researchers can also comb through the antibodies produced by recovered patients and select the most effective out of thousands, and then manufacture it at scale.
Regeneron uses a multi-antibody strategy to decrease the chances that the virus will mutate in order to evade the blocking action of a single antibody, an approach the company detailed in a recent study in Science.
Last year, a triple-antibody cocktail developed by Regeneron was shown to be effective against the Ebola virus.
Also on Tuesday, the biotech firm Moderna – one of the frontrunners in the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine – reported results from the Phase 1 portion of its clinical trial that showed its drug was safe and generated a strong immune response among a group of 40 older adults.
Moderna’s Phase 3 trial, the final phase before possible approval, is also underway and could report interim results by the end of the year.

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/boost-covid-19-vaccine-doses-planned-poor/,Boost in COVID-19 vaccine doses planned for poor as virus rages on,"Up to 100 million additional doses of any eventual COVID-19 vaccines will be secured for delivery to poorer countries in 2021, health groups announced Tuesday, September 29, as the virus showed no sign of receding after claiming more than one million lives around the world.
The announcement doubles the number of doses already secured from the Serum Institute of India by the Gavi vaccine alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, following an initial agreement last month.
The public-private health partnership stressed that the eventual total is “potentially several times” greater, and said the price would be capped at $3 per dose.
“No country, rich or poor, should be left at the back of the queue when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines; this collaboration brings us another step closer to achieving this goal,” Gavi chief Seth Berkley said.
As 9 vaccine candidates are in last-stage trials, the World Bank said Tuesday it had asked its board of directors to approve $12 billion to help poor countries purchase and distribute vaccines.
A World Bank spokesman said that “the global economy will not recover fully until people feel they can live, socialize, work, and travel with confidence.”
As humanity struggles against COVID-19, the World Health Organization said this week that some 120 million rapid tests will soon be made available to low- and middle-income countries if funding can be secured.
The kits – faster, cheaper, and easier to administer than standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab tests, but also less reliable – will be rolled out across 133 countries in the next 6 months.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday said that “responsible leadership matters” in steering the world through the pandemic.
“Science matters. Cooperation matters – and misinformation kills,” he warned, urging people to respect familiar infection control measures like hand-washing, distancing, and mask-wearing.
Case numbers are climbing rapidly in Europe, where governments are clamping down on movement in an attempt to curb the surge.
Germany introduced new limits on the number of people who can attend private events, after Spain, France, Britain, and Northern Ireland all imposed fresh restrictions.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said “a reaction is necessary” after recent outbreaks were frequently traced to weddings and other gatherings.
In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared to share general confusion about his government’s measures, apologizing after wrongly saying that rules limiting gatherings in northeast England to no more than 6 people did not apply outdoors.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia said they were preparing to declare a state of emergency.
In Israel, which has the world’s highest infection rate per capita, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said Tuesday that there was “no way” the country’s second nationwide coronavirus lockdown would be lifted after 3 weeks as originally planned.
Across the Atlantic, former coronavirus hotspot New York’s rate of positive tests surged to more than 3% from below two in just 24 hours, authorities said, adding that Orthodox Jewish communities have faced a particularly sharp increase.
The figures were a “real cause for concern,” Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters as he introduced fines for those not wearing masks in public.
More than one in 10 of the 203,107 people who have so far died of coronavirus in the US were New Yorkers.
US President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden were gearing up for their first televised election debate, with the country’s troubled response to the virus likely to be a battleground.
Hours before the debate, the economic impact of the virus was highlighted by Disney saying it will cut 28,000 jobs from its US theme parks division.
Worldwide the virus has now infected almost 33.5 million people and killed over a million, according to an AFP tally compiled from official sources.
Mid-September saw a record rise in cases in most regions and the WHO has warned that virus deaths could even double to two million.
On Monday, the number of cases in India surpassed 6 million, with the country on course to overtake the US in the coming weeks as the nation with the most infections.
The country’s lead pandemic agency said Tuesday that as many as 60 million of India’s 1.3 billion population could already have been infected, based on a study of blood antibodies.",Agence France-Presse,"Sep 30, 2020 8:49 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/who-wants-120-million-rapid-virus-tests-poorer-states/,WHO wants 120M rapid virus tests for poorer states,"Some 120 million rapid tests for COVID-19 will be made available to poorer countries at $5 each, the World Health Organization announced Monday, September 28 – if it can find the money.
The WHO said the $600 million scheme would enable low- and middle-income countries to close the dramatic gap in testing for the new coronavirus, which has now killed more than a million people since first being recorded in China in December.
The quick tests, to be distributed across 133 countries over the next 6 months, are not as reliable as the regular PCR nasal swab tests but are far faster, cheaper, and easier to carry out.
“We have an agreement, we have seed funding and now we need the full amount of funds to buy these tests,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual press conference.
Last week, the WHO issued the first emergency-use listing for a quality, antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT), with others expected to follow.
“A substantial proportion of these rapid tests – 120 million – will be made available to low- and middle-income countries,” said Tedros.
“These tests provide reliable results in approximately 15 to 30 minutes, rather than hours or days, at a lower price, with less sophisticated equipment.
“This will enable the expansion of testing, particularly in hard-to-reach areas that do not have lab facilities or enough trained health workers to carry out PCR tests.”
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, which is co-convening the WHO-led pooled global search for COVID-19 diagnostics, is putting in $50 million from its COVID-19 response pot.
Global Fund executive director Peter Sands said the RDTs were no silver bullet but were a hugely valuable complement to PCR tests.
“Although they are a bit less accurate, they’re much faster, cheaper, and don’t require a lab,” said Sands.
“This will enable low- and middle-income countries to begin to close the dramatic gap in testing.”
Sands, said that currently, high-income countries were conducting 292 tests per day per 100,000 people; upper-middle-income countries 77; lower-middle-income countries, 61; and low-income countries, 14.
He said that if the poorest countries were testing at the same rate as the richest, 120 million tests would not last two weeks.
The tests could be used where PCR tests are unavailable; quickly testing contacts where a PCR test has confirmed a case; and in places with widespread community transmission.
Sands said the first orders were going in this week.
The tests are being produced by two companies: US multinational Abbott Laboratories and South Korea-based SD BioSensor.
The 120 million tests reflect 20% of the firms’  manufacturing capacity. The other 80% remain available for procurement.
By 1600 GMT Monday, the respiratory disease had claimed 1,002,432 victims from 33,178,275 recorded infections, according to an AFP tally collected from official sources.
“The current numbers are likely an under-estimate of the true toll,” said WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan.
He said Friday that another million deaths were “highly likely” before a vaccine comes around, unless countries and individuals take collective action to combat the spread of the virus.",Agence France-Presse,"Sep 29, 2020 10:56 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/how-the-coronavirus-spreads-through-the-air-5-essential-reads/,How the coronavirus spreads through the air: 5 essential reads,"Scientists have been warning for months that the coronavirus could be spread by aerosols – tiny respiratory droplets that people emit when they talk or sneeze and that can linger in the air.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention appeared to acknowledge that risk on Sept. 18. It posted guidance on its website listing aerosols among the ways the virus spreads and saying there was growing evidence the airborne particles can remain suspended and travel beyond 6 feet. But three days later, that guidance was gone. A note in its place said a draft had been posted in error and that the CDC was still working on the update.
That kind of shifting by the government can be confusing. In the following 5 articles recently published in The Conversation, we turned to scientists to help explain what aerosols are, how airborne particles can transmit the coronavirus and how to protect yourself.
When you talk or sing, the rush of air breaks up strands of mucus in your airways, sending droplets of it airborne.
While larger droplets quickly fall, tiny, light ones can linger in the air. If you’re infected, those droplets can contain the coronavirus, and early research suggests it can be viable for many minutes to hours.
Aerosol experts Byron Erath, Andrea Ferro and Goodarz Ahmadi of Clarkson University explained the mechanics of aerosols in a recent article for The Conversation.
They also discussed what people can do to protect themselves. “Wearing face coverings to decrease airborne exposure risk is critical,” they wrote, and “reducing the amount of time you spend in poorly ventilated, crowded areas is a good way to reduce airborne exposure risk.”
The common advice for social distancing is to stay 6 feet apart. It’s easy to remember, but it doesn’t account for all aerosol risks – particularly indoors.
Because people infected with SARS-CoV-2 can transmit large amounts of the virus, there is no safe distance in a poorly ventilated room, Erath, Ferro, Ahmadi and their Clarkson University colleague Suresh Dhaniyala wrote in a second article. Air currents from a fan or ventilation system can spread respiratory droplets farther than 6 feet. So can speaking loudly or singing, as superspreader events have shown.
The scientists used a smoky room analogy to illustrate the risk and suggested ways to manage it.
“Over time, it won’t matter where you are in the room,” they wrote. “While it’s not a perfect analogy, picturing how cigarette smoke moves through different environments, both indoors and outdoors, can help in visualizing how virus-laden droplets circulate in the air.”

A large number of COVID-19 cases have come from “superspreader” events where someone who is highly infectious spreads the virus to dozens of others.
Researchers in Hong Kong recently estimated that about 20% of the people infected there were responsible for 80% of the local coronavirus transmission. Choir practices, church services, nightclubs and a birthday party are just few of the documented superspreader events.
Elizabeth McGraw, who heads Pennsylvania State University’s Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, explained the evidence and the importance of superspreader events to the virus’s transmission in another article.
“The good news is that the right control practices specific to how pathogens are transmitted – hand-washing, masks, quarantine, vaccination, reducing social contacts and so on – can slow the transmission rate and halt a pandemic,” she wrote.
The way the virus spreads in the air is also a challenge for reopening businesses and schools.
Respiratory scientist Douglas Reed of the University of Pittsburgh examined studies that have shown how the virus has spread, including at a call center in South Korea, a restaurant in China and a choir practice in Washington state.
“The evidence strongly suggests that airborne transmission happens easily and is likely a significant driver of this pandemic. It must be taken seriously as people begin to venture back out into the world,” he wrote.
More research has been published since that article came out that also points to the virus spreading through the air. One review found adults who had tested positive for COVID-19 were about twice as likely to have dined at a restaurant than those who tested negative. Another described a large outbreak in one ward of a nursing home with poor ventilation. Two other studies traced how the virus spread during airline flights.
A separate article by Kacey Ernst and Paloma Beamer of the University of Arizona looked at the risks in flying during the pandemic and, for those who must get on an airplane, how to stay as safe as possible.
With temperatures getting cooler, it’s going to be harder to keep windows open to bring fresh air into enclosed spaces, and that includes public transportation and school buses.
Jesse Capecelatro, a mechanical engineer at the University of Michigan, broke down the risks of the coronavirus spreading inside a school bus and offered eight recommendations.
“Short trips. Masks for everyone. Far fewer passengers than before,” he wrote. “Those are my top recommendations for how America’s school buses should take kids to and from school during the pandemic.” – The Conversation|Rappler.com

https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/china-annual-production-capacity-virus-vaccine-reach-610-million/,China says annual production capacity of virus vaccine to reach 610 million,"China’s COVID-19 vaccine development program is in a “leading position” and Beijing expects annual production capacity to reach over 600 million doses by the end of the year, officials said Friday, September 25.
China has been bullish about the development of its coronavirus vaccine as scientists around the world race to halt the deadly pathogen which has caused global chaos and killed almost a million people.
Health officials told reporters at a press conference Friday that China expects to be able to produce 610 million vaccine doses annually by the end of this year, and at least one billion doses annually next year.
Eleven Chinese vaccines have now entered clinical trials, with 4 in Phase Three trials that are “progressing smoothly,” said Wu Yuanbin from the Ministry of Science and Technology.
“At present, China’s Covid-19 vaccine research and development work is overall in a leading position,” said Wu.
“We’ve seen that the vaccines’ safety is good and there have been no serious adverse reactions.”
Hundreds of thousands of essential workers at ports, hospitals and other high-risk areas have already been given an experimental vaccine since July, officials said, claiming that the program had also gained the support of the World Health Organization (WHO).
“The safety of the emergency use vaccine has been fully authenticated, but its efficacy has not been fully certified,” said Zheng Zhongwei, an official at the National Health Commission.
“Up until now, there has not been one serious adverse reaction from all participants in the Covid emergency vaccine program,” Zheng added. He insisted the final vaccine would be “affordable for the general public.”
There are 59 vaccines currently under research in China in total, according to Wu.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has previously declared that Chinese vaccines would be made a “global public good.”
Two vaccines produced by China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a subsidiary of Sinopharm, have been tested on over 35,000 people during Phase Three trials in the Middle East, Wu said.
Sinovac – another leading vaccine producer – has also been carrying out Phase Three trials in countries in South America and Southeast Asia, Wu added.
A vaccine jointly developed by CanSino Biologics and the Chinese military has been approved for Phase Three trials in countries in Europe and Asia.

“I’d personally say that I would not get vaccinated because I tread very carefully on this issue,” said Sergei Ryzhikov, the 46-year-old leader of the next expedition to the ISS in October.
He and other cosmonauts wore face masks at the Star City training center outside Moscow during an online news conference.
The cosmonaut’s comments came after Putin touted Russia’s coronavirus vaccine developed in record time and named “Sputnik V” after the Soviet-era satellite that was the first launched into space in 1957.
“As soon as the vaccine is tried and tested and proves its reliability then a decision will be taken to recommend that cosmonauts get vaccinated,” said fellow cosmonaut, 37-year-old Sergei Kud-Sverchkov.
He said the decision was down to the doctors in charge of cosmonauts’ healthcare including immunization.
Russia has raised concerns among Western scientists by announcing that its vaccine had received approval before full clinical trials have been completed.
While the vaccine showed promising results in early trials, Russia has not yet completed the final phase of clinical testing, in which large numbers of people receive either the vaccine or a placebo.
Nevertheless, Russia has already vaccinated high-profile officials including Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin. Putin has said that one of his daughters was vaccinated, suffering only a mild reaction.
Astronauts routinely undergo a quarantine period before blasting off to space.
“The International Space Station is the safest place now,” Ryzhikov added.

https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/hardcore-grandma-ageing-fitness-buff-proves-hit-china/,‘Hardcore grandma’ – Ageing fitness buff proves hit in China,"Chen Jifang hits the gym for at least two hours every day and has the physique to prove it. At nearly 70, she’s being held up as a shining example as China orders its vast population to get fit and lose the bulge.
The grandmother from Shanghai has become a minor celebrity in recent months as her newfound and unlikely love for working out made national headlines.
After becoming a gym bunny in December 2018, Chen lost 14 kilos (30 pounds) in 3 months and now sports the kind of flat stomach and toned muscles that people decades younger aspire to.
She has also built up a fan base on social media, clocking up 410,000 followers on TikTok with her impressive exercise routines and encouraging others to follow her example.
A post on the video-sharing app of the pensioner doing a rapid set of lung-busting squats and lunges has been viewed more than one million times.
“I will work out as long as I’m still alive,” Chen, who turned 68 this year, tells AFP at a gym in a Shanghai suburb.
Chinese state media have reported Chen’s story with gusto because it fits the government’s drive to encourage people of all ages to get fitter.
That message has been amplified this year by the assertion that being fit is one way to help beat the coronavirus, which emerged in Wuhan in late 2019.
Xinmin Evening News labelled Chen “hardcore grandma” and Xinhua news agency called her “heavy-lifting granny.” She has also been featured on television.
For Chen, who worked for a food company before retiring, pumping iron has come late in life.
She began going to the gym following a chance meeting with a personal trainer, propelled into action by worries about her deteriorating health and weight gain.
But she has shed the flab and says that last year she was given a clear bill of health by doctors, having previously had problems with a fatty liver, high blood pressure, and eye cataracts.
Chen, who has a grandson aged 14, recalled the shocked looks she got the first time she walked through the gym door.
“They found it very strange, they don’t usually see people at such an old age who care about their health so much,” she says.
Under the watchful eye of a personal trainer, and barely pausing for breath, Chen ploughs through a series of exercises using weight machines, free weights, and other dynamic movements designed to burn fat and gain muscle.
Despite her active lifestyle, Chen has no sporting background and says she barely got out of bed when her daughter was very young because her body was so weak from giving birth.
“If your muscles are strong and powerful it will protect your bones if you fall, because the elderly are most afraid of falling,” she said.
“In fact, I also fell once and fell terribly, hurting my forehead, hips, knees and toes.
“They saw an old lady with white hair lying on the ground and passersby started calling an ambulance.
“I said ‘don’t,’ and I got up. I said that I had been exercising, so I’m fine.”
On a typical warm autumn evening, so-called “dancing aunties” pack out Shanghai’s parks and public spaces. For many women of middle age and upwards, square dancing is the only form of exercise they get.
“No matter how hard you square-dance, you can’t reach my current condition,” said Chen, flexing her biceps for the camera.
She added: “At our age it is not how much money you have, who you are, or how good your children are.
“You just want a medical record as short as possible.”",Agence France-Presse,"Sep 24, 2020 11:45 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/amazon-city-manaus-may-have-reached-herd-immunity/,Amazon city of Manaus may have reached ‘herd immunity’ – study,"The Brazilian city of Manaus, which was devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, may have suffered so many infections that its population now benefits from “herd immunity,” according to a preliminary study.
Published on the website medRxiv, the study analyzed infection data with mathematical modeling to estimate that 66% of the population had antibodies to the new coronavirus in Manaus, where the pandemic’s passage was as fast as it was brutal.
That may be sufficiently high to have reached the threshold of herd immunity, in which enough members of a population are immune to a disease that it can no longer spread effectively, said the study’s authors, a group of 34 Brazilian and international researchers.
“The unusually high infection rate suggests that herd immunity played a significant role in determining the size of the epidemic,” they wrote in the study, which has yet to undergo peer review.
“All signs indicate that it was the very fact of being so exposed to the virus that brought about the reduction in the number of new cases and deaths in Manaus,” the study’s coordinator, University of Sao Paulo medical professor Ester Sabino, told the Sao Paulo State Research Support Foundation (Fapesp), which helped fund the study.
Situated in the Amazon rainforest, Manaus was the scene of gruesome images of overrun hospitals, mass graves, and corpses piled in refrigerator trucks when the pandemic was at its peak there in May.
But deaths in the city of 2.2 million people have fallen dramatically in recent weeks, to an average of just 3.6 per day over the past 14 days.
Manaus is now one of the cities reopening fastest from lockdown in Brazil, the country with the second-highest death toll worldwide, after the United States, with nearly 139,000 people killed.
That includes schools, businesses, nightlife, and its famed opera house.
However, health experts cautioned that attempting to reach herd immunity was a dangerous path for policy makers.
“Community immunity via natural infection is not a strategy, it’s a sign that a government failed to control an outbreak and is paying for that in lives lost,” tweeted Florian Krammer, professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.
Other experts cautioned that immunity to the virus may be short-lived.
Manaus has registered 2,462 deaths from COVID-19.
If it were a country, it would have the second-highest mortality rate in the world, at 100.7 deaths per 100,000 population.",Agence France-Presse,"Sep 24, 2020 9:59 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/former-worlds-heaviest-man-defeats-coronavirus/,Former ‘world’s heaviest man’ defeats coronavirus,"A Mexican who was once the world’s heaviest man has beaten the coronavirus, helped – he believes – by several years of dieting, exercise, and stomach-reduction surgery that saw him shed hundreds of kilos.
Juan Pedro Franco used to weigh 595 kilos (1,310 pounds) – more than the average male polar bear and enough to be certified by Guinness World Records in 2017.
The 36-year-old now weighs around 208 kilos, but his history of diabetes, high blood pressure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease made his battle against the virus particularly grueling.
“It’s a very aggressive disease. I had a headache, body ache, breathing difficulty, a fever. I was a very high-risk person,” Franco told AFP from his home in the central state of Aguascalientes.
Mexico, which has the world’s fourth-highest COVID-19 death toll, has the highest obesity rate on the planet among children and the second-highest among adults.
A quarter of the more than 74,000 Mexicans who have died after catching the virus were overweight.
Many of the dead suffered from at least one underlying condition such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, often associated with a poor diet and lack of exercise.
“Patients who are diabetic, have hypertension and heart disease are more susceptible to serious complications” from the virus, said Jose Antonio Castaneda, the doctor who headed the team that treated Franco’s obesity.
“Their chances of pulling through are very slim,” he added.
His patient, who was once too heavy to get out of bed, was an exception.
Franco, who lost his 66-year-old mother to COVID-19, believes that his weight loss treatment – including 3 operations – helped him to survive because his diabetes and hypertension are now under control.",Agence France-Presse,"Sep 24, 2020 9:18 AM PHT"
https://www.rappler.com/science/life-health/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-trial-late-stage-september-2020/,J&J COVID-19 vaccine trial moves into late stage,"Johnson & Johnson said Wednesday, September 23, it was entering the final Phase 3 stage of its COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial following positive results in earlier stages.
The trial will seek to enroll up to 60,000 volunteers across more than 200 sites in the US and around the world, the company and the US National Institutes for Health (NIH), which is providing funding, said.
With the move, J&J becomes the 10th maker globally to conduct a Phase 3 trial against COVID-19, and the 4th in the US.
The company, which is developing the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis through its subsidiary Janssen, said it anticipated the drug would be ready for emergency approval by early 2021 if proven safe and effective.
“As COVID-19 continues to impact the daily lives of people around the world, our goal remains the same – leveraging the global reach and scientific innovation of our company to help bring an end to this pandemic,” said Alex Gorsky, the company’s chairman and CEO.
Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, added: “Four COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in Phase 3 clinical testing in the United States just over 8 months after SARS-CoV-2 was identified.”
“This is an unprecedented feat for the scientific community made possible by decades of progress in vaccine technology and a coordinated, strategic approach across government, industry and academia.”
The US has given J&J about $1.45 billion in funding under Operation Warp Speed.
The vaccine is based on a single dose of a cold-causing adenovirus, modified so that it can no longer replicate, combined with a part of the new coronavirus called the spike protein that it uses to invade human cells.
J&J used the same technology in its Ebola vaccine which received marketing approval from the European Commission in July.
The company said it was poised to imminently publish the results from an earlier stage of the trial on a medical preprint site.
Pre-clinical testing on rhesus macaque monkeys that were published in the journal Nature showed it provided complete or near-complete protection against virus infection in the lungs and nose.
Like several other Phase 3 trials that are underway, its primary objective is to test whether the vaccine can prevent symptomatic COVID-19.",Agence France-Presse,"Sep 24, 2020 12:08 AM PHT"
