https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/gut-instinct-a-surprising-cause-of-intoxication-symptoms/,Gut Instinct: A Surprising Cause of Intoxication Symptoms,"A 24-year-old man presents to a family medicine clinic after being seen in the emergency department (ED) 5 days prior for acute altered mental status. While in the ED, it was noted that the patient had fallen before arrival, had an unstable gait, and had slurred speech. The patient did not recall any of these events at the time of the ED visit. Over the last 2 months, the patient had multiple episodes similar to this but not as severe. The patient reports that he consumes alcohol, typically 2 alcoholic drinks over the weekend, but has not consumed any alcohol in the preceding 5 days before arriving at the ED. He has not used illicit substances, tobacco, or marijuana and has no history of headaches, nausea, vomiting, vision loss, or unintended weight loss.
At the family medicine clinic, the patient’s blood pressure is 131/86 mm Hg. His temperature is 36.5°C, pulse rate is 84 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and pulse oxygenation on room air is 99%. The patient’s height is 180.3 cm, weight 92.2 kg, and BMI 28.3 kg/m2.
He does not appear to be in objective distress, and his head is normocephalic with no signs of trauma. His oropharynx is clear and moist. The eye examination reveals a clear sclera, no conjunctiva injection, and pupils equal and reactive to light bilaterally. The patient’s neck is supple with no masses; his heart has a normal rate and regular rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Pulmonary examination is appropriate, with no respiratory distress objectively appreciated, nor any rhonchi, rales, or abnormal lung sounds on auscultation.
The abdomen is soft to palpation with no distension or mass appreciated and no peritoneal sign of rigidity, guarding, or organomegaly. There are no deficits in focal motor strength in the bilateral upper and lower extremities, and no focal sensory deficits are appreciated in the upper and lower extremities bilaterally. There is no presence of asterixis.
His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)score is a 15.
The breakdown of his score is:
The patient’s initial evaluation in the ED included a complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), hepatic function panel, magnesium and ethanol tests, urine drug screen, computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head without intravenous contrast to evaluate for anemia, electrolyte derangement, or hypoglycemia all of which can manifest with altered mental status.
The laboratory diagnostic results from the ED visit revealed elevated results for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 309 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 112 U/L, and ethanol levels at 224 mg/dL (Table 1). The results of his CBC, BMP, and magnesium test were normal. His urine drug screen came back negative, and the CT scan of the head without intravenous contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormality.
Five days later, when the patient is seen in family medicine, he reports that since being in the ED he has not consumed alcohol. He reports that he is changing his dietary intake to a Mediterranean diet and reports no return of symptoms since the ED visit.
Table 1. Laboratory Diagnostic Results from the Emergency Department Visit
In the family medicine clinic, a repeat comprehensive metabolic panel and ethanol test are ordered, as well as further serological studies to assess the elevated hepatic function panel results seen in the ED. The clinic proceeds with hydrogen breath testing and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) with small-bowel aspirations, testing for bacterial and fungal growth to assess whether colonization is contributing to ethanol production.
Two days later the patient’s EGD results reveal normal structural anatomy, with fluid aspiration complete. Six weeks later, further evaluation of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures, as well as fungal cultures results, reveals no growth after incubation. The patient’s hydrogen breath testing shows no hydrogen or methane peak response during the study. His results from the metabolic panel are mostly normal except his ALT levels are still elevated at 65 U/L.
At this time, the patient is referred to gastroenterology for consultation and is seen 1 week later. The gastroenterologist recommends a 24-hour hospital admission for a controlled glucose challenge test. After the glucose bolus is consumed, subsequent serum ethanol levels are found to be elevated and increasing with 56 mg/dL at 30 minutes, 187 mg/dL at 60 minutes, and 362 mg/dL at 2 hours; testing is discontinued at this time. With the laboratory diagnostic results from the family medicine clinic (Table 2), the patient is subsequently diagnosed with auto-brewery syndrome (ABS) and starts treatment with 200 mg of fluconazole daily for 4 weeks.
Table 2. Laboratory Diagnostic Results From the Family Medicine Clinic
Treatment of ABS entails lifestyle modifications and potential pharmacotherapy. A sugar-restricted and low-carbohydrate diet is crucial for reducing the fermentable products that can lead to ethanol production.1 Pharmacologic agents for the treatment of ABS are primarily aimed at treating underlying fungal overgrowth. Oral treatment options such as fluconazole, itraconazole, or nystatin, can be prescribed if oral treatment fails, intravenous micafungin can be administered (Table 3).2
Table 3. Pharmacotherapy Treatment for ABS2
ABS, also known as gut fermentation syndrome, is a rare medical condition characterized by endogenous ethanol production within the gastrointestinal system.3 This internal ethanol production is largely believed to be due to the presence of yeast housed within the gut, particularly Candida species.3 After ingesting carbohydrates, the yeast converts the sugars into ethanol, leading to clinical symptomatology (Figure). Risk factors for ABS may include intestinal dysbiosis because of an imbalance in the gut microbiota, a high- carbohydrate diet, diabetes mellitus, or antibiotic usage disrupting the normal gut flora. Underlying gastrointestinal conditions such as Crohn disease, short bowel syndrome, and chronic bowel obstruction or hypomotility can predispose individuals to ABS by altering gut motility and microbiota composition.3
ABS can have a significant impact on the affected patient’s life. The individual may suffer from symptoms associated with intoxication such as vomiting, dizziness, disorientation, loss of coordination, chronic fatigue syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome.4 The symptoms also can lead to health concerns such as anxiety, poor productivity, or depression.4 ABS may have a significant impact on driving under the influence, personal relationships, and employment.4 There have been several case reports in which patients with ABS have had to be acquitted of driving under the influence charges because of the impact of the disease on blood alcohol concentration (BAC) readings.5
After the completion of fluconazole therapy, the patient meets with the GI department nutritionist, who starts slowly reintroducing carbohydrates into his diet. He reports no return of symptoms nor any increase in his BAC levels on home testing. The nutritionist recommends continued use of daily probiotics.
1. Elevated ethanol levels following a 24-hour observation with a glucose challenge of 200 g of glucose, blood alcohol testing, and breath alcohol testing can confirm ABS
2. A sugar-restricted and low-carbohydrate diet is crucial for reducing the fermentable products that can lead to ethanol production. Otherwise, treatment aimed at the fungi can be prescribed.
3. ABS can have a heavy impact on a patient’s health, relationships, and interactions with the law because of how it emulates intoxication and increases BAC readings.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/emtala-law-suit/,EMTALA: Patient Claimed Other Patients Were Getting Better Treatment in ED,"A 66-year-old woman, Mrs R, was brought into the emergency department (ED) by ambulance at 5:30 AM. The night before, a hurricane had passed through the area, creating devastation and a large-scale power outage. When Mrs R woke up in the dark, she lost her balance and tripped over a piece of furniture, landing hard on her left foot.
When she arrived at the hospital, the emergency medical technicians (EMTs) spoke to Nurse M, who was doing triage, and explained that Mrs R’s chief complaint was left foot trauma. Mrs R seemed irritated that Nurse M was talking to the EMTs rather than to her and interjected “I tripped getting out of bed.”
Nurse M noted that the patient was “stable, calm, expressive, alert, and oriented” and she categorized the patient as “urgent.”
At 6 AM, Mrs. R was evaluated by the ED physician, Dr P. He took her medical history and performed a physical examination. Dr P noted Mrs R’s chief complaint was that she had fallen and twisted her left foot. Mrs R was “active, alert, oriented, and in no distress,” and her heart had a regular rhythm, her lungs were clear, her abdomen was not distended or tender, and her extremities had no deformation and were neurovascularly intact. The patient had no neurologic deficits, the doctor noted.
He documented his diagnostic impression as left foot trauma and ordered pain medication and radiographs of the foot, tibia, and fibula.
The nursing staff provided pain medication at 6:30 AM. Mrs R was kept under observation as she awaited imaging, and at 7:45 AM, Nurse M documented that the patient was alert and oriented. She complained to the nursing staff about the delay in the radiography, but she was told that the ED was very busy.
Later that morning, Mrs. R was taken to radiology where radiographic images were taken. She was returned to the ED to wait.
At approximately 4 PM, the radiologist signed off on a report indicating that Mrs R had sustained a fracture. An hour and a half later, Dr P ordered anti-inflammatory and pain medications as well as additional ankle imaging. At 6 PM, the results of the additional radiographs came back, and Mrs. R’s foot was placed in a cast.
Mrs R was discharged around 8 PM. Nurse M noted in the patient’s chart that she had responded to the pain medication and was stable and accompanied by family. Mrs R was provided with written instructions upon discharge and was instructed to visit her physician within 3 days, to return to the ED if her symptoms worsened, to pick up her radiographic results and imaging studies to take to the physician, and to follow the instructions of her prescribed medication. She also was referred to 2 different orthopedists and instructed to get an appointment with one of them for follow-up immediately.
Mrs R did not see an orthopedist for more than a week. When she saw the orthopedist, he recommended surgery. Mrs R underwent a surgical procedure a week later; she had a positive outcome.
However, Mrs R was angry at her treatment in the hospital. She had spent many hours in the ED, and during that time she saw other patients come and go, while she waited. She saw patients sent to radiology who seemed to get their results faster than she did.
Mrs R initiated an action against the hospital for alleged violations of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). She asserted that the hospital did not provide proper medical care because of inadequate screening of her injury and failure to stabilize her condition at the hospital.
The hospital filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that it had met the requirements of EMTALA. Mrs R responded that the “egregious 10-hour delay in obtaining x-ray results” made her point, and that “no reasonable standard of care could justify such a prolonged wait for crucial diagnostic information.” She claimed that not only did the delay violate EMTALA screening requirements but also “potentially exacerbated” her condition.
The court first noted that EMTALA was initially enacted in response to claims that hospital EDs were refusing to accept or treat patients who had no medical insurance.
EMTALA imposes 2 obligations on covered EDs:
For a plaintiff to establish a violation of EMTALA they must show that they sought treatment at an ED covered by EMTALA and that the hospital either: (1) did not provide an appropriate screening or (2) released the patient without first stabilizing the emergency medical condition.
In this case, Mrs R could not prove that the hospital failed to screen or stabilize her condition. The court noted that delayed medical care, or even improper medical care, is not actionable under EMTALA. EMTALA only requires an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital’s ED.
Mrs R’s case occurred during a natural disaster when the hospital’s ED was very busy. As we have seen with the recent wildfires in Los Angeles, disasters are not uncommon and EDs can become overwhelmed with patients seeking care. Remember that EMTALA only requires screening and stabilization, not treatment within a specified time or in a particular manner.
The nursing staff’s copious notes in this case, documenting the patient’s pain and affect, were also helpful tools to fight this lawsuit.","Ann W. Latner, JD"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/joyce-nichols-a-pioneer-in-the-physician-assistant-profession/,Joyce Nichols: A Pioneer in the Physician Assistant Profession,"Joyce Nichols made history as the first woman—and the first Black woman—to become a physician assistant (PA), paving the way for other women in the emerging profession. Her journey is one of perseverance, advocacy, and resilience. This article honors her legacy and reflects on the importance of diversity and inclusion in health care.
In 1965, Joyce Nichols received a scholarship to study as a licensed practical nurse (LPN). After graduating, she worked in the cardiac care unit at Duke University Medical Center. This was where she first learned about the newly established Duke University PA program.1
The Duke University PA Program, founded in 1965, was the birthplace of the PA profession. Initially, the program was attended exclusively by men and was intended to train former military medical staff. Despite societal barriers that may have discouraged her from applying, Nichols found encouragement from Eugene Stead, Jr, MD, the program’s founder.1,2
After she received multiple rejections from the program, she spoke with the admission staff, asking if they were receiving federal funding for this program. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited employment discrimination in federally funded programs.3 When they confirmed it did, Nichols said in an interview in 2006: “Well, you know they say you can’t discriminate against gender. You can’t keep females out. We can have a press conference and discuss this.”4
Her persistence paid off, she was accepted into the program’s third class and graduated in 1970.4
“She was a very determined person,” Nichols’ husband, McArthur, stated in a 2012 interview, “Once she had her mind set on anything, she was not to be denied.”5
However, Nichols experienced challenges early on as a student. She discovered that, unlike the other PA students, she had not been awarded a stipend from the program. After inquiring with program staff, she eventually received the stipend, but the compensation was insufficient to support her family. As a result, she enrolled in the Twenty/Twenty program, which allowed PA students to work 20 hours a week while receiving pay for a full 40-hour work week as long as they remained enrolled.4
While Joyce Nichols pursued a career as a PA to build upon her nursing knowledge and skills, she also saw it as a chance to break down gender norms in health care. “Females could do just as well as anybody else, and I could learn as well as my classmates,” she stated. As the first woman in the program, she felt immense pressure to succeed, not just for herself but to show that other women could excel in this profession.4
Upon graduation, Nichols was determined to use her skills to support underserved populations. This passion for community-based care was deeply personal, as she recalled how difficult it was to get her grandmother to seek health care in rural North Carolina.Nichols emphasized the importance of uplifting marginalized communities stating, “It’s a need. I’ve been there. I know what it’s like, and I don’t want to see anybody else there, and if you are, give them a hand up. That’s all I can say about that. And it’s my only reason because there’s no money in it.”4
Her vision to expand health care accessibility came to life with support from E Harvey Estes, Jr, MD, the former chair of Duke’s Department of Community Health Sciences. When Estes inquired about Nichols’ plans upon graduation, she responded, “I’d like to see a rural health clinic.”1,4 He responded, “Give me the goals and objectives, and we’ll see about that.” By February 1970, he secured funding for the clinic and Nichols worked to get the program running.4
“I got the clinic started, and it was the first rural health clinic in North Carolina,” she stated. “We had the rural health clinic and the urban clinic. It got some good reviews from what we were doing. The residents were very pleased with it.”4
Although funding for the clinic ended by 1972, Nichols and Estes worked to transition the staff to the Lincoln Community Health Center, where she continued working for 23 years.
By the time Joyce Nichols retired in 1995, she was managing the Diabetes and Hypertension clinic and providing health care to a homeless shelter in Durham.2
Nichols played an integral role in shaping the PA profession. She was a charter member of the American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA) and was the first person of color on the Board of Directors, where she founded and led the AAPA Minority Affairs Committee. She also helped establish the North Carolina Academy of Physician Assistants, where she served as treasurer and was on the Board of Directors of the Durham County Hospital Corporation.2
Beyond her leadership roles, Nichols was a devoted mentor. She helped guide incoming PA students as a preceptor and was an adjunct faculty member of Duke’s Department of Community and Family Medicine. Her impact on the PA profession was widely recognized and she received countless honors including
“Being a PA has been a rewarding experience for me because I was able to do a lot of things that a lot of people didn’t do,” Nichols stated. “I think I had the best of  2 worlds, because I had the clinical as well as the academic part of it, so I was able to keep up, teach, and it just allowed me to do a lot of different things. It was great.”4
Nichols’ advocacy extended beyond health care, as she served as a commissioner to the Durham Housing Authority, helping tenants navigate legal cases. For her commitment to social justice, she has been awarded the prestigious Nancy Susan Reynolds Award for Advocacy and named the AAPA Paragon “Humanitarian of the Year” in 1996. She was also inducted into the Duke University PA Alumni Hall of Fame for her advocacy work.1,2
In 2012, Joyce Nichols passed away at the age of 72. To honor her legacy, the PA Foundation created the Joyce Nichols Memorial Scholarship in July 2020, a $1000 scholarship awarded to  Black PA students annually. The 2024 recipients included Nkiruka Anudokem, Touro University California; Gifty Addison, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science; Chloe Deavens, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; Mallory Pitchford,  Meharry Medical College; and Maurice Paylor II, Meharry Medical College.
In 2023, the Durham Housing Authority and Laurel Street Residential opened an affordable senior housing complex named “The Joyce” in her honor.1,2
While Joyce Nichols paved the way for greater diversity in the PA profession, Black PA students remain significantly underrepresented. Approximately 3.25% of PA students identify as Black or African American, while Black people constitute approximately 14.4% of the US population.6,7 This disparity highlights ongoing systemic barriers, including a lack of representation and access to educational opportunities.
In her 2006 interview, Nichols looked back on her experience and shared how Black people were not permitted to eat in the cafeteria and were confined to the basement of the hospital. Regarding the progress of inclusion in the PA profession, she stated, “It has come a long way, but it still has a long way to go, but I think they’ll get there…You have to be willing to work at it, and you have to be willing to prepare for what it is that you want to do.”4
Nichols’ legacy serves as a reminder that although strides have been made toward inclusion, there is more that can be done to increase representation in the profession. Her story serves as a reminder to current and future health care professionals to not only celebrate progress but to actively work to dismantle systemic barriers to inclusion.","Allison Nguyen, PharmD"

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/treating-alcohol-use-disorder-glp-1s-emerge-as-a-promising-new-therapy/,Treating Alcohol Use Disorder: GLP-1s Emerge as a Promising New Therapy,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a multifaceted disease that causes more than 140,000 deaths annually.1 AUD, if untreated, is a constantly relapsing condition associated with severe health complications and may interfere with an individual’s daily responsibilities and relationships.2 Despite 29.5 million Americans aged 12 years and older being diagnosed with AUD, only 7.6% of individuals will be treated in their lifetime, ranking it as 1 of the top 5 preventable causes of death in the United States.1,3 These findings emphasize the urgent need for more research into effective treatment options to address AUD.
Alcohol influences nearly every neurochemical pathway in the brain, eventually causing chronic users to develop a neuronal dependence on the substance.1 The mesolimbic system is the reward network of the brain and is critical in the development of alcohol’s desirable and addictive qualities.4 The ventral tegmental area (VTA) contains the mesolimbic system, which then connects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the primary region of the brain’s positive reinforcement circuitry. Multiple hormones act on these areas to impact an individual’s behavioral and emotional responses to stimuli. When a person is exposed to a reward-related stimulus such as alcohol, the VTA releases dopamine, which travels via the mesolimbic system to activate the NAc.4
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone that regulates the reward response in this complex pathway. GLP-1 hormones interact with receptors in multiple brain regions to induce various physiological responses affecting an individual’s reward regulation. The hormone is synthesized in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the hindbrain, and it regulates the release of several neurotransmitters associated with rewards, such as dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and serotonin.5
Chronic alcohol exposure activates multiple neurochemical pathways that accumulate to a euphoric feeling and contribute to the vicious cycle of dependence and abuse.
Genetics
Various factors contribute to an individual’s risk of developing AUD, with genetics comprising 40% to 60% of this risk.6 Researchers have pinpointed a region on chromosome 4p linked that contains genes for the risk for alcohol dependence and affecting brain oscillations in the beta frequency range (13-28 Hz). This region includes 4 GABAA receptor genes—GABRG1, GABRA2, GABRA4, and GABRB1—involved in alcohol’s effects and beta frequency modulation. The strongest association with alcohol dependence was found in a section of GABRA2 (alpha-2 subunit) where 43 consecutive 3-SNP haplotypes reached statistically exceptional significance (P = .000000022). The association of GABRA2 with both alcohol dependence and beta EEG frequencies highlights its potential role in influencing dependence by affecting neural excitation levels.7 A variety of alleles that encode for serotonin receptors may affect mood regulation and contribute to alcohol dependence, as well as alleles determining dopamine receptors and transporters, which can influence the rewarding effects of alcohol.8,9
Environmental
Although genetic factors are significant, environmental, social, and psychological components also can be influential in the development of AUD.  Several factors over a person’s lifetime may affect an individual’s susceptibility to the development of AUD and can influence the level of severity of the disorder. Early onset of alcohol consumption, family history of substance abuse, trauma, and low socioeconomic status increase the risk for AUD development.8 Stress and pain are significant motivators for alcohol consumption, and individuals experiencing social anxiety are notably more vulnerable.8 Sex disparities are reflected in AUD prevalence with 7% of men and 4% of women affected.10 Environmental influences include cultural acceptance of heavy drinking, positive expectations of alcohol’s social benefits, and limited parental oversight. Lack of family and social support, mood and conduct disorders, and poor self-control further increase susceptibility.11
Both behavioral and physical symptoms are notable in AUD. Patients frequently consume large amounts of alcohol because of intense cravings and can develop a high tolerance, requiring more alcohol to become intoxicated. AUD can cause an individual to neglect work, school, or home responsibilities, and result in social and interpersonal problems.2 Chronic alcohol consumption also negatively affects various organ systems, particularly the liver and pancreas, leading to jaundice, ascites, and potentially pancreatitis.3 However, AUD is not only limited to gastrointestinal complications and may contribute to a variety of other adverse outcomes and affect other organ systems (Table 1).3
Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal are a defining characteristic of AUD, typically peaking at around 72 hours after reducing or stopping prolonged, heavy alcohol consumption. A patient may experience insomnia, agitation, tachycardia, seizures, hypertension, and diaphoresis. Some patients may present with hallucinations and altered mental status.12 The most severe manifestations requiring medical attention include delirium tremens, hallucinations, and seizures.13 These intense and uncomfortable symptoms often drive individuals to continue drinking to avoid or alleviate them.2
Screening should be conducted in patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of AUD. Although there are multiple screening methods, the AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption), Single Alcohol Screening Question (SASQ), and CAGE questionnaire are the 3 most commonly used tools.14 The AUDIT-C, created by the World Health Organization (WHO), is generally regarded as the primary tool for screening AUD. This 10-question tool assesses the frequency and amount of alcohol an individual consumes and provides high diagnostic accuracy for screening at-risk individuals across various settings.15
If patients screen positive for AUD, they should undergo evaluation using DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) criteria (Table 2). Diagnosis requires meeting at least 2 out of 11 criteria within a 12-month period.2
Table 2. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria of Alcohol Use Disorder2
Currently approved pharmacologic treatments for AUD are designed to create aversive reactions to alcohol, reducing its positive reinforcement and emotional effects.16 Although researchers are still investigating the potential utilization of drugs like antidepressants and antipsychotics, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently recognizes only 3 medications for the treatment of AUD: acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone (Table 3). 16
These drugs work primarily by affecting different pathways in alcohol metabolism. Disulfiram irreversibly inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzymes responsible for converting alcohol into acetaldehyde; naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist, reducing relapse rates by blocking opioid receptors; and although still not fully understood, acamprosate is suspected to function as an agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), a type of glutamate receptor. A systematic review of 24 randomized controlled trials (n=6915) found that acamprosate significantly reduced the risk of any drinking (relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.91; number needed to treat, 9.09) and increased cumulative abstinence duration by an average of 10.94 days (95% CI, 5.08-16.81 days) compared with placebo.17
Table 3. FDA-Approved Pharmacologic Treatments for AUD
GLP-1 agonists have become increasingly popular medications, initially approved for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and, more recently, recognized for their efficacy in managing obesity. Many types of GLP-1 agonists are available with varying structures, dosing regimens, and administration methods. Examples of GLP-1 agonists include dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide.18
These medications work in T2DM and obesity by acting as incretin hormone mimetics, boosting the effects of the hormone in the gastrointestinal tract. They lower blood sugar levels without significantly increasing the risk for hypoglycemia, suppress glucagon secretion, delay gastric emptying, induce feelings of satiety, and offer other therapeutic benefits.19
As noted, in addition to playing a key in the pancreas and stomach, GLP-1 agonists are also present in the brain.20 These drugs act on the reward center in the brain, specifically those associated with food reward-seeking behaviors, which has prompted research into GLP-1 agonists as a potential treatment option for other disease states related to reward-seeking behaviors such as addiction and AUD.21
Most research on GLP-1 agonists as a potential therapy for AUD focuses on the capacity of the agents to modulate reward and pleasure-seeking mechanisms, much like they do in regulating food intake. GLP-1 receptors are expressed in the mesolimbic region, which relays dopaminergic signals. GLP-1 agents modulate the pathways involving the NAc, an area associated with motivation, and the VTA, an area linked with reward, by reducing dopamine release and activating these areas. They also act in the amygdala to affect emotional and motivational behaviors and in the lateral hypothalamus, which coordinates communication to peripheral organs that affect reward signaling.5
Although more research is needed, preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that GLP-1 agonists work in these areas to regulate alcohol-mediated behaviors, neurochemistry, and motivation.20 Both animal and human research demonstrate that the administration of GLP-1s decreases an individual’s preference for alcohol and the amount consumed.22 Moreover, because of the chronicity and frequent recurrence of AUD, pharmacologic treatments must interrupt the cycle of use, abstinence, and recurrence. The growing demand for GLP-1 agents for managing T2DM and obesity has led to increased demand, reducing availability and rising costs.22
Behavioral interventions frequently complement pharmacologic treatment to enhance compliance and efficacy. Research demonstrates that combining pharmacologic treatment with therapy yields superior outcomes compared with either approach in isolation.16 A variety of psychological treatments are available for individuals, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, guided self-control training, and motivational enhancement therapy. Mutual support groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, have demonstrated effective support through encouragement, accountability, and an expanded social network, particularly for those participating in alcohol abstinence or attempting to reduce their drinking.23 Multiple empirical studies also indicate that behavioral and psychological interventions may be equally effective as medication in treating AUD.23

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/dr-uche-blackstock-speaks-on-racism-in-medicine/,Dr Uché Blackstock Speaks on Racism in Medicine,"Uché Blackstock, MD, was covered head to toe in personal protective equipment (PPE) when she entered her patient’s exam room in New York City at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her patient, a Black woman experiencing shortness of breath, tried to get a better look at her physician, but could not get a good view through the layers of PPE.
“Are you Black?” The patient asked Dr Blackstock.
Dr Blackstock took a moment to process the question. She never thought any of her patients would have to ask about her race; she assumed it would always be immediately evident upon meeting her patients. But this was one of several extraordinary situations that she would learn to navigate while practicing emergency medicine at the epicenter of a major COVID-19 outbreak.
“Yes, I am,” she replied to her patient.
The patient let out a thankful sigh of relief. “I just want to make sure I’m being listened to,” she said.
Dr Blackstock understood her patient’s feelings. As a Black woman in medicine, she has first-hand experience with structural racism’s effects on health care institutions. She recently wrote The New York Times Best Seller LEGACY: A Black Physician Reckons with Racism in Medicine to share her story; she and her twin sister, Oni, were the first Black mother-daughter legacies to graduate from Harvard Medical School.
Dr Blackstock spoke about her book, her career, and her advice for early career Black health care professionals at the DNPs of Color annual conference, held in Philadelphia, PA, October 17-20, 2024.
Dr Uché Blackstock calls her mother, Dr Dale Gloria Blackstock, “the original Dr Blackstock.” Her mother graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1976. When she and her husband bought their house in central Brooklyn in 1977, redlining prohibited them from purchasing homeowner’s insurance.
Dr Dale Gloria Blackstock was a pioneer in applying racial justice to medicine. When reviewing her mother’s writing and contributions to her community, Dr Blackstock noted how many of the observations her mother made are still relevant today.
“She was doing work in the 80s and 90s with other Black health care professionals in our community to organize community health fairs, making sure that residents had wrap-around services, during a time when people weren’t even talking about health equity per se,” Dr Blackstock said.
Dr Blackstock was 19 years old when her mother died at age 47. During her talk at the DNPs of Color Conference, Dr Blackstock reflected on what it meant to be approaching her 47th birthday.
“When I was 19, I thought of my mother as my mother,” she said. “But now as a 46-year-old, almost 47-year-old, with all of the roles that I hold including that of mother, of health professional, of the founder of my own consulting firm, as now author, I recognize all the complexity of who my mother was and I appreciate her, and I didn’t know this was possible, even more now than I did when she was alive.”
Dr Blackstock’s family is 1 of 2 mother-daughter legacy pairings at Harvard Medical School to date. Dr Blackstock noted that by 2024, she hoped there would be more Black mother-daughter legacies at her alma mater, and change is overdue.
Through her work finding solutions to address unconscious bias and structural racism, Dr Blackstock hopes to make clearer paths for future generations of children of color to enter medicine.
“What I didn’t realize when I was 19 that I realize now looking back is that I always thought of my mother as exceptional, and she was exceptional,” Dr Blackstock said. “But there are so many other young exceptional children from the neighborhood that she grew up in central Brooklyn who could have been at Harvard Medical School who weren’t because of poverty and because of racism.”
As an adult, Dr Blackstock realized how redlining and other systemic factors influence the health of her community in central Brooklyn to this day. For example, rates of diseases including asthma and obesity tend to be higher in communities that were redlined.
“I think about how appalled my mother would be if she were still here physically with us,” Dr Blackstock said. “I wanted to use this book to talk about her journey, my journey from child to medical student to practicing physician, and also a lot of the elements of me having to unlearn what I had learned, what had been a part of my formal education and training that wasn’t until I was in residency or wasn’t until I was a practicing physician that I made this realization that a lot of the disease and illness that we see in our patients is not about individual choices that our patients are making; it’s not about anything being inherently wrong with Black people and Black bodies, but something being inherently wrong with the systems that operate in our country.”
During her time on the front lines caring for COVID-19 patients, Dr Blackstock observed her patients “getting browner and browner by the day.” She noticed that people of color were contracting COVID-19 at a higher rate than White patients; often, patients of color had worse outcomes, too.
The COVID-19 pandemic spurred much conversation about trust in medical institutions and access to healthcare, especially in communities with large minority populations. Dr Blackstock explained that there is significant work needed on behalf of health institutions to build trust in these communities.
“We talk about medical trust on behalf of patients, but it’s really institutional untrustworthiness,” she said. “How are institutions showing that they are fully invested in the communities that they serve? How are they involving community members on boards? Are they using a community governance model? There is a lot within the system that for us is not rocket science, but for them, there is a lack of organizational will to change.”
In the neighborhood where Dr Blackstock grew up, there was neither a grocery store nor a park within walking distance. It is factors like these, she explained, that show how health is not simply just about access to health care.
During conversations about addressing structural racism in health care, discussions about providing racially concordant care can drown out conversations about community health. Dr Blackstock noted that all health professionals should be able to care for all of their patients regardless of whether or not they look alike, but this is only one piece of the puzzle.
“When you’re in the room with the patient, it’s not just you and your patient. It’s their family. It’s their employer. It’s their neighbors. It’s everybody. And that’s not something I learned in medical school,” she said.
During her time working in academic medicine, Dr Blackstock found herself in a position where she was no longer aligned with the values of the institution where she worked.
At first, Dr Blackstock was excited to take on a role that allowed her to conduct research, mentor students, and be a leader in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Soon, however, she noticed red flags. She was the only Black faculty member in her department. She felt undervalued and underappreciated when she discovered that the DEI position was a figurehead role. In addition, she was denied a promotion despite having all of the necessary qualifications.
“I felt suffocated by having to make myself small,” she said. “Leaving was a life-saving decision for me.”
Although Dr Blackstock felt some mixed emotions about leaving — particularly because she wondered how her mentees would be affected by her departure — she knew she had to leave after feeling “muzzled and silenced” by her employer.
To the attendees at the DNPs of Color meeting, she encouraged the audience to consider the values and culture of their institution when deciding if it is time to stay or go. Most importantly, she stated, no one should feel like a martyr in academic medicine. “We need to ask ourselves ‘Am I in alignment with the organization, with the institution, with the culture that I’m working in?’” She said. “We have to remove ourselves from this perspective that we are lucky to be there. They are lucky to have us.”
As a physician who wishes that she had been more intentional in seeking out mentors early in her career, Dr Blackstock encouraged young professionals in the audience to find mentors who can share pearls and guidance.
Meetings like the DNPs of Color annual conference are opportune times for networking, she noted. “You are never alone. I want you to make use of this opportunity to form bonds that you need to form,” she said.
After sharing her own story as the first Black mother-daughter legacy at Harvard Medical School, Dr Blackstock left her audience with a thoughtful question to ponder: what is your legacy going to be?",Michelle Falci
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/will-trump-admins-elimination-of-dei-programs-impact-cancer-research/,Will Trump Admin’s Elimination of DEI Programs Impact Cancer Research?,"Federal agencies have removed web pages dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs related to cancer research and other clinical research, raising concerns that the Trump administration is trying to curb diversity in clinical trials.1-5
It is unclear whether the removal of these pages is permanent or if these programs will cease to exist, but the actions come in the wake of executive orders that eliminated federal DEI initiatives.6
The removal of the pages has raised concerns among researchers and health care providers, who argue that diversity in clinical trials is not a political issue; it’s a health issue.
“Too often in the past, clinical trials were restricted to patients who did not completely represent the usual patient with the disease being studied,” said Alan Lyss, MD, sub-principal investigator (emeritus) at the Heartland Cancer Research NCORP in St Louis, Missouri. “The effort to make clinical trials more diverse did not stem from a desire to correct prior injustice, but rather from a need to make treatment results in practice more accurate for patients and their health care providers.”
“Because the efforts of the past few years toward greater inclusivity reflected scientific principles, rather than social or political pressure, and because they reflected what patients and physicians were actually seeing in community practice, the rationale for broadening participation in clinical trials resonated and should continue,” Dr Lyss added.
One of the web pages that was recently removed is the landing page for the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) OCE Equity Program, an initiative focused on making oncology clinical trials accessible to a broader patient population.1,3The goal of the OCE Equity Program — which expanded upon its predecessor, Project Equity — was to improve access to cancer trials “for populations that have been historically underrepresented in clinical research, such as racial and ethnic minorities, individuals who live in rural areas, sexual and gender minorities, and individuals with economic, linguistic, or cultural barriers to health care services.”3,7“Historically, underrepresentation of minority groups in clinical trials has contributed to health disparities, not only for racial/ethnic groups but also rural and older populations,” said Estelamari Rodriguez, MD, a thoracic oncologist at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at University of Miami Health System in Florida.
“Policies that curtail DEI efforts in ensuring clinical trial diversity suggest that this is no longer a problem we need to solve,” Dr Rodriguez continued. “Diversity in clinical trials is not only an ethical imperative; it is also good science. It allows us to understand how treatments affect different populations and how we can solve these differences. It also ensures equitable access to the benefits of scientific advancements and health care solutions that serve the needs of the entire population.”
The FDA is not the only agency removing web pages. A page dedicated to the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Equity and Inclusion Program has been taken down as well. The program was created to “increase the diversity of the cancer research workforce, build a more inclusive and equitable NCI community, address cancer disparities, and advance health equity.”4,5
An NCI webinar called “Sexual and Gender Minority Cancer Research Methodology: Lessons from the Field” has been taken down as well.8 The webinar featured several NCI Behavioral Research Program grantees who presented their findings on health equity disparities for sexual and gender minority cancer survivors.
Additionally, the landing page for the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) Sexual & Gender Minority Research Office (SGMRO) has been removed.2,9 The SGMRO coordinated sexual and gender minority-related health research and activities “by working directly with the NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices.”
Other pages across the NIH website — including pages dedicated to the UNITE initiative — have been taken down as well.10 The goal of UNITE was to identify and address “any structural racism that may exist within the NIH and throughout the biomedical and behavioral workforce.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/assisted-reproductive-technology-in-epilepsy/,Assisted Reproductive Technology in Epilepsy: Experts Weigh In,"Approximately 1.5 million US women with epilepsy are in the reproductive age range (15-49 years), with involvement of certain factors — endogenous and exogenous hormones, antiseizure medications (ASMs), seizures — making the management of epilepsy more complex and challenging among this population.1
Fertility treatments, including assisted reproductive technology (ART), are often considered for patients with epilepsy. While recent studies support the efficacy of ART among women with epilepsy, there are limited data on the relationship between epilepsy, ART, and infertility.2
Endocrinology Advisor and Neurology Advisor spoke with experts in their fields to understand the mechanisms behind the association between ART and epilepsy, the latest research updates in the area, the management and standard of care for this patient population, and the importance of collaboration between specialties for desirable outcomes.
Lisa M. Bateman, MD, FRCPC, is a professor of neurology and the director of the Surgical Epilepsy Program at Cedars-Sinai, Los Angeles, California. Jeffrey M. Chung, MD, FAAN, FAES, is the director of the Epilepsy Program and the Clinical Neurophysiology Program at Cedars-Sinai Department of Neurology. Maria P. Velez, MD, PhD, FRCSC, is an associate professor at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.
While recent research has shown that ART is effective among women with epilepsy, sex hormones may have a potential impact on seizure control and interact with ASMs.1,3
a) How are sex hormones and epilepsy linked?
LB: There are complex relationships between sex hormones and epilepsy, the occurrence of seizures, and ASMs, both outside of and during a pregnancy.2
MV: Sex hormones and epilepsy are reciprocally related. It is common for patients with epilepsy to experience reproductive system disorders, and fluctuations in sex hormones during the reproductive cycle can result in exacerbation of epilepsy.4
JC: A reduction in progesterone or its secretion is linked to an increase in seizures in some patients during the perimenstrual and luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, respectively (called catamenial epilepsy), whereas preovulatory surge in estrogen is suspected to play a part in increase of breakthrough seizures. Furthermore, some ASMs that are hepatic enzyme inducers often increase the metabolism of oral contraceptives and decrease their effectiveness at typical dosages. However, the ASM lamotrigine has been shown to metabolize faster when estrogen/estradiol is introduced into the body.5
For patients already receiving treatment with lamotrigine, adding any estrogen/estradiol will increase the breakdown of lamotrigine, lower its serum concentration, and be less effective. As pregnancy progresses, endogenous estrogen increases, which results in lowering of lamotrigine serum level. Hence, it is imperative for pregnant patients receiving lamotrigine to be under close monitoring for lamotrigine levels, with appropriate dose adjustment to prevent breakthrough seizures.
b) What is the impact of ART on seizures in epilepsy?
MV: There is a lack of information about the impact of ART on seizure frequency or ASM levels. Estrogens, particularly estradiol, appear to have a proconvulsant effect. During ART treatment, the medications used for ovarian stimulation increase the levels of estrogens, which, in theory, can influence seizure frequency. Furthermore, the concentrations of certain ASMs could decrease during ART treatment.6 However, further research is needed, as only small case reports have been published.
JC: ART utilizes hormonal injections for egg harvesting and embryo implantation preparation. Thus, close monitoring of the patient’s ASM serum level, especially with lamotrigine, and dosage adjustment are very important to avoid breakthrough seizures.
c) What is the medication management protocol and how can seizures be controlled in patients undergoing ART?
LB: A neurologist’s management of persons with epilepsy (PWE) during pregnancy is focused on minimizing risks to both the pregnant individual and the developing fetus, with the prevention of seizures, particularly generalized tonic clonic seizures.7 Hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy can influence seizure control,4 but other factors, including ASM changes, sleep disturbances, and morning sickness, may also play a role. Ideally, the lowest doses of ASMs needed to control seizures are used during pregnancy, but some individuals may require higher ASM doses or multiple ASMs to treat their seizures.
Several ASMs (eg, lamotrigine) can be impacted by changes in hormones and other metabolic processes that occur during a pregnancy.8 A neurologist should, therefore, regularly assess patients throughout any pregnancy for the occurrence of seizures or changes in seizure pattern, and regularly monitor the serum ASM levels, adjusting doses as necessary. However, there is no standard template for doing this, as circumstances and pregnancies vary by the individual. Similarly, ASM doses may need to be adjusted in the postpartum period to avoid symptoms of clinical toxicity as the metabolic changes of pregnancy resolve.8 An individualized approach to care is, therefore, key for the management of pregnancy in PWE.
d) How are ART protocols tailored for individual cases?
LB: ART for PWE can be complicated, one of the reasons being the variable and multistaged techniques that may be used. The choice of a specific ART protocol for any given individual would be made by reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialists. However, collaboration and communication before planning a pregnancy in which ART may be used, along with close monitoring of PWE and their ASM therapies throughout the course of ART, pregnancy, and postpartum remain the cornerstones of care.
MV: There is lack of literature about specific ART protocols for patients with epilepsy. Physiologically, patients whose epilepsy is exacerbated by changes in sex hormones during the menstrual cycle could benefit from ART protocols that result in lower levels of estrogens.4 However, more research is needed in this regard.
Neuro-obstetrics is an emerging subspeciality in medicine, with the management
of pregnancy, by way of ART, being a collaborative effort between OB-GYNs, neurologists, and reproductive endocrinologists.9
a) What is the role of each specialty in providing adequate care to this unique
population and optimizing outcomes?
JC: It is a collaborative effort, but close monitoring and timely dosage adjustment are key from the neurology/epilepsy standpoint. As for genetic testing and counselling, additional testing may be appropriate depending on the type of epilepsy.
MV: The approach to patients with epilepsy who need ART should be multidisciplinary, including neurologists and maternal fetal medicine (MFM) specialists. Usually, patients with epilepsy are referred to reproductive endocrinologists by their neurologists, who will then consult with the MFM team. The neurologist can advise if the epilepsy is well-controlled to consider a pregnancy, what ASMs are appropriate for patients trying to conceive, and type and dose adjustment, if needed. The reproductive endocrinologist closely monitors patients with epilepsy during their ART cycle. The MFM team evaluates patients before conception and once pregnancy is achieved, the team follows the pregnancy and provides necessary antenatal care to decrease maternal or neonatal complications.
LB: The best management of any pregnancy in PWE must consider the heightened risks to both the pregnant patient and the developing fetus, and relies on collaboration and communication between the patient, treating neurologist, obstetrics specialist, and any other provider who may be involved in the patient’s care. Ideally, conversations about pregnancy planning and management for PWE should take place before a patient becomes pregnant.
b) What are the main concerns when women with epilepsy undergo ART?
When are referrals to other specialties considered; what is the general referral rate? How are patient concerns typically addressed?
MV: The main concern is the exacerbation of epilepsy during the ART cycle and
pregnancy. At our university hospital, I typically refer 100% of my patients to the MFM team before considering an ART cycle. The initial assessment is to counsel the patient (and partner, if that’s the case) about the implications of epilepsy during pregnancy, including potential complications, and to review the antiepileptic medications. After this visit, if there are no concerns from the MFM team, we will proceed with the ART cycle. We encourage patients to discuss with their neurologist and the MFM team about the implications of epilepsy during pregnancy. As a reproductive endocrinologist, I tend to discuss the potential effects of the ART cycle on their epilepsy, in addition to standard counselling that we provide to all patients undergoing ART.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/target-bp-initiative/,The Target BP Initiative: Aiming to Improve Hypertension Care for All,"The Target Blood Pressure (BP) initiative is a nationwide movement to improve blood pressure control for almost half of American adults living with hypertension. Over a thousand health care organizations have signed on to the program, which was developed by the American Heart Association (AHA) and American Medical Association. Participating organizations have access to various resources, including continuing medical education and assessments to optimize their clinical practices. Achievement awards are granted to those who successfully move the needle and demonstrate better patient outcomes.1
We spoke to Howard Haft, MD, MMM, for a deeper dive into the initiative. Dr Haft is the chair of the American Heart Association Outpatient Quality Improvement Advisory Group, former executive director of the Maryland Primary Care Program, and adjunct professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.
The Target BP initiative has 3 primary focus areas: measure, act, and partner (MAP). It calls on health care providers to accurately measure blood pressure using the latest positioning guidelines, initiate a clear and proactive treatment plan for hypertensive patients, and empower patients to self-monitor.1
One of the key aspects of self-measurement is digital blood pressure monitors. “I’m excited about digital blood pressure monitoring,” said Dr Haft. “I remember older blood pressure devices with mercury, which have largely gone by the wayside. Handheld blood pressure cuffs are notoriously difficult to calibrate. Now, digital blood pressure machines are calibrated right out of the box and don’t need to be recalibrated as frequently.”
He also feels digital monitors are more reliable and less prone to errors. “Digital blood pressure machines also take a lot of the guesswork out of the Korotkoff sounds, which can be subjective and lead to significant differences in accuracy. We’re really encouraging people to self-measure their blood pressure because what you get in the office visit tells you their blood pressure in a white coat situation a few times per year,” he explained.
Another major priority of the initiative is equity. Dr Haft said, “We know that [hypertension] is a big problem, particularly for marginalized communities, because they have a higher incidence of hypertension and greater consequences, like amputations and kidney disease.”
“I think we’ll find enormous value when we look at data through a lens of equity,” shared Dr Haft. “Equity measures avoid the pitfall of relying only on the average performance of a population. Within a population, the more privileged patients may have access to gyms, nutrition, medications, and other factors than the less privileged, giving them an easier path to good blood pressure control. Looking at equity-focused quality measures can reveal demographic groups within the overall population with poorer control, allowing more focused blood pressure control interventions.”
Dr Haft has seen the evolution of all the target recognition programs but feels the current intiative is particularly important. “We know there are 120 million people in the US with hypertension, and based on NHANES data, 70% are uncontrolled,” he explained. “Hypertension is a leading cause of renal failure and other complications. Quality improvement and recognition programs are essential.”
As of 2024, participating health care facilities can be found in 47 states or US territories.2 “There’s so much work to be done to improve health and avoid morbidity and mortality. It’s great that the AHA has been doing this and that there’s been continued growth in the program,” emphasized Dr Haft.
“I just looked at recognition data from the springtime, and 1869 organizations submitted data, representing 30 million patients,” shared Dr Haft. “Of these organizations, 1035 received Gold or Gold Plus, which means their organizations are achieving the level of blood pressure control for their patients that’s not achieved in the majority of other adults in the US.”
“Gold or Gold Plus means the organization achieved the requirements for measuring blood pressure accurately and acting rapidly to achieve control. The Gold Plus organizations also achieved the goals in 3 new pillars, which include partnering with patients, self-measured blood pressure, and equitable health care outcomes.”
The Silver Award was granted to 41% of organizations recognized by the program in 2024.2 To achieve this designation, participating facilities had to submit blood pressure control data and complete at least 4 of 6 evidence-based BP activities in the 5 pillars of the program, which include:
The AHA will introduce a new Silver Plus award level for 2025. They also plan to reconfigure the criteria required to reach Gold Plus status.2
The first pillar of the Target BP initiative is accurate blood pressure measurement. A 2024 paper published in JAMA notes that health care providers commonly use improper positioning when checking blood pressure, leading to inaccurate results. Guidelines recommend measuring blood pressure with the arm supported on a desk and the midcuff positioned at the level of the heart. However, it’s not unusual for blood pressures to be taken on arms that are resting on the patient’s lap or not supported at all.4
The crossover randomized clinical trial included 133 adults. Researchers observed that systolic BP was overestimated by 3.9 mm Hg and diastolic BP by 4.0 mm Hg in patients whose arm was supported on their laps. Taking blood pressure on an unsupported arm consistently led to overestimating systolic BP by 6.5 mm Hg and diastolic BP by 4.4 mm Hg.4
The Target BP initiative has created an infographic that displays the correct positioning for measuring blood pressure. Along with posting this infographic in rooms where blood pressures are taken, additional goals that fall under this pillar include:
By focusing on accurate blood pressure measurement first, health care providers can take on the next pillars of the Target BP initiative, including treating blood pressure and teaching patients how to measure it at home correctly.
According to Dr Haft, “If we’re going to improve our nation’s hypertension control and improve our overall health performance compared to other countries, we need to eliminate the barriers to high-value care and address the social and nonmedical challenges faced by vulnerable populations. The Target BP initiative speaks specifically to equitable health outcomes.”
He said he would like to see the current work on the Target BP initiative continue to scale up with a greater focus on strengthing local community networks. “The Strive for Silver was done last year in addition to the nationwide program. We’re looking at smaller cohorts to help local organizations connect and support each other. We’re looking forward to expanding that regional work,” he explained.
Dr Haft also feels that the information collected through the Target BP program will help advance treatment and research. “The most exciting thing I see now is the registry work. AHA has developed an ambulatory AHA registry with over 300,000 patients from organizations nationwide, providing real-time data at the EMR [electronic medical record] level. This is a world of difference from what we do in the standard approach of recognition programs: data extraction by attestations. Real-time data sharing allows organizations to look at their own demographics to benchmark data points against others for reflection. Researchers can also access that.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/trumps-restrictions-on-health-agencies-prompt-concerns-about-cancer-research/,Trump’s Restrictions on Health Agencies Prompt Concerns About Cancer Research,"Researchers, federal employees, and members of the public have voiced concerns about restrictions recently placed on federal health agencies.1-8 Last week, President Donald Trump instructed these agencies to pause communications and travel, which has raised concerns about public health threats and delays impacting medical research, particularly cancer research. Researchers have already reported delays related to research funding and an inability to purchase supplies for ongoing clinical trials.
This all began on January 21, when the Trump administration instructed federal health agencies to pause communications to the public.1-3 A memo sent by Dorothy Fink, MD, acting Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), directed HHS agencies to refrain from publishing any communication — including regulations, guidance documents, and social media posts — until it has been approved by a presidential appointee.
The memo also directed employees of federal health agencies to obtain approval before participating in any public speaking engagements and to coordinate with presidential appointees before issuing official correspondence to public officials.1 The memo outlined that exceptions could be requested for communications related to “critical health, safety, environmental, financial, or national security functions,” but these requests would be reviewed by the Office of the Executive Secretary. The directive is in effect through February 1.
An anonymous source familiar with the memo told CNN that it is not unheard of for an incoming administration to ask to review information before it is publicly released, but the scope of this directive seemed unusual.2 Another anonymous source said there were no similar directives issued at the beginning of the last 2 administrations.The Trump administration has also paused travel and cancelled external meetings for HHS employees.4-8 On January 22, Glenda Conroy, travel chief at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), informed senior NIH officials that HHS-sponsored travel would be paused immediately.5 Employees returning home could complete their journeys, and employees from the Indian Health Service are exempt from this restriction, but all other HHS-sponsored travel has been paused indefinitely.
As a result of the restrictions, health agencies have called off meetings with external groups, including grant review meetings at the NIH, which will delay awards of federal grants for medical research.4-7 The restrictions are also preventing NIH staff from meeting with patient groups and releasing information to recruit patients to trials, an NIH employee told ScienceInsider.5Anonymous sources at the NIH told CNN that the communication restrictions paused purchasing for ongoing trials as well.8 Researchers told CNN last week that they weren’t able to order needed supplies, and continued restrictions could impact trial results. NIH employees have since been informed that they can order supplies from certain vendors.
News of these consequences has been met with public outcry and prompted the spread of some misinformation across social media platforms, including claims that the Trump administration has cancelled cancer research.
Though the restrictions have already impacted — and may continue to impact — federally-funded medical research, there have been no reports of trials being cancelled. In addition, research funded by industry, foundations, and other non-government organizations is not impacted by the restrictions, which means a sizable proportion of US cancer research is not affected. Though data suggest the NIH is a major funder of cancer research, a study of global funding for cancer research awarded during 2016-2020 showed that, in the US, non-government funding sources outnumbered federal funding sources.9,10 A subsequent study of more than 26,000 US cancer trials enrolling patients during 2008-2022 revealed that most trials were solely sponsored by industry (31.7%) and other non-government sources (35.0%).11
People have also raised concerns that health agencies may be unable to communicate health threats to the public while the pause on official communications is in place. An anonymous HHS official told NBC News that the communication freeze could include several reports from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on H5N1 that were set to be released on January 23, a gap in reporting that comes amidst rising cases of the bird flu.3
“Not a day goes by when CDC isn’t tracking a potential threat to our health,” Richard Besser, MD, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the CDC, said in a statement.2 “Cutting off communications from CDC puts our health at risk and prevents our doctors, nurses, and public health leaders in our communities from doing their jobs. I urge the administration to quickly lift the pause.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/even-1-drink-a-day-elevates-cancer-risk/,Even 1 Drink a Day Elevates Cancer Risk,"The Conversation — Many people use the new year to reflect on their relationship with alcohol. Just-released government guidelines are giving Americans another reason to consider a “dry January.”
Over the past few decades, mounting scientific evidence has shown that as little as 1-2 alcoholic drinks per day can lead to increases in the likelihood of several cancers. This prompted the US Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, to release a new Surgeon General Advisory on January 3, 2025, warning about the link between alcohol and cancer. This report highlighted the evidence and included a call for new cancer warning labels on alcoholic beverages.
The association between alcohol and cancer isn’t new news – scientists have been trying to determine the link for decades – yet most people aren’t aware of the risks and may only associate drinking with liver diseases like cirrhosis. In a 2019 survey from the American Institute for Cancer Research, less than half of Americans identified alcohol as a risk factor for cancer.
Alcohol is the third-most preventable cause of cancer in the US, putting it just behind tobacco and obesity. As the surgeon general’s report highlights, alcohol is associated with approximately 100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 cancer deaths every year, playing a role in breast, liver, colorectal, mouth, throat, esophagus, and voice box cancer cases. Alcohol-induced cancer deaths outnumber alcohol-associated traffic crash fatalities every year.
The report included the suggestion to add warning labels to alcohol similar to what is already required for tobacco products – another substance of abuse known to cause cancer.
As a neuroscientist specializing in the neurobiological effects of alcohol use and binge drinking, I am glad to see the call to action for reducing alcohol consumption in the United States.
With so few people aware of the links between alcohol consumption and various cancers – and the fact that the vast majority of people consume some alcohol every week – it’s easy to see why the surgeon general is calling for greater awareness. The 22-page report highlights what scientists know about the relationship between alcohol and cancer, and suggests actions for moving forward. Those include label changes on alcohol, which have not been updated since they were created in 1988.
Somewhat strikingly, breast cancer carries a large portion of this risk – making it particularly worrisome in the face of increased alcohol use among women.
These numbers don’t only apply to heavy alcohol drinkers. While less alcohol is better, 25% of these cancer cases were in people classified as moderate drinkers – consuming, on average, fewer than two drinks per day. This means that anyone regularly drinking alcohol, even small amounts, should know about and understand the risks.
Surgeon General’s advisories are the primary way that the Department of Health and Human Services, where the Office of the Surgeon General resides, communicate health issues of great importance to the public. Surgeon General’s advisories are not necessarily breaking news, but they take the opportunity to bring public awareness to science surrounding big public health issues.
The relationship between alcohol and cancer has been clear to scientists for decades. In fact, it was highlighted in a 2016 surgeon general’s report as well, which focused on addiction more broadly.
The new report outlines the different types of evidence supporting this link. One way is through epidemiological science, which tries to understand patterns and relationships between the rates of cancer and how much alcohol people consumed. Another is through experimental animal studies, which allow scientists to understand the mechanism and causality of these connections as they apply to specific cancers. Together, studies conclusively show a link and pathway between alcohol consumption and cancer.
The surgeon general’s report highlights four key pathways through which alcohol can cause cancer. These largely focus on the ways alcohol can negatively affect your DNA, the building blocks of cells. While the healthy cells in your body divide all the time, their abnormal growth can be driven by aberrant factors like alcohol-induced DNA damage.
This DNA damage leads to uncontrollable growth of tissue instead of healthy, normal tissue growth. This abnormal tissue growth is cancer. The four pathways through which alcohol can lead to cancer highlighted in the report are:
The biggest question on people’s minds right now is likely “how much alcohol can I safely drink?” and the answer to that might disappoint you – probably none.
Alcohol use remains one of the most preventable risk factors for cancer. Even moderate alcohol consumption – one or fewer drinks per day – may elevate cancer risk for some types, such as breast, throat, and mouth cancers.
But none of these studies can tell you what your individual risk for cancer is. The relationship between alcohol and cancer can be influenced by your genes, such as those that control the enzymes that metabolize alcohol, and other lifestyle factors that influence the rates of cancer broadly, like diet and inflammation. All of these lifestyle and personal health factors can influence how risky alcohol consumption is for you.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that if you choose to drink, consider sticking to less than 1 for women or 2 for men, standard servings of alcohol per day – which might be smaller than you think, and don’t binge drink alcohol at all. The surgeon general is also suggesting a rethinking of these guidelines to include updated limits on daily alcohol consumption and greater educational efforts around the link between alcohol and cancer.
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has similar recommendations around limiting alcohol consumption and advises that for people who choose to drink alcohol, “the less, the better.”
The institute offers tips on its website for managing your alcohol consumption or abstaining from alcohol consumption altogether, including finding alternative hobbies and activities, identifying what leads to your urges to drink and having a plan to handle urges, and identifying a strategy for saying “no” to an alcoholic beverage in social settings.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/do-pas-exist-to-optimize-salary-or-provide-quality-care/,Do PAs Exist to Optimize Salary or to Provide Quality Care?,"A January 2025 piece in the Journal of the American Academy of Physician Associates (JAAPA) reveals some compelling questions about why physician associates (PAs) exist.
The informative piece looks at the impact of the Doctoral of Medical Science credential on PA practice. The survey article claims to examine the characteristics and effect of a doctor of medical science (DMSc) on the careers of PA graduates and concludes that the doctoral degree “was considered a positive career benefit by graduates.”
I found several things about the piece puzzling and worthy of further examination. Surveys are often self-serving, and this piece was no exception.
A few things jumped out at me as I reviewed the JAAPA article. First, the authors caught my attention with all 7 PA of them citing either DMSc or DHSc credentials. Secondly, the article chose to focus only on the perceived benefits of the doctoral degree, without any discussion about whether there is any evidence that the quality of care provided by doctoral degree PAs is any different than that provided by PAs without such a degree.
I’ve always been disturbed when such discussions fail to consider the quality of care, instead focusing on “positive career benefits” such as compensation, promotions, leadership opportunities, and career advancement. These are of course important factors in our work as PAs, but I am struck by the lack of discussion about how such factors relate to our core responsibility to provide the highest quality of care to our patients.
The article raised these important questions for me:
In the end, I think that our fascination with advanced degrees reflects the capitalist values that guide our troubled medical system. As we continue to move toward expensive advanced degrees, based on some vague belief that we must keep up with professions that we wrongly identify as our competitors, it takes us “out of our game” and moves us away from where we should be focused, which is on our commitment to provide high-quality care for the patients that we were born to serve.","Jim Anderson, MPAS, PA-C, DFAAPA"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/acquitted-np-sues-government-for-false-arrest/,Acquitted NP Sues Government for False Arrest,"Ms K was a nurse practitioner in Indiana. Between 2001 and 2015, state law only allowed certain licensed physicians to prescribe Schedule III and Schedule IV controlled substances for weight loss purposes. There was, however, an exception for Advanced Practice Nurses (APNs).
These nurses were allowed to prescribe these medications if they, among other things:
1. Possessed a valid state Controlled Substances number
2. Possessed a valid Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) registration number
3. Submitted proof of the APN’s collaboration with a licensed medical practitioner to the State Board of Nursing.
Using another person’s DEA registration number to prescribe controlled substances was, and still is, a felony in the state.
Ms K owned and operated a family health practice under the guidance of 2 licensed physicians. She obtained a state Controlled Substances number in August of 2014, but never received a DEA registration number. Ms K entered into a collaboration agreement with Dr A from August 2009 until March 2014. She also signed a collaboration agreement with Dr B in February 2014, but the licensing agency did not receive it until August 2014. Ms K continued to write prescriptions without a valid collaboration agreement from February through August 2014.
Between 2012 and 2014, Ms K wrote approximately 1500 prescriptions for phentermine and phendimetrazine – Schedule III and IV controlled substances used for weight loss – using Dr A and Dr B’s DEA numbers. Patient charts, which had prescriptions for these medications, show that the physicians reviewed and signed the charts as required by the collaboration agreement.
In 2013, a state investigation into Ms K’s prescribing practices began after a pharmacist raised a red flag. Officers informed Ms K that it was a violation of state law for nurses to prescribe weight loss medications. Ms K claimed the law didn’t apply to her since her supervising physicians knew and approved of the practice.
A DEA Diversion Investigator soon became involved. Doctors A and B told the investigator that they did not authorize Ms K to use their DEA numbers to write prescriptions. Dr A terminated her collaboration agreement with Ms K after learning that her DEA number had been used to write the prescriptions.
As part of the investigation, the DEA investigator spoke to directors at the state Professional Licensing Agency and the State Board of Nursing. Both confirmed that only physicians, not APNs, were permitted to prescribe Schedule III and IV controlled substances for weight loss under state law. Accordingly, the DEA investigator signed a probable cause affidavit, and Ms K was arrested and charged with unlawfully prescribing and distributing controlled substances. She maintained that she had done nothing wrong and that Doctors A and B had known their DEA numbers were being used for this purpose. The case eventually went to trial, and Ms K was acquitted.
After the trial, the Nursing Board initially revoked her nursing license; however, it was reinstated after a court reversed the Board’s decision.
Following her acquittal, Ms K hired an attorney and sued the DEA investigator and the government for false arrest and malicious prosecution. The district court dismissed the case, and Ms K appealed. On appeal, Ms K maintained that the arrest warrant was not supported by probable cause because she was later acquitted of the charges and her nursing license reinstated.
Ultimately, the United States Court of Appeals agreed with the lower court that Ms K did not have a viable case. Why?
The requirements for the existence of probable cause are different than those required to convict someone. This is very important to remember. This is why an arrest does not equate to guilt – it only means that there was enough evidence to arrest the person… not necessarily to convict the person. If investigators could be sued anytime they arrested someone who was later not convicted, there would be hundreds of lawsuits and investigators would be fearful to do their jobs.
The Court noted in its decision that “Probable cause exists if a reasonable officer in similar circumstances would believe that the accused had committed a crime given the facts and circumstances known to the officer when either making the arrest or seeking an arrest warrant. Probable cause is not evaluated in hindsight, but on the facts as they appeared to a reasonable person even if that reasonable belief turned out to be incorrect. Although the officer must consider the elements of the applicable criminal statute in making the probable cause determination, he is under no duty to find conclusive proof that the crime occurred.”
Ultimately, the Court held that a reasonable officer in the inspector’s position could have believed the evidence that Ms K was prescribing weight loss medications in violation of state law. There was no indication that the inspector was acting in bad faith or with reckless disregard for the truth. It wasn’t his responsibility to act as the judge or jury. The issue was inspector “had a reasonable, good faith belief that probable cause existed to arrest Ms K for prescribing controlled substances unlawfully.” Probable cause is an absolute bar to bringing these sorts of lawsuits.
The Court affirmed the decision of the lower court and held that Ms K’s claims were barred.
There are 3 important lessons to be learned from this case. The first lesson has to do with collaborative practice agreements. It is extremely important to understand what is required in your state and how much supervision is necessary. It’s also crucial to use great care when prescribing Controlled Substances for any purpose. Make sure that you are complying with both state and federal regulations. Ms K might have avoided the arrest and trial by having her own DEA number.
The second important takeaway is the difference between probable cause for arrest and the level of evidence necessary for conviction. These are far different. There is a much higher bar to convict someone than there is to arrest a person. This is why you always hear that an arrest is not evidence of guilt – only a conviction or guilty plea is.
And finally, it is almost impossible to sue for false arrest or malicious prosecution without proof of malice, reckless disregard, or bad faith. Simply getting arrested, even if you’ve done nothing, is not enough.","Ann W. Latner, JD"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/back-pain-prevention-and-risk-factors-patients-may-not-know/,Back Pain Prevention and Risk Factors Patients May Not Know,"Back pain, lower back pain in particular, is one of the most common forms of pain patients experience. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), lower back pain affected 619 million people worldwide in 2020, and they anticipate that figure increasing to 843 million by 2050 due to a variety of factors.¹
Whether acute or chronic, back pain can be a debilitating experience that significantly reduces a patient’s quality of life. It is a physically constricting condition that can negatively affect a person’s sleep and mood and can get worse if not treated or managed. With lower back pain considered the most common worldwide disability,¹ patient education on factors that may put them at risk is crucial.
There are risk factors for back pain that may surprise patients looking for answers, and preventive measures they may not yet know about that could help them. What are some of the more notable risk factors and preventive tactics for dealing with, or averting back pain?
As it is such a common ailment, back pain has a number of risk factors that vary in terms of modifiability. Some of these risk factors are common and well-known, though patients may benefit from a deeper understanding of how they contribute to back pain. Other factors may not be as well-known by patients but could be a strong contributor to their ailment.
One of the most common risk factors in back pain, particularly low back pain, is obesity and body mass index (BMI). A 2019 study published in Arthritis Care & Research examined risk factors for low back pain and lumbar radicular pain in adults 30 or over and found obesity to be one of the strongest links to back pain.² In particular, researchers concluded that abdominal obesity was linked to increased low back pain risk, and general obesity correlated with increased risk for lumbar radicular pain.
Other studies have come to similar conclusions. Published in The Lancet Rheumatology in 2023, an analysis of the national and global burden of low back pain from 1990 to 2020 found a high BMI to be one of the strongest factors for low back pain and resulting years lived with disability.³ The researchers found BMI to be strongest as a risk factor among females aged 50 to 69, and lowest among males aged 15 to 49. Researchers of a study published in JAMA Network Open in 2021 also found obesity to be a risk factor not just in low back pain, but in the transition from acute to chronic low back pain.⁴
Researchers of the JAMA Network Open study also concluded that smoking status was a significant factor in the transition to chronic low back pain.⁴ Cigarettes are a commonly noted risk factor in back pain, and increased or continued smoking may be linked to greater pain. A 2016 study in Cureus, examining a pool of 34,525 American adults, found 36.9% of current smokers in the pool had back pain, compared to an overall back pain incidence of 28%.⁵ This was also a higher percentage than the 33.5% of former smokers experiencing back pain, as well as the 23.5% of those who had never smoked.
Researchers also found that among the current smokers, those with back pain had a higher median number of daily cigarettes than those without back pain.
Depending on certain circumstances, both physical activity and a lack of physical activity could be risk factors for back pain. Occupational physical activity, at jobs with more lifting, bending, and other physical demands, is often associated with an increased risk of low back pain.³ However, occupations with a prolonged amount of sitting or standing are also linked to low back pain risk. Health care professionals working with patients suffering from back pain may want to discuss occupational factors when determining potential reasons for acute or chronic back pain.
Though people of any age can experience low back pain, aging can often put patients at increased risk of back pain. According to WHO, the highest number of lower back pain cases happen among patients aged 50 to 55 years.¹ The prevalence and disability of cases continue well after this age range, however; patients aged 80 to 85 years experience the highest disability impact from lower back pain. One of the largest reasons WHO anticipates such a substantial increase in cases of lower back pain by 2050 is due to an increasingly aging population.
Stress, depression, and anxiety are all considered possible risk factors for developing back pain. The researchers of the previously referenced JAMA Network Open study, for example, noted that 6% of the patients and survey respondents considered in the study had a diagnosis of depression or anxiety.⁴ In patients with otherwise unidentified causes of back pain depression, and fear-avoidance behavior may be associated with an increased risk and severity of back pain.⁶ Other factors relating to mental health, such as job and compensation-related stressors, may also affect back pain outcomes.
In a 2023 study published in the Annals of Geriatric Medicine and Research about the potential bidirectional relationship between loneliness and back pain, the researchers note that struggles with social relationships and acceptance are often predictors of experiencing chronic pain.⁷ The researchers also found that loneliness may also lead to pain in its ability to cause an over-activated stress response; in analyzing possible bidirectional associations between loneliness and back pain using data from the national English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, they concluded that loneliness may be a risk factor for back pain and that loneliness interventions may be an effective method of lessening back pain risk.
Patient education and interventions are critical to avoiding back pain development or worsening symptom severity. Researchers of a study published in Frontiers in Public Health in 2024, reviewing the data of a cross-sectional survey of patients of a general practitioner clinic in Poland, found that over half of the survey respondents did not engage in preventive behaviors to avoid back pain.⁸ Respondents who had undergone treatment for lower back pain or exercised at least once a week, however, were more adequately prepared to prevent the pain.
Preventing back pain means actively working against these risk factors. Health care professionals should warn patients who smoke that it may contribute to the likelihood of back pain, as well as advise patients who are not active and are overweight that these factors may contribute as well.
Treatments for low back pain can be a good resource for strengthening the back before significant pain occurs. Lifestyle changes such as physical activity and building better sleep habits are often used for this, as are physical therapies and active choices to reduce strain when doing physical labor.¹ However, there are concerns about how successful these interventions can be the longer back pain occurs. As such, stressing the importance of preventive measures as early as possible is the best method for working with patients to prevent chronic back pain.",Steve Fiorillo
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/dermatologic-clinic-pink-papule-left-ankle/,Dermatologic Clinic: Pink Papule on Left Ankle,"A 41-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents with a solitary nodule on her lower left ankle. The lesion has been growing over the past several months. The patient first thought it was a wart; however, it grew to a size that she thought was a bit big for a wart. Over the past few weeks, it has stopped growing. The nodule is non-tender, asymptomatic, and does not exhibit any drainage. It is only painful when it gets caught on her sock. Upon physical examination, the nodule was firm but not hard.
Eccrine poromas were first described by Pinkus and his colleagues, Rogin and Goldman, in 1939, who used the term to describe a benign lesion on a foot that exhibited a specific histological appearance.1 Pinkus emphasized the distinct histologic features of the neoplasm, as it differed from adnexal neoplasms or seborrheic keratosis and was composed of poroid cells.
Regarding the epidemiology of eccrine poromas, they occur predominantly in middle aged and older adults, with a slight female predilection. These tumors can be rare, as they account for less than 1% of cutaneous tumors.1 Eccrine poromas most often arise in eccrine gland-rich areas and are therefore most commonly located on acral surfaces, such as the palms, soles, and lateral aspects of the feet.2 Although rare, poromas can occur on the scalp, largely due to the high density of sweat glands on the scalp.2 In these cases, they are sometimes associated with a nevus sebaceus, and are thus more likely to be apocrine poromas.
Eccrine poromas, or poromas in general, arise from poroid (terminal ductal) differentiation, or the acrosyringium.2 Poromas can be either of eccrine or apocrine lineage. Up to 89% of poromas that arise sporadically contain YAP1-MAML2 and YAP1-NUTM1 fusion genes, which can lead to the formation of the neoplasm presumably by activation of the transcription factor TEAD (transcriptional enhanced associate domain).2,3  Therefore, immunohistochemical staining for NUT may be useful in differentiating poroid neoplasms with NUTM1 fusion from other adnexal neoplasms.3 Genetic studies have also identified somatic mutations in HRAS and KRAS, suggesting a molecular basis for some cases.4
Immunosuppressed individuals, such as patients with HIV, or undergoing chemotherapy, may be at increased risk for the development of poromas.5 Additionally, mechanical trauma or chronic irritation to eccrine-gland dense areas might contribute to the formation of a lesion.
Poromatosis, a clinical condition characterized by multiple poromas, develops rarely after chemotherapy or radiation therapy.2,5 These lesions may appear in an acral distribution or be more widely spread across the skin.
Clinically, eccrine poromas typically present as a slow-growing, painless, solitary, firm papule. They are often pink, red, or flesh-toned. They tend to grow slowly. The typical size is less than 2 cm.6 The lesion is characterized by well-defined borders, often described as resembling a thin, indented moat.2 Upon palpation, the lesion is firm but not hard. In somecases the surface can appear as an eroded plaque.
When viewed by dermatoscope, poromas exhibit prominent vascular structures such as hairpin, linear-irregular, or glomerular vessels, often surrounded by a whitish halo.7
Histologically, poromas are well-circumscribed and composed of proliferating compact cuboidal keratinocytes with small monomorphous nuclei and scant eosinophilic cytoplasm.2 Small ductal spaces can be observed. There is loose vascular stroma between the tumor lobules. These cuboidal keratinocytes are more basophilic in comparison to the surrounding stroma. The histologic classification of poromas is based on the depth and location of the collection of monomorphous poroid cells. If the cells are entirely intra-epidermal, then the lesion is referred to as a hidroacanthoma simplex. If the cells are in broad continuity with the epidermis, then it is referred to as a juxta-epidermal poroma. If the cells are entirely within the dermis, then the lesion is called a dermal duct tumor.2
The differential diagnosis for a granular cell tumor is broad, emphasizing the importance of skin biopsy for a more definitive diagnosis. Other entities to consider in the differential diagnosis of a poroma include seborrheic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, pyogenic granuloma, hidradenoma, melanocytic lesions, verruca, other adnexal neoplasm, and glomus tumor.2,5
A skin biopsy is paramount for diagnosis, as histopathology reveals classic cuboidal keratinocytes with monomorphous nuclei. A punch biopsy can be done if the lesion is large and cannot be removed in its entirety. For a small papule, shave biopsy is preferred. Staining for CEA (positive due to ductal differentiation) and GATA3 (positive in hidroacanthoma simplex but negative in seborrheic keratoses) can aid in the diagnosis.2
Because eccrine poromas are benign lesions, treatment is optional and depends on the patient’s preference after confirmation of the diagnosis with a skin biopsy. If the lesion is superficial, a shave or electrodessication can be used to remove it. If the lesion extends deeper, and the patient desires removal, then a small surgical excision can be performed.
The patient in this case was counseled regarding the biopsy results, and as the entire lesion appeared to have been removed during the biopsy, no additional treatments were conducted.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/wildfire-smoke-inside-homes-create-health-risks/,Wildfire Smoke Inside Homes Can Create Health Risks That Linger for Months,"The Conversation — The world has been watching the dramatic images of the fires in Los Angeles, California. When wildfires spread into neighborhoods, they burn all kinds of materials found in cars and houses and everything around them – electronics, paint, plastics, furniture.
Research shows that the mix of chemicals released when human-made materials like these burn is different from what is emitted during a vegetation fire and is potentially more toxic. The smoke and ash can blow under doors and around windows in nearby homes, bringing in chemicals that are absorbed into furniture, walls, and other indoor surfaces and continue off-gassing for weeks to months.
As people return to smoke-damaged homes after a wildfire, there are several steps they can take to protect their health before starting to clean.
In 2021, after the Marshall Fire swept through neighborhoods near Boulder, Colorado, my colleagues and I at Colorado universities and labs heard from many residents who were worried about the ash and lingering smells inside their homes that had otherwise survived the flames.
In homes that my colleagues were able to quickly test, they found elevated levels of metals and PAHs – polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons – in the ash. We also found elevated VOCs – volatile organic compounds – in airborne samples. Some VOCs, such as dioxins, benzene, formaldehyde and PAHs, can be toxic to humans. Benzene is a known carcinogen.
At the time, we could find no information about physical health implications for people who have returned to smoke-damaged homes after a wildfire. So, to look for patterns, we surveyed residents affected by the fire 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after the fire.
Even 6 months after the fire, we found that many people were reporting symptoms that aligned with health risks related to smoke and ash from fires.
More than half (55%) reported that they were experiencing at least one symptom six months after the blaze that they attributed to the Marshall Fire. The most common symptoms reported were itchy or watery eyes (33%), headache (30%), dry cough (27%), sneezing (26%) and sore throat (23%).
All of these symptoms, as well as having a strange taste in one’s mouth, were associated with people reporting that their home smelled differently when they returned to it one week after the fire.
Many survey respondents said that the smells decreased over time. Most attributed the improvement in smell to the passage of time, cleaning surfaces and air ducts, replacing furnace filters, and removing carpet, textiles and furniture from the home. Despite this, many still had symptoms.
We also found that living near a large number of burned structures was associated with these health symptoms. We found that for every 10 additional destroyed buildings within 820 feet (250 meters) of a person’s home, there was an associated 21% increase in headaches and a 26% increase in having a strange taste in their mouth.
These symptoms align with what could be expected from exposure to the chemicals that we found in the ash and measured in the air inside the few smoke-damaged homes that we were able to study in depth.
There are still a lot of unanswered questions about the health risks from smoke- and ash-damaged homes.
For example, we don’t yet know what long-term health implications might look like for people living with lingering gases from wildfire smoke and ash in a home. We found a significant decline in the number of people reporting symptoms one year after the fire. However, 33% percent of the people whose homes were affected and responded to a later survey still reported at least one symptom that they attributed to the fire. About the same percentage also reported at least one symptom two years after the fire.
We also could not measure the level of VOCs or metals that each person was exposed to. But we do think that reports of a change in the smell of a person’s home one week after the fire demonstrates the likely presence of VOCs in the home. That likely has health implications for people whose homes are exposed to smoke or ash from a wildfire.
Wildfires are increasingly burning homes and other structures as more people move into the wildland-urban interface, temperatures rise and fire seasons lengthen.
If your home survives a wildfire nearby, here are some of the steps to think about before starting to clean:

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/diagnosis-of-cte-increases-with-each-year-of-ice-hockey-play/,Diagnosis of CTE Increases With Each Year of Ice Hockey Play,"A diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) increases with each additional year of ice hockey played, according to study results published in JAMA Network Open.
Previous research has indicated a dose-response association between amount of contact sports played and the occurrence and severity of CTE. However, little is known about the effect of repetitive head impacts (RHI) from ice hockey and CTE severity.
Researchers conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the link between duration of ice hockey played and risk and severity of CTE.
Brain donors were enrolled in the Understanding Neurological Injury and Traumatic Encephalopathy (UNITE) and Framingham Heart Study (FHS) brain banks and whose primary RHI was from organized ice hockey play. All study participants were male athletes.
Primary sport exposure was years playing ice hockey as an RHI proxy. Ice hockey play duration was defined as total number of years of organized play.
The researchers collected retrospective data from all donors (via their informants) and their medical records were reviewed. CTE neuropathologic diagnosis was based on National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NINDS-NIBIB) criteria.
Of 77 donors (median age, 51 years; White, 100%) identified in the study, 42 were diagnosed with CTE and the remaining 35 were not. The most common causes of death in those with CTE were suicide and neurodegenerative disease (28.6% and 26.2%, respectively). The majority of former professional ice hockey players had CTE (96.4%).
The CTE rate was directly related to number of years of ice hockey play — 95.8% of donors with CTE played more than 23 years; 51.9% of donors with CTE played between 13 and 23 years; and 19.2% of donors played fewer than 13 years.
After adjusting for age at death, number of concussions, and play in other contact sports, the researchers noted a dose-response association between CTE diagnosis and increased duration of ice hockey play (odds ratio [OR] per 1-year increase in hockey play, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.15-1.55; P <.001) and increased ptau burden (0.037; 95% CI, 0.017-0.057; P <.001).
Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for duration of ice hockey play and CTE diagnosis was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.81-0.96). This indicated that duration of ice hockey play may be a good predictor of CTE diagnosis. Overall, those with vs without CTE were approximately 10 times more likely to have played at least 18 years of ice hockey (sensitivity, 0.70; specificity, 0.93).
Limitations of the analysis included the relatively small sample size with limited distribution of players across all levels of the sport; potential recall bias while gathering information regarding clinical data; and that duration of play was not an exact measure for RHI exposure.
“Similar to findings in American football, these findings implicate ice hockey play as a risk factor associated with CTE and associated clinical outcomes,” the researchers concluded.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/prostate-cancer-treatment/,Prostate Cancer Treatment Challenge: Which Drugs to Use First,"Over the past 14 years, clinicians have seen rapid growth in their therapeutic armamentarium to treat advanced prostate cancer. They can now choose among 4 novel second-generation hormone therapies (the androgen receptor pathway inhibitors [ARPIs] abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide), 2 chemotherapy agents (docetaxel and cabazitaxel), 2 radiopharmaceuticals (radium-223 and lutetium-177-PSMA-617), 4 PARP inhibitors (olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib), and a vaccine (sipuleucel-T). These medications can delay disease progression and prolong life, but their optimal use—such as which drug or drug combinations should be used first to achieve the best outcomes from prostate cancer treatment—is still being worked out.
Nevertheless, standards of care, or at least consensus on the best approaches in various clinical scenarios, have evolved based on accumulating evidence of efficacy and safety, advances in imaging that allow for more accurate cancer staging (such as prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography [PSMA PET]), and the use of genomic and other biomarkers that predict prostate cancer aggressiveness. Among the overarching trends is earlier and earlier treatment intensification to forestall development of metastases and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
Medical societies regularly update guidelines in response to the latest data. For example, American Urological Association guidelines recommend either enzalutamide, apalutamide, or darolutamide in addition to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for patients with nonmetastatic CRPC at high risk for metastases. American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend triplet therapy consisting of either darolutamide or abiraterone combined with docetaxel and ADT for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).
Triplet therapy with docetaxel plus an ARPI and ADT has become a widely accepted first-line treatment for patients with high-volume synchronous mHSPC—especially for those with visceral metastases—and who can tolerate chemotherapy, said Andrew J. Armstrong, MD, ScM, professor of medicine, surgery, pharmacology, and cancer biology at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, where he is Director of Research at the Duke Cancer Institute Center for Prostate and Urologic Cancers. Doublet therapy is recommended for patients with metachronous low-volume disease.
Trial data support ADT/ARPI doublet therapy and radiation to the primary tumor (and possibly metastasis-directed radiation) for patients with synchronous low-volume disease, Dr Armstrong said. Patients with metachronous high-volume disease, a rare subgroup, may benefit from triplet therapy in selected cases, he said.
Still, there is room for improvement. “In the end, we would all benefit from more precise biomarkers of docetaxel benefit in this setting … and trials testing the value of docetaxel over doublet ADT/ARPI therapy,” he said.
Recent network meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have attempted to interpret data across trials to arrive at which first-line therapy for mHSPC and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) would produce the best outcomes. In a network meta-analysis that included 10 RCTs with 11,043 patients with mHSPC, investigators found that triplet therapies of darolutamide plus docetaxel and ADT and abiraterone plus docetaxel and ADT are significantly associated with 32% and 25% lower risks for death, respectively, compared with docetaxel plus ADT doublet therapy, but do not improve survival compared with ARPI doublet therapy.1
Among patients with high-volume disease, triplet therapy with abiraterone plus docetaxel and ADT may improve overall survival compared with docetaxel plus ADT, but not compared with doublet therapies of abiraterone plus ADT, enzalutamide plus ADT, and apalutamide plus ADT, according to findings published in 2023 in JAMA Oncology.1 For patients with low-volume disease, abiraterone plus docetaxel and ADT may not improve overall survival compared with apalutamide plus ADT, abiraterone plus ADT, and enzalutamide plus ADT, and docetaxel plus ADT.
In a separate network meta-analysis published in European Urology Oncology in 2022, which included 11 RCTs with 11,546 patients, investigators concluded that triplet therapy with docetaxel plus an ARPI and ADT had a 77% likelihood of being the best treatment approach for mHSPC compared with a 23% likelihood for doublet therapy with an ARPI plus ADT.2
More recently, in a network meta-analysis of 10 RCTs published in 2024 in the Asian Journal of Andrology, investigators reported that triplet therapy with darolutamide plus docetaxel and ADT offered the best overall survival among patients with mHSPC, followed by a triplet of abiraterone plus docetaxel and ADT.3 The best regimens for improving progression-free survival were the triplet therapies abiraterone or enzalutamide in addition to docetaxel plus ADT and doublet therapies consisting of ARPIs, according to the investigators. The triplet of darolutamide plus docetaxel and ADT offered the best treatment for lowering the risk for development of castration-resistant disease and symptomatic skeletal events. “Darolutamide might be the optimal option for triplet therapy in combination with docetaxel and ADT,” the authors concluded.
Also in 2024, investigators published findings from a network meta-analysis of 7 phase 3 and 4 RCTs with 6641 patients upon which they concluded that chemotherapy offers superior overall survival compared with abiraterone and enzalutamide as first-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), which they acknowledged is not consistent with AUA guidelines.4
Compared with placebo, docetaxel, cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2, and cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 significantly decreased the risk for death by 47%, 47%, and 48%, respectively, the investigators reported in Frontiers in Oncology. In contrast, abiraterone and enzalutamide significantly decreased death risk by 19% and 30%, respectively.
“Our comprehensive analysis revealed that chemotherapy, specifically docetaxel and cabazitaxel, demonstrated superior efficacy and safety compared to second-generation anti-hormonal therapies, including abiraterone, enzalutamide, and apalutamide, in the first-line management of mCRPC,” corresponding author Yinfeng Ma, MD, of The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medicine University in Zhejiang, and colleagues wrote. After weighing the safety and efficacy data, the investigators recommended that cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2 plus prednisone should be the preferred therapy for first-line treatment, followed by docetaxel plus prednisone.
Prostate cancer specialists advise caution in their interpretation of network meta-analyses. Although they can provide useful information, meta-analyses “are not meant to replace the need for randomized phase 3 trials but can look at key questions across trials to infer ranking and superiority of types of therapeutic approaches grounded against a common control group,” Dr Armstrong said.
The meta-analyses of mHSPC trials “all basically confirm concepts that are already well appreciated from the individual analyses of the key phase 3 trials in the mHSPC setting,” he said.
“While meta-analyses are usually very helpful, there are a lot of nuances that they don’t grasp,” said Stephen J. Freedland, MD, Director of the Center for Integrated Research in Cancer and Lifestyle and Associate Director of Cedars-Sinai Cancer at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, California.
With regard to the meta-analysis of mHSPC trials published in the Asian Journal of Andrology, Dr Freedland pointed out that with triplet therapies of chemotherapy combined with ADT and ARPI have only been compared with ADT plus chemotherapy doublet therapy. Consequently, it is unknown whether these triplet regimens are better than doublets of ADT plus an ARPI. In addition, in the CHAARTED trial, a doublet of ADT plus chemotherapy only showed benefit for patients with high-volume disease. “Thus, a blanket recommendation of triplet [therapy] for everyone is not supported by the literature, despite the conclusions of the meta-analysis.”
For high-volume disease, he noted that there is growing consensus that triplet therapy is likely the best approach, but for low-volume disease, most physicians recommend a doublet of ADT plus an ARPI.
As for the meta-analysis finding that chemotherapy is a better choice than an ARPI for the first-line treatment of mCRPC, Dr Freedland observed: “The definitive trials of chemotherapy for mCRPC were more than 10 years ago, prior to the introduction of ARPIs.” This makes it difficult to compare the therapies. “In practice, it is a moot point because no patient wants chemo.” Consequently, first-line therapy for patients who have not received prior treatment for mCPRC is an ARPI, and a meta-analysis will not change this approach given the tolerability and side effect issues with chemotherapy, he said. “Also, ARPIs are very effective, so they are unlikely to be bumped from first-line.”
Moreover, with ARPIs being used more and more prior to mCRPC, chemotherapy is likely to be used increasingly as first- or second-line mCRPC therapy, Dr Freedland added.
Studies that provide potentially useful information that can inform drug sequencing is not limited to RCTs or other large studies. For example, a small real-world study suggests that lutetium-177 PSMA-617 can be used following radium-223 for mCRPC with bone metastases. The agents emit different kinds of radiation (alpha particles and beta particles, respectively). The study included patients who received radium-223 for a median of 6 injections and subsequent lutetium-177-PSMA-617 for a median of 3.5 months. The median time between the treatments was 8 months. The median overall survival was 28 months from the start of radium-223 and 13.2 months from the start of lutetium-177 PSMA, Oliver Sartor, MD, of Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, Louisiana reported in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine.5 The authors acknowledged that their small sample size precludes definitive conclusions, but noted that their data, especially related to the duration of lutetium-177-PSMA-617 therapy, suggest that the use of this medication after radium-223 is feasible in a real-world setting.
Some trends offer the promise of greater clarity about which drugs to use and when to use them. One is growing use of genomic and other biomarkers that can predict prostate cancer aggressiveness and response to therapy. Genetic testing, for example, can detect deleterious mutations in BCRA1/2 or other DNA-repair genes associated with high-risk prostate cancer, which could help decide on treatment. This would be the case with olaparib, a PARP inhibitor indicated for use in patients with certain genomic alterations, including BRCA-mutated mCRPC.
Another trend is growing use of PSMA PET in conjunction with computed tomography (PSMA PET/CT), which can identify metastases earlier and with greater accuracy compared with conventional imaging. The modality also can provide a better estimate of metastatic burden. Findings can help clinicians decide on the appropriateness and type of treatment, including metastasis-directed therapy. PSMA PET/CT already is used to select candidates for lutetium-177-PSMA-617.
Despite a growing array of pharmaceutical options for treating advanced prostate cancer, clinicians often do not follow guidelines regarding their use, according to real-world studies by Dr Freedland and colleagues. In a study of 14,780 men with mCRPC in the fee-for-service Medicare population, they found that 22% of them received no life-prolonging treatment such as ARPIs and chemotherapy after their mCRPC diagnosis, despite guidelines recommending such treatment.6 Guidelines recommend using ADT plus an ARPI as a standard of care for mHSPC, but in a study of 384 patients with de novo mHSPC in the Veterans Health Administration system, only 31% were prescribed this therapy, Dr Freedland and colleagues reported in a poster presentation at the 2024 ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium.7 Another 42% of patients received ADT alone and 26% received first-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogens.
The slow uptake of novel treatments for advanced prostate cancer in clinical practice has not dampened enthusiasm for elucidating the optimal way to prescribe them. Whether through RCTs, retrospective analyses of real-world data, or meta-analyses, they continue to search for strategies that make the best use of these state-of-the-art therapies.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/5-most-frustrating-health-insurer-tactics/,5 Most Frustrating Health Insurer Tactics and Why They Exist,"The Conversation — The US has made great progress in getting more people insured since the Affordable Care Act took effect in 2014. The share of uninsured Americans ages 18 to 64 fell from 18% before the ACA to 9.5% in 2022. And preexisting conditions no longer prevent coverage or lead to an increase in premiums.
Yet even for those with health insurance, coverage does not ensure access to care, much less high-quality and affordable care. Research shows that 1 in 3 Americans seeking care report delaying or forgoing treatment because of the “administrative burdens” of dealing with health insurance and the health care system, creating additional barriers beyond costs.
Some of these are basic tasks, such as scheduling appointments. But others relate to strategies that health insurers use to shape the care that their patients are able to receive – tactics that are often unpopular with both doctors and patients.
In addition, more than 40% of Americans under 65 have high-deductible plans, meaning patients face significant upfront costs to using care. As a result, nearly a quarter are unable to afford care despite being insured.
As scholars of health care quality and policy, we study how the affordability and design of health insurance affects people’s health as well as their out-of-pocket costs.
We’d like to unpack 5 of the most common strategies used by health insurers to ensure that care is medically necessary, cost-effective, or both.
At best, these practices help ensure appropriate care is delivered at the lowest possible cost. At worst, these practices are overly burdensome and can be counterproductive, depriving insured patients of the care they need.
The strategy of denial of claims has gotten a lot of attention in the aftermath of the killing of UnitedHealthcare chief executive officer Brian Thompson, partly because the insurer has higher rates of denials than its peers. Overall, nearly 20% of Americans with coverage through health insurance marketplaces created by the ACA had a claim denied in 2021.
While denial may be warranted in some cases, such as if a particular service isn’t covered by that plan – amounting to 14% of in-network claim denials – more than three-quarters of denials in 2021 did not list a specific reason. This happens after the service has already taken place, meaning that patients are sent a bill for the full amount when claims are denied.
Although the ACA required standardized processes for appealing claims, patients don’t often understand or feel comfortable navigating an appeal. Even if you understand the process, navigating all of the paperwork and logistics of an appeal is time-consuming. Gaps by income and race in pursuing and winning appeals only deepen mistrust among those already struggling to get appropriate care and make ends meet.
Prior authorization requires providers to get approval in advance from the insurer before delivering a procedure or medication – under the guise of “medical necessity” as well as improving efficiency and quality of care.
Although being judicious with high-cost procedures and drugs makes intuitive sense, in practice these policies can lead to delays in care or even death.
In addition, the growing use of artificial intelligence in recent years to streamline prior authorization has come under scrutiny. This includes a 2023 class action lawsuit filed against UnitedHealthcare for algorithmic denials of rehabilitative care, which prompted the federal government to issue new guidelines.
The American Medical Association found that 95% of physicians report that dealing with prior authorization “somewhat” or “significantly” increases physician burnout, and over 90% believe that the requirement negatively affects patients. The physicians surveyed by the association also reported that over 75% of patients “often” or “sometimes” failed to follow through on recommended care due to challenges with prior authorizations.
Doctors and their staff may deal with dozens of prior authorization requests per week on average, which takes time and attention away from patient care. For example, there were nearly 2 prior authorization requests per Medicare Advantage enrollee in 2022 or more than 46 million in total. Prior authorization can be a time-consuming, multistep process that slows down and often blocks patients from receiving care.
Health insurance plans contract with physicians and hospitals to form their networks, with the ACA requiring them to “ensure a sufficient choice of providers.”
If a plan has too small of a network, patients can have a hard time finding a doctor who takes their insurance, or they may have to wait longer for an appointment.
Despite state oversight and regulation, the breadth of plan networks has significantly narrowed over time. Nearly 15% of HealthCare.gov plans had no in-network physicians for at least 1 of 9 major specialties, and over 15% of physicians listed in Medicaid managed-care provider directories saw no Medicaid patients. Inaccurate provider directories amplify the problem, since patients may choose a plan based on bad information and then have trouble finding care.
The No Surprises Act went into effect in 2022 to protect consumers against unexpected bills from care received out of network. These bills usually come with a higher deductible and an out-of-pocket maximum that is typically twice as high as in-network care as well as higher coinsurance rates.
Prior to that law, 18% of emergency visits and 16% of in-network hospital stays led to at least 1 surprise bill.
While the No Surprises Act has helped address some problems, a notable gap is that it does not apply to ambulance services. Nearly 30% of emergency transports and 26% of nonemergency transports may have resulted in a surprise bill between 2014 and 2017.
The largest health insurance companies all have their own pharmacy benefit managers.
Three of them – Aetna’s CVS Caremark, Cigna’s Express Scripts, and UnitedHealthcare’s Optum Rx – processed almost 80% of the total prescriptions dispensed by US pharmacies in 2023.
Beyond how market concentration affects competition and prices, insurers’ owning pharmacy benefit managers exploits a loophole in how much insurers are required to spend on patient care.
The ACA requires insurers to maintain a medical loss ratio of 80% to 85%, meaning they should spend 80 to 85 cents of every dollar of premiums for medical care. Pharmaceuticals account for a growing share of health care spending, and plans are able to keep that money within the parent company through the pharmacy benefit managers that they own.
Moreover, pharmacy benefit managers inflate drug costs to overpay their own vertically integrated pharmacies, which in turn means higher out-of-pocket costs based on the inflated prices. Most pharmacy benefit managers also prevent drug manufacturer co-pay assistance programs from counting toward patients’ cost sharing, such as deductibles, which prolongs how long patients have to pay out of pocket.
Despite how far the US has come in making sure most Americans have access to affordable health insurance, being insured increasingly isn’t enough to guarantee access to the care and medications that they need.
The industry reports that profit margins are only 3% to 6%, yet the billions of dollars in profits they earn every year may feel to many like a direct result of the day-to-day struggles that patients face getting the care they need.
These insurer tactics can adversely affect patients’ health and their trust in the health care system, which leaves patients in unthinkably difficult circumstances. It also undercuts the government’s goal of bringing affordable health care to all.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/empowering-health-equity-hpv-self-sampling-for-cervical-cancer-prevention-in-gender-affirming-care/,Empowering Health Equity: HPV Self-Sampling for Cervical Cancer Prevention in Gender-Affirming Care,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States.1 HPV is a small, nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA virus with over 200 subtypes that exist and infect cutaneous and mucosal epithelial cells.2,3  Although the majority of those exposed to HPV will clear the virus over time without intervention, persistent immune evasion by downregulation of the immune cells can lead to chronic infection.3 Persistent infection with high cancer-risk HPV strains puts a patient at risk for several varieties of cancers in both men and women and are among the most prominent oncogenic infectious agents. Screenings for cervical cancer, including HPV testing, are recommended for all people with a cervix. Unfortunately, several patient groups have been underserved in this area, including transmasculine individuals (TM). Considering the susceptibility and infection rates of TM and cisgender women are comparable; statistics emphasize a need for gender affirming HPV screening options.4
The route of HPV transmission varies among individuals, but it is most commonly spread through mucosal sites via sexual intercourse, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex.5,6 Upon exposure to HPV, the viral access to a basal membrane allows for infection, commonly at cellular transition zones.1  Some studies suggest that HPV inoculation from a genital site to the anus is common in those who have female anatomy.6 Table 1 describes the common sites of HPV, routes of transmission, and corresponding transition zones.
Table 1. Common Routes of Transmission of Human Papillomavirus1,5-7
Figure 1. The transition zone is shown in this image as the squamo-columnar junction at the external oz of the cervix.7
The various strains of HPV are classified into high- and low-risk categories based on their cancer risks.2 Oncogenic strains of HPV (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, and 59) are responsible for many anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers and account for nearly 100% of cervical cancers, with the most common high-risk strain being HPV16 and HPV18.3 Specimen obtained from the cervix via a spatula or cervical brush are obtained for primary HPV testing or co-testing with cytology. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 2 tests for primary testing and 5 tests for co-testing and reflex testing in the case of positive cell change observed on cytology. These samples have traditionally been obtained by health care professionals. Though there are slight differences in HPV subtypes that are screened for depending on the specific test, all tests include the 13 high-risk HPV strains. A positive result leads to genotyping of the HPV sample for the most oncogenic strains (HPV 16 and 18). Some tests also include high-risk HPV type 45.8
Since the introduction of HPV and cytology screening of the cervix, mortality from cervical cancer has drastically decreased.  It is estimated that routine cervical cancer screenings are associated with the reduction of 105,000 to 492,000 cases of cervical cancer in the last 30 years.9
The latest recommendations on HPV screening from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), The American Cancer Society (ACS), and The US Preventative Services Taskforce (USPSTF) reflect a better understanding of the natural history of high-risk HPV and advise practitioners to include high-risk HPV testing in the screening process and to screen less frequently.10 It is important to note that these guidelines apply to all individuals who have a cervix. The USPSTF recommendations are summarized in Table 2.10
TM individuals, with masculine spectrum gender identity and assigned female sex at birth, have disproportionately benefitted less from this screening compared with individuals who identify as cisgender. Over 80% of TM individuals have not undergone gender affirming surgery that involves the removal of the cervix. These individuals are at the same risk of cervical cancer as their cisgender counterparts and should undergo regular cervical cancer screening.11 However, TM individuals are 37% less likely to have ever had screening for cervical cancer in their lifetime than cisgender individuals. In addition, 56% of TM individuals have received regular screening compared with 72% of cisgender women (Table 3).12
Table 3. Rates of Regular Cervical Cancer Screening Among Transmasculine (TM) Individuals Compared With Cisgender Women.12
Potential financial, physiologic, and psychological factors may deter TM individuals from participating in HPV screening, including fear of discrimination or concern that health care providers may not know how to properly medically serve those who are not cisgender women. In addition, genital exams that are traditionally a part of a gynecologic exam involve recognition of anatomy that is noncongruent with individuals’ gender identity.13 This could lead to new or heightened gender dysphoria or body dysmorphia.
Not all TM individuals are prescribed hormones, however, those who are taking testosterone may experience greater discomfort or pain during a gynecologic exam. Increased circulating androgens may cause vaginal and cervical tissue atrophy leading to an uncomfortable or painful traditional screening. Androgen-mediated changes to cervical cytology may also affect pathologists’ ability to interpret the cytology.13
Higher rates of unemployment and lower rates of insurance are additional barriers to receiving guideline-recommended health screenings.1 TM individuals experience a coverage denial or other barrier to care at 25%, and while 11% of adults in the USA are uninsured, TM individuals reported a rate of 14%.14
Primary testing of HPV for cervical cancer screening is a technique that may open up care opportunities to TM individuals. An emerging method for HPV testing is a patient-collected swab of the cervicovaginal area. A private, accurate screening for HPV may allow those who are averse to traditional screening an opportunity to stay up to date on cervical cancer screening. A meta-analysis reviewed 36 studies that evaluated the accuracy of HPV self-testing versus clinician-collected samples. The analysis included 23,328 individuals. Concordance between detection of HPV via self-swab and clinician-acquired swab ranged from 78.2% to 96.9%.15
A study published in 2021 also evaluated the efficacy of cervicovaginal self-sampling vs clinician-acquired HPV testing and included 505 participants. Each participant underwent a self-swab and a traditional screening test from a clinician in random order. The samples were evaluated for HPV-DNA, with a prevalence of 22.8% in the self-collected samples and 19.2% in the traditionally obtained samples. The concordance rate between the 2 methods was 78.2%. Considering the fair agreement between the results of the self-swab and clinician-collected samples, self-collected HPV screening offers people with a cervix an opportunity to receive the guideline recommended cervical cancer screening in a private and more accessible way. This opens the door for TM individuals specifically to minimize the potential negative impact of a gynecologic exam while maximizing the availability of gender affirming health care.16
The screening rate among TM individuals for cervical cancer via primary HPV testing was evaluated in a longitudinal study by Goldstein, et al.17 The study evaluated the adherence of cervical cancer screening in the TM community before and after a primary high-risk HPV self-collected specimen method was implemented as a screening option. Before the availability of the self-sampling method, 25% of the participants agreed to clinician-performed cervical cancer screening. Comparatively, 51% of participants were willing to be screened via clinician or self-sampling at subsequent appointments given the option for the self-administered test. This case study demonstrated that compliance with national screening guidelines improves with the addition of self-collected samples for HPV testing as an option.17
In May 2024, the FDA approved collection kits for self-obtained HPV cervicovaginal swabs.18 All accepted tests were previously approved for clinician-acquired samples; however, their use has been officially extended to include self-swab options obtained in a health care setting. In an interview, the Chief Scientific Officer at the American Cancer Society suggested that as increasing information and evidence is gathered regarding approved self-swab methods, this option has the potential to integrate into regular clinic-based screenings for cervical cancer.19
In January 2024, the National Cancer Institute announced the launch of the Last Mile initiative, a nationwide trial to continue to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of patient- administered cervical HPV testing. Although the smaller trials discussed here contribute to the legitimacy of self-swabbing for cervical cancer screening, a nationwide, multifactorial study is needed to potentially integrate the evidence into national screening guidelines.19
Primary care providers must educate all people with a cervix about the importance of HPV infection screening. Self-collected HPV cervicovaginal screening is an effective alternative and offers an option to patients who may be harmed by physician-collected testing or defer traditional cervical cancer screening. Increased screening of underserved communities, such as the TM community, by self-testing provides a private screening that yields accurate results and leads individuals who test positive on a path to treatment. Compassionate gender-affirming care will continue to bolster the relationship between patient and provider and allow for further education and health benefits to all patients.","Sydney Ver Steeg, PA-C; Amber Casado, MPA, PA-C"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/brain-inflammation-reason-behind-muscle-fatigue-after-infection-injury/,Brain Inflammation May Be Reason Behind Muscle Fatigue After Infection and Injury,"Infectious or chronic diseases such as long COVID, Alzheimer’s disease and traumatic brain injury can cause inflammation in the brain, or neuroinflammation, that weakens muscles. While scientists are aware of this link between inflammation and muscle weakness, the molecules and processes involved have been unclear.
In our research, our team of neuroscientists and biologists uncovered the hidden conversation between the brain and muscles that triggers muscle fatigue, and potential ways to treat it.
Neuroinflammation results when your central nervous system – the brain and spine – activates its own immune system to protect itself against infection, toxins, neurodegeneration, and traumatic injury. Neuroinflammatory reactions primarily occur in the brain. But for unknown reasons, patients also experience many symptoms outside the central nervous system, such as debilitating fatigue and muscle pain.
To solve this puzzle, we studied brain inflammation in the context of three different diseases: bacterial infection in E. coli-induced meningitis; viral infection in COVID-19; and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease. Then, we analyzed how these immune changes affect muscle performance.
We measured immune changes in the brains of fruit flies and mice infected with live bacteria, viral proteins, or neurotoxic proteins. After the initial accumulation of toxic molecules in the brain that commonly increase in response to stresses such as infection, the brain produces high levels of cytokines – chemicals that activate the immune system – that are released into the body. When these cytokines travel to muscles, they activate a series of chemical reactions that disrupt the ability of the powerhouse of cells – mitochondria – to produce energy.
Though the result of these immune changes doesn’t seem to damage muscle fibers, it does cause fatigue. When we measured the muscle performance of these animals after giving them treatments to offset the effects of immune activation, we found that both flies and mice moved significantly less in response to manual or mechanical stimuli compared with those that were not infected. This indicated that the animals had reduced endurance.
Our findings suggest that the muscle fatigue that results from infection or chronic illness is caused by a brain-to-muscle communication pathway that depletes energy in muscles without disrupting their structure or integrity. Unlike traditional explanations for muscle dysfunction that focus on causes outside the brain, such as damage to the muscle fibers, this pathway directly causes fatigue.
Since the key cytokine involved in brain-to-muscle communication has been preserved throughout evolution across different species, we believe this signaling pathway could represent a universal mechanism the brain uses to claim and reallocate energy to fight against infection. https://www.youtube.com/embed/TAqO0Mq19JQ?wmode=transparent&start=0 Cytokines are signaling proteins that help cells communicate with each other.
Since we studied the brain-muscle axis only in the context of simplified models, we don’t know whether it applies to more complex conditions such as fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. We also don’t know how impaired energy production in muscles correlates with impaired energy production in the brain.
Furthermore, the brain-muscle axis works through a series of interconnected steps. But the precise mechanism of this communication and the potential involvement of other cytokines are unknown.
Muscle weakness and fatigue are common symptoms in multiple diseases, ranging from bacterial and viral infections to chronic disorders and neurodegenerative conditions. These symptoms are distressing and reduce the quality of life of millions of people worldwide.
For instance, most of the 65 million people around the world struggling with long COVID experience disabling fatigue lasting from months to years.
Similarly, reduced muscle strength is a common symptom of early stage Alzheimer’s disease, a condition that affects at least 50 million people globally.
Better understanding of how neuroinflammation causes muscle fatigue can lead to potential treatments that improve muscle function.
Our work suggests that targeting the brain-muscle axis could offer new treatment strategies for muscle fatigue.
Currently, we are testing neutralizing antibodies – proteins that bind to and inhibit the function of cytokines – in mice with neuroinflammation. These FDA-approved treatments specifically target cytokines secreted by the brain and prevent signaling to muscle. We are interested in identifying which neutralizing antibodies, or combinations of antibodies, prevent muscle fatigue in mice.
We are also planning a long COVID clinical trial to profile cytokine levels in patients. It is unclear whether other COVID-19 proteins can also trigger neuroinflammation and muscle fatigue. Recent evidence suggests that long COVID may be linked to lingering viral particles in several organs, including the brain, even months after infection. However, it is uncertain whether and how this might be connected with the high levels of cytokines seen in long COVID.
With further development, targeting the brain-muscle axis could be a useful treatment for people suffering with long COVID and other diseases that cause brain inflammation.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/text-based-breastfeeding-education/,Can Weekly Text-Based Breastfeeding Education Affect Breastfeeding Initiation Among Black Women?,"Breastmilk is considered the best source of nutrition for most babies.1 The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that mothers exclusively breastfeed for the first 6 months of life, followed by continued breastfeeding as complementary foods are introduced for 1 year or longer, as mutually desired by the mother and infant.2 Breastfeeding benefits for both mother and baby include lowering the risk of asthma, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), ear infections, obesity, diabetes, and stomach ailments.1 Mothers who breastfeed have a reduced risk of developing ovarian and breast cancer, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes.1
Despite the recommendations and known benefits of breastfeeding, Black women have the lowest breastfeeding rates of all racial and ethnic groups. According to breastfeeding surveillance in the US, Black women are 2.5 times less likely to breast feed than White women.3 Breastfeeding initiation rates, exclusivity, and duration show a 10% to 20% decrease in Black infants compared with White infants.4 In a commentary,  Amani Echols from the National Partnership for Women and Families, reported that breastfeeding initiation is 69.4% among Black women compared with 85.9% of White women, and 83.2% of women overall. The percentage of Black women breastfeeding at 6 months is 44.7% compared with 62% of White women and 57.6% of women overall.5 Black mothers are the most likely to provide formula supplementation on day 2 of life than any other minority group.5
Black mothers are faced with a disproportionate number of barriers to breastfeeding compared to other racial and ethnic groups.4,6 (Table)
Table. Barriers to Breastfeeding for Black Mothers
Additional barriers include income disparities between Black and White women. The percentage of Black women living below the poverty level is significantly higher than White women (< 100% of the poverty level: 49.3% vs 17.8%). Compared with White women, Black women are more likely to receive Special Supplemental Nutrition (78.2% vs 34.1%) and to be unmarried (65.5% vs. 23.9%), all of which leads to decreased breastfeeding among Black women.4 These rates also indicate that breastfeeding initiation among Black women is less than that of different ethnic groups.4
The potential consequences of lower breastfeeding rates among Black women are especially concerning because their children experience health disparities in most conditions for which breastfeeding is protective.7 Black babies are at an increased risk of chronic health conditions, childhood morbidities, infant mortality, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).8 Breastmilk provides antibodies and essential nutrients that strengthen an infant’s immune system, reducing the risk for infections, respiratory conditions and gastrointestinal disease. This is one factor contributing to higher rates of asthma, ear infections and respiratory infections. Black infants in the US also have an infant mortality rate that is more than twice that of White infants.
To address these disparities, culturally sensitive interventions targeting Black women need to be developed and evaluated, and those that are effective, disseminated widely.7 The following research question was used to guide this quality improvement intervention: Will receipt of 10 weeks of breastfeeding education delivered via text messages, starting between gestational ages 26 and 32 weeks, affect breastfeeding initiation and duration rates among Black women?
This small pilot study used a quantitative, quasi-experimental design utilizing a one-group pretest-posttest design method.9 Internal review board (IRB) approval was obtained by Thomas Jefferson University’s Institutional Review Board.
Cayaba Care is a maternal support program that offers a full range of support to high-risk people of color living in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Its workforce comprises of obstetricians, women’s health nurse practitioners (WHNP), nurses (RN), lactation consultants, registered dieticians, doulas, and maternity navigators who provide virtual and in-home patient visits.
Inclusion criteria included Black mothers who had an email address and access to a smartphone, were over 18 years of age, and had no diagnosed mental health concerns. Mothers were excluded from the study if they were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) postpartum or their infants were admitted to the neonatal (ICU).10 Contraindications to breastfeeding were defined as mothers diagnosed with HIV, suspected or confirmed Ebola virus disease, using illicit street drugs and not enrolled in a methadone program, mothers infected with T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 or type 2, and infants diagnosed with galactosemia.11
Mothers who met the eligibility criteria were referred to this study. Informed consent was obtained by the primary investigator. Expecting mothers’ information was embedded in the electronic medical records to alert the primary investigator when the child was delivered.
This study used a text-based platform called Welkin to deliver breastfeeding education, consent, surveys, and links for demographic information and eligibility criteria. Welkin is a HIPAA-compliant communication platform used to send text messages and emails to patients. There was no additional cost to the patient to use this platform, which was actively used at Cayaba Care. Ten pregnant mothers who were over 18 years of age and self-identified as Black were enrolled in this study. Once consent was obtained, participants received a 10-question pre-test survey to complete before beginning the study. Participants then received breastfeeding education text messages every Monday for 10 weeks, including:
The independent variable was weekly text-based breastfeeding education, which was texted directly to the patient between the gestational ages of 26 and 32 weeks. Text-based breastfeeding education was initiated between 26 and 32 weeks to ensure participants ideally had most of the breastfeeding education covered by the time they gave birth. The dependent variable was the breastfeeding initiation duration rates among Black women. Breastfeeding initiation was assessed via a text message sent 1 week postpartum. At the 2-week telehealth postpartum visit, participants received a post-test survey to be completed on their smartphones or during their visit. Breastfeeding for this study was defined as feeding the baby breast milk directly from the breast, pumped breast milk, or hand-expressed breast milk.
Descriptive statistics were used to report the study’s outcomes and determine our intervention’s clinical significance, including ratio levels of measurements, means, and standard deviations. SPSS was used to conduct the statistical analysis. This study sought to determine if there is a significant difference in breastfeeding initiation in our intervention group by analyzing the pre-test and post-test scores using a dependent t-test or paired t-test.
This study consisted of 10 women (N=10) identified as Black who were between 26 to 32 weeks pregnant upon enrollment in the study, with due dates ranging from 2/1/23 to 3/23/23. Of the participants, 80% (n=8) had no breastfeeding experience. The mean age of enrolled participants was 28 years (range 18-49 years); 70% (n=7) of these women were between the ages of 18 to 28 years old, 20% (n=2) were between the ages of 29 to 39 years old, and 10% (n=1) were between the ages of 40 to 49 years old. None of the women in this study had any previously diagnosed mental health disorders or contraindications to breastfeeding.
Seventy percent (n=7) of the participants planned to breastfeed coming into this study, 30% (n=3) intended to breastfeed and formula feed at the beginning of this study, and 0% (n=0) of these women indicated a plan to exclusively formula feed. At the beginning of this study, 70% (n=7) of these women believed breastfeeding is the best way to feed the baby, 10% (n=1) believed a mixture of both breast and formula feeding is the best way to feed a baby, and 20% (n=2) of the women felt that breastfeeding and formula feeding were equally good ways to feed a baby (SD=1.19).
Post-delivery data showed that 100% of study participants were breastfeeding at both 1 week and 2 weeks post-delivery. For both weeks, 40% (n=4) of participants were exclusively breastfeeding, 60% (n=6) breastfed and fed formula, and none of the mothers fed formula only. A McNemar test and Binomial distribution were used to compare how the participants initially thought they were going to feed their babies and how they were feeding their babies at two weeks postpartum. The statistical analysis was insignificant (P = .375) and showed no significant change in their response.
At 2 weeks post-delivery, the data showed that 80% (n=8) of the mothers planned to breastfeed for 6 months or more, and 20% (n=2) indicated they would breastfeed as long as possible. Based on the results of the post-intervention survey, 90% (n=9) of the mothers liked receiving breastfeeding text messages, and most of the mothers 90% (n=9) liked the messaging and graphics used in the lessons. However, less than half of 40% (n=4) felt the breastfeeding text messages influenced their decision to breastfeed or formula feed.
This original research aimed to determine if text-based breastfeeding education would affect breastfeeding initiation rates among Black women. According to the preliminary results, text-based breastfeeding education did not significantly influence the mother’s decision to initiate breastfeeding. However, data from this study indicated that all of the mothers initiated breastfeeding after delivery (40% breast only and 60% breast and formula) and continued breastfeeding at their 2-week postpartum visit.
These results suggest that the intervention influenced how participants chose to feed their babies. The majority of participants reported receiving text-based breastfeeding education directly to their phones, indicating that this was an effective method of delivering breastfeeding education. This intervention was tested in a cohort of women with a pre-existing desire to breastfeed. The education was intended to help reinforce the mother’s pre-existing knowledge that breastfeeding is best for both mother and infant. It also aligned with the mother’s initial value. Based on the presurvey data collected, it was indicated that all the participants supported breastfeeding. Therefore, for some, the intervention may not have had as much influence on the decision to initiate breastfeeding. However, for others, the data suggests that it may have. This was reflected by 40% of the participants indicating that the intervention influenced their decision to use this feeding method. Since all participants indicated a desire to breastfeed for 6 months or longer, according to post-survey results, this intervention may have also influenced the decision of how long to breastfeed.
Another interesting finding according to the pre-intervention survey is that 70% of the mothers planned to breastfeed exclusively, and only 30% planned to breastfeed and formula-feed their babies. By 2 weeks post-delivery, 40% of participants reported solely breastfeeding, and 60% reported breast and formula-feeding their infants. Reasons for this change included concerns about infant weight and nutrition, issues with latching, and nothing associated with the education received.
These results are consistent with the literature review completed for this research, indicating that educational and telecommunication interventions effectively improve breastfeeding initiation and duration among Black mothers. The results indicate that most mothers liked receiving text-based breastfeeding education, which suggests this is an effective educational delivery method. Also, this intervention may have influenced the duration of breastfeeding. No significant data supports this assertion; however, according to week two’s post-delivery survey results, all the mothers in this study planned to breastfeed for 6 months or more. This is an improvement from the current literature that suggests that Black women breastfeed for short durations and often stop breastfeeding by 2 weeks postpartum.12 Data from this research indicated that at 2 weeks postpartum, all the study participants continued giving breast milk to their infants through exclusive breastfeeding or breast and formula feeding.
Limitations of this study included having a small sample size, all participants reporting a desire to breastfeed, and the need for more time to complete the survey due to IRB delays.
The impact of the intervention could have been more significant if the mothers had received more text messages for an extended period versus the 10 weeks approved by IRB.13 Lastly, only some studies have used text-based interventions to improve breastfeeding initiation outcomes, leading to limited background research supporting this intervention, particularly regarding telecommunications intervention.
According to the Center for Academic Innovation at the University of Michigan, breastfeeding disparities must be considered a public health issue.14 The potential consequences of lower breastfeeding rates among Black women are especially concerning because their children experience health disparities in most conditions for which breastfeeding is protective.7 Data from this study indicated that a text-based breastfeeding intervention could affect breastfeeding knowledge and perception, improving breastfeeding duration and initiation for all, especially Black mothers and their babies. Using mobile phone technologies provided an opportunity to broadly and cheaply offer an affordable, proximal, personalized, and customized means of influencing breastfeeding behaviors.13
Although this text-based breastfeeding education intervention did not significantly impact breastfeeding initiation among Black women due to the participants’ pre-existing intentions, the participants in this study were receptive to this intervention. They reported enjoying receiving breastfeeding education through text messaging. Also, when asked post-intervention, all participants reported they desired to breastfeed for 6 months or more. Therefore, data from this study indicates that this intervention should be considered a helpful measure worth implementing to improve breastfeeding initiation and sustaining rates for Black mothers.15","Renee Wynn, DNP, CRNP, WHNP-BC"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/nurses-with-disabilties-support/,Nursing Can Do Better: How to Support Nurses With Disabilities in the US Health Care System,"Nurses constitute the largest group of health care professionals in the US, and the demand for nurses to join the workforce has consistently increased.1,2 While the nursing profession promotes health and well-being, health care systems frequently neglect the needs of its workers, especially those with disabilities.
Health care workers with disabilities face significant challenges, such as employment discrimination, lack of accessibility, and interpersonal ableism. According to the 2024 US census, approximately 13.4% of the US population lives with a disability, underscoring the importance of raising awareness to reduce barriers.3 These perspectives were further examined at the “We Belong Here—Disability Advocacy in Nursing” Equity Panel hosted at the DNPs of Color annual conference, held in Philadelphia, PA, October 17-20, 2024.
Andrea Dalzell, MSN-ed, BS, RN, also known as the Seated Nurse, is the first registered nurse to complete nursing school using a wheelchair in New York State. In this panel, Ms Dalzell discusses her perspective as someone with an apparent disability, while Sabrina Jamal-Eddine, PhD, RN, discusses barriers of navigating the health care space with a non-apparent disability. Dr Jamal-Eddine is a disabled nurse scientist who researches ableism in nursing education and practice. She speaks from her lived experience of navigating undergraduate and graduate nursing education with a permanent physical disability related to a connective tissue disorder and having undergone multiple 12-level posterior spinal fusions.
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was enacted in 1990, prohibiting discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, transportation, public accommodations, state and local government services, and telecommunications.4,5
Title I of the ADA prohibits private businesses, educational institutions, employment agencies, labor organizations, and state and local government entities with 15 or more employees from discriminating against individuals with disabilities. This section of the ADA also requires that employers provide reasonable accommodation to employees with disabilities.6
Title II of the ADA protects the rights of people with disabilities from discrimination in state and local government services, programs, and activities. This section pertains to all state and local government entities, regardless of the number of people employed.2
In addition to the ADA, other important laws that protect individuals with disabilities in employment processes include the Rehabilitation Act, Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act, and Civil Service Reform Act.2
While many laws exist to protect the rights of people with disabilities in all employment-related processes, significant barriers continue to persist.
Somewhere down the line, disability now is synonymous with unhealthy disability. It leads to questions like – How do you do CPR? How do you ambulate a patient?

Ms Dalzell, who has used a wheelchair since the age of 12, was inspired to pursue nursing after noticing a lack of representation of nurses with disabilities, despite being in the care of a wide range of nurses throughout her life. Although nursing has been a growing profession, Ms Dalzell received 76 rejections from nursing positions, while her peers did not face issues gaining employment.
“Somewhere down the line, disability now is synonymous with unhealthy disability. It leads to questions like – How do you do CPR? How do you ambulate a patient?” Ms Dalzell said.
Ms Dalzell persevered through these obstacles and ultimately achieved her goal of working as a nurse at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, where the governor had urgently called on all nurses for support. Through her experiences as a patient and her professional training, Ms Dalzell was able to guide and support other nurses in areas where her unique perspective proved invaluable. “There’s so much we don’t learn that people living with disabilities know more than anyone else,” Ms Dalzell said.
While people with apparent disabilities face many upfront barriers to employment, those with non-apparent disabilities face other unique obstacles. Dr Jamal-Eddine remarked, “People don’t view me as a disabled person. It’s a coming out process where you constantly have to prove that you are disabled, that you still belong in nursing, and that you are no more of a liability than anyone else.”
Title I of the ADA prohibits employers from asking job applicants about the “existence, nature, or severity of a disability,” placing the responsibility on individuals to disclose their disabilities in order to receive accommodations.6
However, Dr Jamal-Eddine highlighted the need for a more collaborative effort within the health care system to create accessible spaces for people with disabilities. Health care systems should automatically incorporate certain accommodations to ensure accessibility. For example, facilities should be intentionally designed with enough space for wheelchairs and hospitals should invest in equipment like ramps and adjustable chairs. “If you’re accommodating for disabled nurses, you’re going to build in accessibility for disabled patients as well,” Dr Jamal-Eddine said. This approach would alleviate the burden on nurses to disclose certain disabilities to receive necessary support.
“A lot of it is just about innovating,” said Dr Jamal-Eddine, “It takes time, it takes energy, and it takes money, but we are entitled to accommodations like anyone in any other job is.”
Dr Jamal-Eddine explains that it is essential to understand the differences between disability rights and disability justice to be an effective advocate for individuals with disabilities. While disability rights are in place to protect individuals with disabilities in all stages of the employment process, laws are not always practiced and many marginalized groups within the disability community face barriers to equity.
If you’re accommodating for disabled nurses, you’re going to build in accessibility for disabled patients as well.

“They expect you to file a lawsuit if you experience ableism in nursing education,” said Dr Jamal-Eddine, “But who is economically privileged enough to file the lawsuit? Usually not poor people of color. So that’s why people are not making it through and are experiencing multiple barriers.”
Moreover, filing a complaint within the health care system can jeopardize future career opportunities. “You’re blackballing yourself, but opening the door for the next person,” Ms Dalzell said.
Disability rights typically benefit privileged groups and tend to neglect marginalized individuals within this space. Disability justice, however, is a movement that views this issue through an intersectional lens, aiming to secure rights for all people with disabilities.7

“You can’t only depend on law to create change,” said Dr Jamal-Eddine, “You need to teach people that disabled humans matter. Disability Matters. We are valuable people.”
Health care providers play an integral role in diagnosing and caring for patients with disabilities, making them responsible for determining who is qualified to receive certain services.
“Disability is something that is placed under the jurisdiction of medicine,” Dr Jamal-Eddine said. “Doctors and nurses become the gatekeepers of disability and decide who has access to the social services, assistive devices, and accommodations we need to survive.” Consequently, health care providers must receive comprehensive education on caring for patients with disabilities.
Both panelists acknowledge a lack of didactic education and clinical training in nursing programs on caring for patients with disabilities. Additionally, the US Surgeon General and World Health Organization (WHO) have advocated for increased training on disability for physicians.8,9 Despite this call to action, approximately half of US medical schools report having disability awareness as part of their curriculum.10
Increasing disability education for health care professionals can change perspectives and reduce biases against patients with disabilities. Dr Jamal-Eddine said that in her research she has found that many “health care providers automatically believe that disabled people have no quality of life – that disability is worse than death.”
Increased representation in the nursing workforce can also help shift the narrative for a patient’s understanding of disability. “How does the patient know that life goes on if there’s no representation?” Ms Dalzell said.
Ms Dalzell urged nurse educators to review their syllabi and foster a safe environment for students, rather than dismissing their needs. “Stop directing students to just go to their disability office,” she said. “Let them feel comfortable to come and speak to you… you’re allowing that person to decide how much trust they want to put into you, without feeling like it’s going to be used against them.”
Ms Dalzell also called on employers to “understand the difference between technical standards and a job description.” Many nursing programs list functional ability domains, requiring students to be able to lift 25 pounds, navigate confined spaces, and stand for extended periods. These requirements favor able-bodied individuals and limit nurses with disabilities from joining the workforce, despite being able to complete these tasks with reasonable accommodations.
Dr Jamal-Eddine asked that health care systems think of innovative solutions for nurses with disabilities, stating “We’re creative nonstop because we are constantly figuring out how to navigate a society that is not designed for us.” She also called on institutions to “trust disabled people – we’re not asking for things that we don’t need.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/ulcerative-colitis-statistics/,Ulcerative Colitis Statistics,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects the rectum and colon.1 It is a relapsing and remitting autoimmune disease characterized by rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and tenesmus.1,2 Ulcerative colitis is prevalent in Western countries, particularly in North America.2,3 However, due to the fragmented nature of the US health care system, accurately measuring the occurrence of UC is difficult, and few studies provide current UC statistics.3 This article summarizes available data on the prevalence, incidence, and distribution of UC in the US, and provides an overview of current treatments.
According to US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2009 to 2010, the estimated prevalence of IBD (UC or Crohn’s disease) was 1.2% of the US population, or 2.3 million people.4 The prevalence of UC was 1%, or 1.9 million people.4
These NHANES estimates are based on patient self-report of being diagnosed with an IBD (UC or Crohn’s disease).4 In a 2023 study, Lewis et al used US public and private medical insurance claims to estimate the incidence, prevalence, and ethnic distribution of IBD.3 They found that IBD affects an estimated 0.7% of the US population, or approximately 2.39 million people. Of those, an estimated 1.253 million people were diagnosed with UC.3
In North America, the annual incidence of UC is approximately 15 cases per 1000,000 people.2
Ulcerative colitis is caused by a complex interaction between genes and the environment that results in an abnormal immune-mediated response to the gut microbiome in a genetically susceptible person.2 More than 200 genes have been associated with UC.2 Genetics accounts for an estimated one-fourth of the heritability of UC.5
Certain environmental factors may affect the incidence of UC by influencing the gut microbiome. Environmental factors that might increase the risk for UC include the following5:
Ulcerative colitis is most commonly diagnosed in people in their 20s.3 Most studies show a greater incidence and prevalence of UC compared with Crohn’s disease.3,6 However, compared with Crohn’s disease, UC is less common in pediatric patients.3
Most incidence and prevalence studies for UC show males and females are equally likely to develop UC.4
Lewis et al found the prevalence of IBD varied in different racial and ethnic groups in the US.3 They found patients who are White have the highest prevalence of IBD: 812 cases per 100,000 people. In other races and ethnicities, the prevalence of IBD per 100,000 people was estimated to be 504 in those who are Black, 458 in people who are Hispanic, and 403 in individuals who are Asian. In all racial and ethnic groups, UC is more common than Crohn’s disease.3
The prevalence of UC differs based on geographic location. In the US, it is slightly more common in the Northeast, and equally common in the Midwest, South, and West.3
Ulcerative colitis typically causes substantial morbidity but has a low mortality rate.1 It can adversely affect many aspects of a patient’s quality of life, including impaired social interactions and career advancement.1,7 Patients with UC may experience depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue, and sleep disorders.7 Additionally, chronic inflammation caused by UC can increase the risk of colorectal cancer.1
The mortality rate of patients with UC generally does not differ from that of the general population.8 The 12-month mortality rate in patients with acute, severe UC is approximately 1%.9 Ulcerative colitis mortality rates are higher in the first few years after diagnosis and in patients with severe disease or advanced age.8,9
In the past, colectomy was a primary treatment for people with severe UC, but in recent years it has been used less often. In a 2016 study, Clemente et al found that between 1976 and 1980, almost 65% of patients with severe UC received a colectomy.10 However, according to a 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis that included 31 studies from 1985 to 2021 with a total of 294,359 patients, the rate of colectomy at 10 years after receiving a diagnosis of UC had fallen to approximately 10%.11
The introduction of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants as treatments for UC seems to have had a substantial impact on reducing morbidity and mortality.10,11
According to the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) clinical guidelines for ulcerative colitis, UC treatments are categorized as induction therapies and maintenance therapies.1 Induction therapies focus on restoring normal bowel function, while maintenance therapies help maintain symptom remission.
The choice of induction therapy depends on the severity of the disease. Options include rectal or oral 5-aminosalicylate, oral budesonide, and systemic corticosteroids.1 Although systemic corticosteroids are effective for inducing remission, they are associated with several serious short- and long-term adverse effects, such as immunosuppression, bone fractures, and osteoporosis.1,12 Additionally, heavy corticosteroid use is associated with an increased risk of resective surgery in patients with IBD.13 For these reasons, systemic corticosteroids are generally recommended only for patients with treatment-refractory mild to moderate UC, or those with severe UC.1
Despite the risks associated corticosteroids and availability of newer effective treatments — such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) drugs — corticosteroids are commonly used to treat UC.1,12 A 204 study found that approximately 63% of patients with IBD were prescribed corticosteroids within 10 years of their diagnosis.13 However, the use of corticosteroids to treat IBD seem to be decreasing. A retrospective study that evaluated 386 patients with IBD found that prednisolone prescriptions decreased from 2006 to 2023.12
According to the ACG guidelines, maintenance of corticosteroid-free remission is a goal of UC treatment.1 For some patients, steroid-free remission can be achieved with treatments such as 5-aminosalicylate, anti-TNF therapy, and the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor tofacitinib.1 However, for many patients, UC treatments are inadequate. Recent studies in the United Kingdom (UK) and Germany found that approximately one-half of patients with UC do not achieve remission within 1 year.14,15

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/pa-sues-employer-wrongful-termination/,PA Sues Employer for Wrongful Termination,"In June 1998, Ms B signed a contract to work as a physician associate (PA) for a physicians’ group. Her contract specified that she agreed to work full time, on a salary, and for a specific hospital. However, over the next 10 years, Ms B became a part-time employee, on an hourly wage, and for multiple facilities on behalf of the physicians’ group.
In January 2020, Ms B signed a collaborative agreement with the physicians’ group, which provided the specific tasks and procedures that Ms B was allowed to conduct under the supervision of her collaborating physician. In November of that year, during the COVID pandemic, Ms B stopped submitting for any shifts.
In January 2021, Ms B contacted the president of the group, Dr P, about the use of ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, for the treatment of patients with COVID. Dr P responded in part by telling Ms B that it “was not recommended” to proceed with ivermectin as a COVID treatment, but that he would continue to monitor the studies on the medication.
At the end of the month, Dr P sent an email to all physicians and PAs in the group alerting them about a possible case of ivermectin toxicity and advising medical staff that prescribing the agent would be considered malpractice. The following day Ms B responded to Dr P’s email. In her email, she questioned the alleged ivermectin toxicity and suggested that the issue could have been caused by a wrong dosage rather than the drug itself. Dr P responded via email to Ms B, reminding her that “the point was that it is malpractice to prescribe ivermectin for COVID.”
The next day, Ms B received an email from human resources. It said: “As we look ahead [to the new year] and the continuing decrease in available hours, it makes sense for a formal separation at this time. I see you haven’t worked since early November and are not on the schedule at all for [the coming year].” The email included a 90-day termination notice. At the end of April, Ms B’s employment with PEG ended.
In August, after seeking counsel from an attorney, Ms B filed a complaint against the practice alleging wrongful termination and breach of contract. The complaint provided the June 1998 contract as the employment agreement. The wrongful termination claim was based on the premise that Ms B had been fired for sending the reply email to Dr P, contesting the ivermectin toxicity.
The physicians’ group filed a motion for summary judgment asking that the case against it be dismissed. The court held a hearing on the motion and ultimately concluded that Ms B was an at-will employee when she was terminated and her termination was valid. The court dismissed the case. Ms B appealed.
On appeal, Ms B argued that the trial court had incorrectly dismissed her case for wrongful termination. She said she was not, in fact, an at-will employee because she had a contract with the physicians’ group. The appeals court noted the 2 types of employment recognized by the state: employment for a definite or ascertainable term and employment at will. Under the doctrine of at-will employment, either party can end the employment relationship at any time for any reason.
The physicians’ group acknowledged that Ms. B had signed an employment contract over 20 years earlier but argued that the contract had been abandoned by both parties long ago.
The appeals court noted that per the 1998 contract, Ms B would be a full-time, salaried employee at one hospital. However, within 10 years of signing the contract, Ms B was working part-time, being paid hourly, and was working for different hospitals other than the one for which she had been hired. The court pointed out that for over a decade, Ms B and the physicians’ group had continued an employment relationship that was inconsistent with the material terms of the 1998 contract. Thus, the appeals court agreed with the lower court that both parties had abandoned the contract and Ms B was an at-will employee who could be terminated at any time.
Ms B then attempted a public policy argument, claiming that she was fired for her reply email to Dr P regarding ivermectin. The appeals court noted that the public policy exception was created to protect an employee from being discharged solely for exercising a statutorily conferred right. However, the court noted that Ms B claimed that she was ‘obeying her duties to collaborate with physicians, exercise reasonable care, and follow ethical standards’ – none of which are statutorily conferred rights.
Ultimately, the appeals court held that Ms B was an at-will employee and her email  was not “an expression of a statutorily conferred right or duty protected under public policy.” The appeals court agreed with the lower court and dismissed the case.
There is a good lesson to be learned from this case. An employment contract can be considered ‘abandoned’ if both parties continue a relationship inconsistent with the material terms of the contract. In this case, the court will generally conclude that the “parties acquiesced to the abandonment of the employment contract.”
If you are an at-will employee, be aware that your employment could be terminated at any time, for any reason. If you have an employment contract, make sure it is periodically reviewed and updated, and that both you and your employer are acting within the scope of your contract. If things change – for example, your employer wants you to take on an expanded role –update your contract to reflect this.","Ann W. Latner, JD"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/intracerebral-hemorrhage-secondary-to-chronic-untreated-hypertension/,Intracerebral Hemorrhage Secondary to Chronic Untreated Hypertension,"A 47-year-old man is brought to the emergency department (ED) with left-sided weakness after collapsing at work. According to his family, the patient appeared normal before leaving for work that morning. He is employed as a logger, which consists of long days and high physical demand. At previous ED visits, the patient had been told that his blood pressure was elevated. However, he had not followed up with a primary care provider and was not taking any prescribed medication. He did report taking ibuprofen frequently over the years for headaches, which have been occurring more often within the last year.
The patient has a longstanding history of alcohol use and smoking, consuming an average of 2 cases of beer and smoking half a pack of cigarettes per week for the last 10 years. His family history includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke including the death of his father from a heart attack at age 37 years and his maternal grandfather’s death from an unspecified stroke at age 54 years.
Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient’s blood pressure (BP) is 270/200 mm Hg. His initial presentation reveals left-sided weakness and a bitemporal headache that he rates 5 out of 5 in severity, describing it as “pressure-like.” His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is a 14. He is alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The patient’s speech and language are intact and he can follow both simple and complex commands. His pupils are equal (3-2 mm), round, and reactive to light and his extraocular movements are intact. His facial movements are asymmetric with a left-sided droop. The patient’s muscle strength and tone on the left upper extremity and left lower extremity are scored 1 out of 5. He has decreased sensation to light touch and pin prick on the left upper extremity and left lower extremity. His reflexes are 2+ throughout, and his finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests are within normal limits on the right but not testable on the left.
The patient’s initial National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) total score is 11, which represents a “moderate stroke.” (Figure 1)
The breakdown of his score is:
A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head reveals right thalamic hemorrhage with rupture into the lateral ventricles, third ventricle, and aqueduct of Sylvius. (Figure 2) CT angiography of the head is completed and there is no evidence of underlying vascular malformations or mass lesions. The patient is admitted to the neurologic intensive care unit (ICU) and placed on an intravenous (IV) nicardipine drip for a goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 160. Overnight, he becomes increasingly lethargic, disoriented, and unable to follow commands. Because of his worsening mental status, an external ventricular drain (EVD) is placed with an opening pressure of 30 mm Hg (normal, <15 mm Hg). It is set to drain at 5 mm Hg and is incrementally increased until he is able to be weaned off. The initial volume of the bleed is 15 mL to 20 mL. Repeat head CT scans following EVD placement reveal no significant changes in hemorrhage size and expansion. (Figure 3)

Initial laboratory test are taken and significant results are shown in the Table.
The patient’s coagulation studies are normal. A 2D transthoracic echo reveals normal ventricular structure and function, trace mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation, and minor pericardial effusion with an ejection fraction of 68%. There is no evidence of cardiac source of emboli identified as the cause of his stroke. A 12-lead EKG shows normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy, ST depression, and prolonged QT interval.
The patient spends 19 days in the neurology ICU, during which added complications arise. He develops bilateral lower lobe pneumonia attributed to aspiration and is treated with empiric antibiotics. He is intubated due to worsening hypoxemia and then extubated 4 days later, He recovers well on room oxygen.
The patient develops a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) around his peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The PICC line is removed, subcutaneous heparin is administered, and a compression device is placed. At the time of discharge, the patient is stable with left-sided hemiparesis and is referred to inpatient rehabilitation. Medications that are eventually added to the patient’s regimen include hydrochlorothiazide, hydralazine, metoprolol, amlodipine, and atorvastatin.
Figure 4 – Head CT prior to EVD removal; 5 days before discharge. There is expected evolution of a hyperdense right thalamic intraparenchymal hemorrhage with little surrounding edema and stable minimal right to left midline shift. Stable interventricular hemorrhage in the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle.
The clinical presentation of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is multidimensional because of its location, size, and extent of expansion. In contrast to ischemic strokes, where signs and symptoms are often maximal at onset, ICH signs and symptoms usually present gradually over minutes to hours.1 Common symptoms of thalamic hemorrhage include hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and sometimes transient homonymous hemianopsia.2 Upward gaze palsy with constricted, nonreactive pupils that are looking towards the weak side may also be present (this is opposite of the gaze deviation that occurs in hemispheric cortical insults).2 If the hemorrhage occurs in the dominant hemisphere, aphasia may be present.2  If the bleed affects the non-dominant hemisphere, neglect may be present.2
Differential diagnosis for spontaneous ICH includes cerebral amyloid angiopathy, neoplasms, arteriovenous malformations, coagulopathies and anticoagulation medications, ischemic strokes, and cerebral and venous sinus thrombosis.3
Imaging is necessary to distinguish ICH from ischemic stroke. Non-contrast CT is the gold-standard method of imaging for diagnosing ICH and can reveal the size of the hemorrhage, surrounding edema, increased intracranial pressure, mass effect, and intraventricular expansion.4 An acute ICH is seen on head CT scan as a hyperdense area inside the parenchyma with surrounding area that is hypodense.4 Computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are useful techniques in detecting any vascular pathologies that may have been a secondary cause of the ICH and have less than 90% sensitivity and specificity.5
Per the American Heart and Stroke Association guidelines, it is recommended to reduce the blood pressure to a systolic range of 130 to 140 mm Hg in patients who present with SPB ranges between 150 to 220 mm Hg.3 In patients who present with SBP more than 220 mm Hg, it is still necessary to lower blood pressure, however it should be done at a more controlled speed using an infusion with continuous monitoring in order to ensure that the patient can still maintain cerebral perfusion.4 To avoid hypotension, agents such as labetalol and nicardipine are preferred in treating elevated blood pressure due to their short half-life.6 Any anticoagulation that the patient may have been on should be reversed in addition to prompt BP management, and cessation.5
Expansion of the hematoma will occur in roughly one-third of ICH patients within the first 3 to 6 hours after onset of symptoms.7 Because of the morbidity and mortality associated with increasing hematoma size, prevention of the growth has become a main goal of early intervention,7 as well as minimizing the risk of a rebleed within the first 24 to 72 hours.4 In cases where intraventricular extension and hydrocephalus are of concern, cerebrospinal fluid diversion is the appropriate course of action. This is achieved with the insertion of an EVD, which allows for a decrease in intracranial pressure and reduces the risk of herniation.4 A decompressive craniotomy may be considered for patients that show no improvement with medical intervention to alleviate the mass effect that is caused by a large supratentorial ICH, though morbidity still remains high in these patients.4
Thalamic hemorrhages represent 8.3% to 15% of all intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs), falling second to those originating in the basal ganglia.8 The thalamus,  an area of gray matter that is within the diencephalon,  is comprised of multiple nuclei that have connections to the cortex, brainstem, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and spinal cord.8 Because of its anatomic location, thalamic bleeds often extend into the third ventricle.8 The major arteries that supply the thalamus include the posterior cerebral, basilar, and posterior communicant arteries.9 Most spontaneous hemorrhages are because of rupture of small blood vessels that have been damaged from chronic hypertension or amyloid angiopathy.8 Secondary causes of ICH are less common and are due to vascular abnormalities.8
Hypertension is the most common risk factor associated with thalamic hemorrhages, but advanced age, anticoagulation use, diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease, chronic renal failure, and alcohol consumption also increase the risk.9 Consciousness level at the beginning of the hemorrhage is a predictive factor for mortality, with the mortality rate of roughly 60% in patients who present with coma.9 Location of the bleed plays a major role in mortality as well; right-sided bleeds have been found to have more favorable outcomes.2 Additionally, lateral thalamic bleeds, which are the most common type, are more likely to be associated with intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalus.2 Male sex, low Glasgow Comma Scale on admission, clot volume greater than 20 mL to 30 mL, extension into the ventricles, and a need for ventriculostomy drainage are associated with poorer outcomes.2
The patient is seen at a 3-month follow-up visit, where he exhibits significant improvement. While he still has limited range of motion of his left arm due to spasticity and associated pain, his strength is markedly improved. He is ambulatory with a quad cane, and able to perform most of his activities of daily living.
At present, 9 years later, he is still using a walking cane for assistance and has residual left-sided spasticity. However, his strength has greatly increased, and he continues to exercise with a personal trainer weekly. The patient is proactive with his health, follows up regularly with his primary care provider, and is compliant with all medications. He checks his BP daily. He no longer drinks alcohol or smokes and has a healthier diet.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/celiac-disease-vs-gluten-intolerance/,Celiac Disease vs Gluten Intolerance: Understanding Autoimmunity and Sensitivity,"Our easy-to-read fact sheets provide clinicians with reliable information to share with patients and their caregivers.
Gluten is a type of protein present in grains like wheat, barley, and rye. It is commonly included in various foods to enhance the thickness, texture, and protein content.3
However, some individuals may face negative reactions and health issues when consuming gluten-containing foods. Peptides, the building blocks of gluten may be difficult to digest for some people, since they are not easily broken down by stomach acids.3
Approximately 1% of the global population has celiac disease (CeD), and its prevalence is expected to double every 2 decades.7 CeD is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten consumption. It is a permanent sensitivity that harms the small intestine and can affect other organs. In individuals with CeD, the body mistakenly attacks gluten as an offending agent, leading to inflammation and damage in the digestive tract.1
Certain risk factors increase the likelihood of developing CeD, including female sex, having a family history of the condition, and possessing specific genetic mutations in the HLA-DQ gene, which is associated with the immune response.1
For individuals with CeD, ongoing gluten consumption can damage the intestinal lining, impairing nutrient absorption. Therefore, it is crucial to limit or avoid gluten to manage the disease state. People with CeD also face higher risks of developing health issues like osteoporosis, arthritis, infertility, and anxiety.1
Gluten intolerance and CeD are distinct conditions. If you experience symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after consuming gluten but test negative for CeD, you might have gluten intolerance.4
This condition can affect anyone, but it is more common in women. Some individuals are born with gluten intolerance, while others may develop it later. Research suggests that around 6% of the US population may be affected.4
The exact reasons for gluten intolerance are not fully understood, but it often involves inflammation in the gut. Factors like changes in gut bacteria, increased sensitivity in the intestines, and previous stomach infections may play a role. Unlike CeD, gluten intolerance doesn’t cause damage to the intestines, but it can still lead to uncomfortable symptoms that affect daily life.4 Understanding these issues is an ongoing area of research.
Symptoms of CeD and gluten intolerance are relatively the same, including, but not limited to: diarrhea, excessive gas, unexplained weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies. However, CeD usually causes more intense symptoms and can lead to serious intestinal damage, along with other issues like fatigue and joint pain.5
Gluten intolerance, on the other hand, results in milder symptoms that do not cause lasting harm. The severity and pattern of symptoms can help differentiate between the 2 conditions, so keeping a food diary can be useful for tracking reactions.5
A simple blood test can diagnose CeD by checking for higher levels of specific antibodies in the blood. Screening is recommended for children aged over 3 years and adults who show symptoms of the condition, first-degree relatives of individuals with CeD, and people with autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes, thyroid issues, liver disease, Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, Williams syndrome, and selective IgA deficiency.2
There is not a definitive test for testing for gluten intolerance, but it can often be identified through an elimination diet. A health care provider may recommend removing gluten for at least 6 weeks while monitoring symptoms. If symptoms improve, gluten can be gradually reintroduced. If symptoms return, it may indicate gluten intolerance.4
The following are some, but not an exhaustive list, of foods that should be avoided if an individual has CeD or a gluten intolerance:3
An autoimmune reaction occurs when the immune system wrongly attacks the body’s own tissues, believing they are threats. In CeD, this happens when gluten is ingested, leading to harm in the intestines. On the contrary, gluten sensitivity means the body reacts poorly to gluten but does not cause permanent damage to the intestines. Although both conditions can cause unpleasant symptoms, an autoimmune reaction poses a greater risk and can result in lasting harm.2
The long-term consequences of CeD can involve continued harm to the intestines, leading to difficulties in absorbing nutrients. This may cause conditions like anemia, weak bones, and weight loss. Additionally, those who don’t manage their CeD properly might have an increased risk of developing other autoimmune disorders and health problems. Sticking to a strict gluten-free diet can help avoid these complications and support overall well-being.2
Yes, you can develop CeD later in life, even if you were previously symptom-free. There are many factors that can be the cause of CeD activation: changes in the body, stress, illness, or a family history. If you notice any new symptoms, it is important to discuss with a health care professional.2
For CeD: If you accidentally eat gluten and have CeD, monitor symptoms. Avoid more gluten and drink plenty of water to help your body recover. If symptoms are severe, contact your health care provider for advice on managing them.3
For gluten intolerance: Stop eating gluten and observe how you feel. Mild discomfort may go away on its own, but over-the-counter remedies such as Alka-seltzer can help with symptoms like bloating. If symptoms persist, consult a health care professional.4
Yes, it can be safe to eat processed foods labeled “gluten-free,” but it is essential to read the labels carefully. Some products may have traces of gluten due to manufactured cross-contamination. For people with CeD, even small amounts of gluten can cause serious issues, so choosing certified gluten-free products is best. If you have gluten intolerance, you should also be cautious, as some gluten-free foods might still trigger symptoms.6

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/national-diabetes-heart-connection-day/,Diabetes Heart Connection Day: Cardiology’s Role in Diabetes Care,"Since 2017, the United States has recognized Diabetes Heart Connection Day every November 9th during American Diabetes Month.1 This national initiative aims to raise awareness about the link between diabetes and heart disease, 2 leading causes of death and disability worldwide.2
Most physicians are well aware of the overlapping factors between these 2 conditions, including metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative damage. However, it’s helpful to review the dynamic interplay between diabetes and heart health, particularly regarding diabetes medications and cardiovascular outcomes. Here’s what you should know.
People with type 2 diabetes have double the risk of developing heart disease.1 This risk increases the longer someone has diabetes—a fact that’s particularly concerning given the younger age of type 2 diabetes onset in recent years.3,4 Over time, elevated blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels and nerves of the cardiovascular system.3 Around half of diabetes patients die from the complications of ischemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke, coronary artery disease, and peripheral artery disease.4
Hyperglycemia is associated with vascular complications. In addition, an excessive buildup of lipids in type 2 diabetes may produce insulin resistance in the heart muscle, along with fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction. Researchers have also noted the hazardous effects of hypoglycemia on the heart due to poor diabetes management.4
Efforts to avoid or delay new cases of heart disease in people with diabetes are critical to public health. Primary prevention includes healthy lifestyle recommendations and the monitoring and control of blood sugar, blood pressure, and lipids.4
The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology developed a risk stratification tool for primary prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes who don’t have heart disease. They’re also working on a risk stratification tool for secondary prevention.
Another screening method, the Risk Estimator Plus tool, allows physicians to calculate the 10-year risk of atherosclerosis in diabetes patients ages 40 to 79. This tool accounts for the following factors:
Before 2018, the focus of prevention was centered around glucose control. The general consensus on goals for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) includes the following:
Patients with heart failure and type 2 diabetes experience the lowest risk of death or hospitalization when HbA1c levels fall between 7.1% to 8%. The risks increase at levels below 6% and above 8%.4
While glucose control is still the cornerstone of diabetes management, other risk factors should be carefully monitored, particularly blood pressure. High blood pressure accelerates cardiovascular disease, and the stakes are already too high for those with diabetes.
Achieving blood pressure levels of less than 120 mm Hg/70 mm Hg reduces mortality and promotes better cardiovascular outcomes in patients with and without diabetes. As a result, the American Heart Association advises intervention for any patients with blood pressures higher than 120 mm Hg/70 mm Hg. However, the treatment targets for patients with diabetes and hypertension may range from less than 130 mm Hg/80 mm Hg to less than 140 mm Hg/90 mm Hg, depending on the patient’s risk factors.4
Beyond these metrics, health care is gradually shifting to a more patient-centered approach. This approach encompasses multiple aspects of the patient’s metabolism and behaviors with an ultimate goal of precision medicine that’s highly targeted by additional factors like genetics and highly specific risks.4
Fortunately, just as many lifestyle interventions for diabetes management are good for the heart, diabetes medications have also demonstrated cardiovascular benefits. In one study, patients who were overweight who were newly diagnosed with diabetes experienced a 39% reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarction by taking metformin.
In addition, the long-term use of metformin (10 years) appeared beneficial for the primary prevention of heart disease. It’s considered appropriate therapy for those with diabetes, both those with and without existing heart disease, although more evidence is needed on the potential protective effects in secondary prevention.4
Recent studies show that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists lower the risk for heart failure and atherosclerotic heart disease regardless of the patient’s baseline HbA1c levels.4
A meta-analysis of 3 studies on patients with diabetes and SGLT-2 inhibitors found the following:
GLP-1 agonists have demonstrated similar benefits in randomized control trials, with a systematic review and meta-analysis study showing:
GLP-1 agonists reduce body weight, blood pressure, HbA1c, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. These medications are recommended for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes patients.4
Other diabetes drugs, including insulin, most dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, sulfonylureas, appear to have neutral or positive impacts on cardiovascular health. However, saxagliptin and pioglitazone may be risky in patients with heart failure.4
Diabetes care is traditionally managed by primary care doctors, endocrinologists, nurses, and dietitians. However, casting a wider net for the care team can offer several benefits. Diabetes affects the whole body, impacting vision, kidney function, the cardiovascular system, nervous system, brain, and more.
Health professionals who not only treat these issues but can help prevent them are critical for the significant number of people living with diabetes and prediabetes. Given the well-established link between diabetes and heart health, cardiologists play an essential role in supporting diabetes patients. In addition, pharmacists, community health representatives, mental health providers, and other specialists like nephrologists and ophthalmologists are important players in the diabetes care team.
Earlier introduction of a multidisciplinary team may improve care and outcomes for diabetes patients. Rather than waiting for costly and debilitating complications, recognizing the risks and expanding the care team sooner can improve monitoring and behavior change, providing diabetes patients with a better quality of life.5

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/back-pain-related-to-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-a-guide-for-primary-care-practice/,Back Pain Related to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu: A Guide for Primary Care Practice,"The increasing popularity of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) as a martial art and competitive sport has led to a growing concern regarding the potential risk of injuries, particularly related to back pain. BJJ involves physically demanding training sessions that place significant stress on the spine, increasing the risk of lumbar strains, sprains, and other musculoskeletal injuries. Understanding the etiology of back pain in BJJ is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies to minimize the risk of injury and improve overall spinal health.
BJJ is a combat martial art that consists of grappling, joint manipulations, and chokes. Injuries can occur while the opponent is being taken down or during ground fighting. The main factors associated with sports injuries in BJJ include age, weight, and training intensity.1 Additionally, the physically demanding nature of BJJ, involving high-intensity training sessions, can contribute to lumbar strains and sprains, which are the most common injuries sustained by participants.2 Back pain associated with BJJ can be attributed to various factors including training intensity, improper technique, muscle imbalances, and inadequate conditioning.
Improper technique is a potential risk factor because poor body posture, weight distribution, and spinal alignment can increase the risk of injury and compromise spinal stability.1 Muscle imbalances in the core (abdominal muscles, obliques, transversus abdominis, glutes, etc.), back, and hip muscles can also contribute to back pain in BJJ practitioners.3 Non-professional BJJ practitioners who exhibit poor body posture also experience back pain, indicating a potential need for better conditioning because weak core and back muscles may struggle to support the spine during high-intensity training sessions, leading to injury.4 It is essential for the clinician to identify and address these factors to prevent and manage back pain in BJJ patients.

Preventive measures for back pain in BJJ participants include proper warm-up, stretching, and strengthening exercises. Incorporating strength training exercises that target the core and back muscles improves stability and reduces the risk of injury.3 A thorough warm-up routine before engaging in BJJ training is crucial, as it helps prepare the body for the physical demands of the sport. This warm-up should include dynamic stretches, mobility exercises, and light cardiovascular activities to increase blood flow and raise core body temperature.
Targeted strength training exercises, such as planks, bridges, and hip thrusts, focus on the core, back, and hip muscles, which can help improve spinal stability and reduce the risk of injury. Incorporating these exercises into BJJ training strengthens these muscle groups and promotes better posture and technique. Core stabilization and resistance exercises are also beneficial for athletes with lower back pain.4
Adequate flexibility and mobility in the hip, back, and leg muscles are essential for maintaining spinal stability during BJJ training. Incorporating mobility exercises can help improve flexibility and adopting a proper body posture and technique during training also helps prevent back pain.5
Practitioners of BJJ should focus on maintaining a neutral spine position as much as possible during training. Although some techniques in BJJ require the practitioner to flex, rotate, or twist the spine, the practitioner should attempt to return the spine to a more neutral position as soon as possible. Adopting proper body posture and technique includes learning from experienced coaches and attending seminars or workshops to refine technique and improve body mechanics. This may involve finding the right gym with a coach that practices preventative measures.

The traditional approach to treating low back pain involves pain medication (including opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [NSAIDs]), cold packs, and rest, but these methods may not be effective in the long term. Historically, the mismanagement of low back pain may lead to the over prescription of opioids.6
A more effective approach to treating low back pain focuses on addressing the underlying causes of pain and improving spine stability through specific exercises.7 In one study, McGill stabilization exercises were more effective in reducing pain and functional disability in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain compared to conventional physiotherapy.8
McGill stabilization exercises target specific muscle groups that support the spine, including the core, back, and hip muscles. The primary goal of these exercises is to enhance the spine’s ability to withstand daily stresses and reduce the risk of injury.
The McGill stabilization program includes the following exercises: the bird dog, side bridge, cat-camel, curl-up, and hip hinge.  These exercises, when performed consistently and with proper form, can help reduce the risk of back pain and improve spinal stability in BJJ practitioners and individuals with chronic low back pain.
The McGill stabilization program, which emphasizes addressing the underlying causes of pain and improving spine stability through specific exercises, has been found to be more effective in reducing pain and functional disability for participants of BJJ.8 Further research is needed to develop comprehensive guidelines for preventing and managing back pain and promoting the long-term spinal health of practitioners.Andrew So, MSPA-C, is a graduate of Western University Health Sciences and is currently enrolled in the doctorate of medical science program at A.T.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/opioid-free-surgery-treats-pain/,Opioid-Free Surgery Treats Pain at Every Physical and Emotional Level,"The Conversation — The opioid crisis remains a significant public health challenge in the United States. In 2022, over 2.5 million American adults had an opioid use disorder, and opioids accounted for nearly 76% of overdose deaths.
Some patients are fearful of using opioids after surgery due to concerns about dependence and potential side effects, even when appropriately prescribed by a doctor to manage pain. Surgery is often the first time patients receive an opioid prescription, and their widespread use raises concerns about patients becoming long-term users. Leftover pills from a patient’s prescriptions may also be misused.
Researchers like us are working to develop a personalized and comprehensive surgical experience that doesn’t use opioids. Our approach to opioid-free surgery addresses both physical and emotional well-being through effective anesthesia and complementary pain-management techniques.
Clinicians have used morphine and other opioids to manage pain for thousands of years. These drugs remain integral to anesthesia.
Most surgical procedures use a strategy called balanced anesthesia, which combines drugs that induce sleep and relax muscles with opioids to control pain. However, using opioids in anesthesia can lead to unwanted side effects, such as serious cardiac and respiratory problems, nausea and vomiting, and digestive issues.
Concerns over these adverse effects and the opioid crisis have fueled the development of opioid-free anesthesia. This approach uses non-opioid drugs to relieve pain before, during, and after surgery while minimizing the risk of side effects and dependency. Studies have shown that opioid-free anesthesia can provide similar levels of pain relief to traditional methods using opioids.
Opioid-free anesthesia is currently based on a multimodal approach. This means treatments are designed to target various pain receptors beyond opioid receptors in the spinal cord. Multimodal analgesia uses a combination of at least two medications or anesthetic techniques, each relieving pain through distinct mechanisms. The aim is to effectively block or modulate pain signals from the brain, spinal cord and the nerves of the body.
For instance, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen work by inhibiting COX enzymes that promote inflammation. Acetaminophen, or Tylenol, similarly inhibits COX enzymes. While both acetaminophen and NSAIDs primarily target pain at the surgical site, they can also exert effects at the spinal level after several days of use.
A class of drugs called gabapentinoids, which include gabapentin and pregabalin, target certain proteins to dampen nerve signal transmission. This decreases neuropathic pain by reducing nerve inflammation.
The anesthetic ketamine disrupts pain pathways that contribute to a condition called central sensitization. This disorder occurs when nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain amplify pain signals even when the original injury or source of pain has healed. As a result, normal sensations such as light touch or mild pressure may be perceived as painful, and painful stimuli may feel more intense than usual. By lessening pain sensitivity, ketamine can help reduce the risk of chronic pain.
Regional anesthesia involves injecting local anesthetics near nerves to block pain signals to the brain. This method allows patients to remain awake but pain-free in the numbed area, reducing the need for general anesthesia and its side effects. Common regional techniques include epidurals, spinal anesthesia, and nerve blocks.
By activating different pain pathways simultaneously, multimodal approaches aim to enhance pain relief synergistically.
Psychological factors can significantly influence a patient’s perception of pain. Research indicates that mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances can increase pain levels by up to 50%. This suggests that addressing mood and sleep issues can be essential for pain management and improving overall patient well-being.
Psychological states can intensify the perception of pain by significantly influencing the neural pathways related to pain processing. For example, anxiety and stress activate the body’s fight or flight response, prompting the release of stress hormones that heighten nerve sensitivity. This can make pain feel more intense. Research has also found that higher anxiety levels before surgery are linked to increased anesthesia use during surgery and opioid consumption after surgery.
Complementary and alternative techniques that address psychological factors can reduce pain and opioid use by modulating pain transmission in the nervous system and activating neurochemical pathways that promote pain relief.
For example, aromatherapy uses essential oils to stimulate the olfactory system. This can help reduce pain perception and enhance overall well-being by evoking emotional responses and promoting relaxation.
Music therapy stimulates the auditory system, which can distract patients from pain, lower anxiety levels, and foster emotional healing. This can ultimately lead to reduced pain perception.
Relaxation exercises, such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation, activate the parasympathetic nervous system and help promote a state of rest. Engaging the parasympathetic system helps the body conserve energy, slow your heart rate, lower blood pressure,e and relieve muscle tension. This can lead to decreased pain sensitivity by promoting a state of calmness.
Acupuncture involves inserting thin needles into specific body points, stimulating the release of endorphins and other neurotransmitters. These molecules can interrupt pain signals and promote healing processes within the body.
Transitioning away from opioids in surgery requires a shift in both practice and mindset across the entire health care team. Beyond anesthesiologists, other providers, including surgeons, nurses, and medical trainees, also use opioids in patient care. All providers would need to be open to using alternative pain management techniques throughout the surgical process.
In response to the increasing patient demand for opioid-free surgical care, our team at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center launched the patient-initiated Opioid-Free Surgical Pain Management Program in May 2024. To address both the physical and emotional dimensions of pain while optimizing recovery and safety, we recruited surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, pharmacists, and hospital administrators to participate in the initiative.
Over the course of 6 months, our team enrolled 109 patients, 79 of whom successfully underwent surgeries without opioids. Barriers to participating in the program included patient perception of severe pain, inadequately addressing stress and anxiety before the operation, and limited education in the department about the program.
However, subsequent refinements to the program – such as giving patients muscle relaxants while they were recovering from anesthesia – improved participation and reduced opioid use. Importantly, none of the 19 patients who received opioids while recovering in the hospital post-op required further opioid prescriptions at discharge.
These results reflect the promise of our pathway to minimize reliance on opioids while ensuring effective pain management. Enhanced psychological support for patients and education for providers in surgery departments can broaden the effectiveness of a comprehensive approach to managing pain.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/restless-leg-syndrome-aasm-guidelines-update/,American Academy of Sleep Medicine Guidelines Update: Restless Leg Syndrome,"The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) released a clinical practice guideline (CPG) update in the Journal of Sleep Medicine about the treatment of restless leg syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adult and pediatric patients.
Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a sleep-related movement disorder that can range in severity from occasional leg discomfort during periods of inactivity, typically in the evening or at night, to daily, seemingly constant discomfort and the need to move. Clinical RLS is defined as occurring more than twice per week, accompanied by at least moderate distress.
Periodic limb movements during sleep occur every 15 to 30 seconds in people with RLS. Periodic limb movement disorder is diagnosed when these movements occur at a frequency of more than 15 (adults) or 5 (children) movements per hour.
Neurology Advisor spoke to John W Winkelman, MD, PhD, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, as well as the primary author of AASM’s CPG regarding developments made in the clinical understanding of RLS.
“We’ve made tremendous advances in understanding the pathophysiology of RLS over the last 25 years. At this point, there are 2 clear pieces to understanding what is going on. One is that there is clearly a strong genetic influence. […] The second part of pathophysiology has to do with brain iron deficiency, […] even though serum iron indices are usually normal in people with RLS. So, it appears as if there is some abnormality in the transport of iron into the brain,” Dr Winkelman noted.
The AASM guidelines task force formed recommendations based on a systematic literature review and assessed evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The task force considered RLS efficacy, sleep, quality of life, augmentation (defined as the gradual worsening of RLS symptom intensity), and adverse effects in its treatment recommendations.
This 2024 CPG is an update to the 2012 AASM practice parameter and comprises 28 recommendations for treating RLS in adults, children, and special populations, as well as for treating periodic limb movement disorder in adults.
“There are some big changes [in these guidelines], and they may be a surprise to your readership. I think the one that is most important […] is that although dopaminergic medications demonstrated extraordinary efficacy in the short-term clinical trials, it has now become clear that over the long term, these medications, due to plasticity in the dopaminergic system, worsen the underlying RLS,” said Dr Winkelman. “The last thing that any clinician wants to do is provide something to their patient that makes them worse, even if it makes them a lot better in the short term.”
In contrast to the 2012 AASM practice parameter, the 2024 AASM CPG conditionally recommends against the standard use of the dopaminergic agents ropinirole, pramipexole, rotigotine, and levodopa for the long-term treatment of RLS due to the high risk for augmentation that is associated with extended durations of use.
In addition, the AASM conditionally recommends against the use of bupropion, carbamazepine, clonazepam, valerian, and valproic acid, as these interventions failed to demonstrate clinically meaningful improvement in RLS.
The AASM now recommends the use of gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin, or pregabalin for adults with RLS. These recommendations were graded as strong and were based on data from 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 7 observational studies. These 3 agents were associated with clinically significant improvement in disease severity and pooled adverse event (AE) estimates did not exceed clinical significance.
A key good practice in RLS management is prompt and routine testing of serum iron indices. An iron assessment should occur in the morning after avoiding all iron-containing foods and supplements for a 24-hour period and include measurements of ferritin, iron, and total iron binding capacity. The AASM recommends the use of intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose for patients with a serum ferritin level lower than 100 μg/L, which is well above the usual cutoff for low ferritin. This recommendation was graded as strong and based on data from 5 RCTs, which demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in disease severity with IV ferric carboxymaltose in patients with low ferritin.
“Beyond the strongly recommended [interventions], there are the conditionally recommended agents. So, we have other options [for patients],” said Dr Winkelman.
The conditional recommendations regard the use of dipyridamole, extended-release oxycodone or other mu-opioid agonists, or bilateral high-frequency peroneal nerve stimulation. These recommendations are conditional because they each were based on only 1 or 2 RCTs. However, the 3 interventions demonstrated clinically significant improvement in disease severity. There were no clinically significant safety issues for dipyridamole or peroneal nerve stimulation. The pooled estimates of AEs associated with opioids, however, met clinical significance and clinicians should consider patients’ risk for abuse.
Other conditionally recommended iron supplementation options for patients with low ferritin include IV low molecular weight iron dextran, IV ferumoxytol, and ferrous sulfate. These iron supplementation approaches were conditionally recommended due to a paucity of data. However, IV low molecular weight iron dextran, IV ferumoxytol, and ferrous sulfate were associated with significant improvements in disease severity.
“Two-thirds of people with RLS in the US who are treated with a medication are on a dopamine agent. There is little data on how to switch people who are on these agents to our strongly recommended agents. Thus, these new guidelines refer only to starting medications for people with RLS,” informed Dr Winkelman.
The areas of research needed to inform future CPG updates for RLS include how best to transition patients on dopaminergic agents to recommended interventions while maintaining disease control and lowering risk for augmentation, how to identify patients who would respond to iron supplementation alone, how to approach RLS treatment in special populations, and best practices for managing periodic limb movement disorder.
“These are guidelines. They are not requirements and they are not prohibitions. These are what we consider best practices. If you have evaluated your patient appropriately, warned them about the risk for augmentation, as well as the benefits and side effects of alternative medications, it is the patient who will be making the decision about what they think is best for them. It is a collaborative decision-making process with our patients. That’s really what doctoring is about. No requirements, no prohibitions, just what we consider [to be best practices],” concluded Dr Winkelman.

Despite the prevailing narrative of polarization, Americans frequently agree on essential issues. For instance, there is widespread support for high-quality health care that is accessible to all and for stronger gun-control regulations. Remarkably, many Americans advocate for both the right to bear arms and additional restrictions on firearms.
There is strong support for fundamental democratic principles, including equal protection under the law, voting rights, religious freedoms, freedom of assembly and speech, and a free press.
On critical issues such as climate change, a majority of citizens acknowledge the reality of human-caused climate change and endorse the development of renewable energy. Similarly, support for women’s reproductive rights, including the right to an abortion, is widespread.
Though Republicans tend to be more concerned about the economy when they vote, both Republicans and Democrats rank it highly as a top political priority. Despite a currently strong economy by many standards, however, supporters of both parties believe the economy is performing poorly.
This fact is likely the result of a combination of pandemic-related factors, from reduced spending and increased savings during the height of the pandemic to lingering inflation, partly triggered by the pandemic. Whatever the reason for this shared pessimism over the economy, it clearly helped Donald Trump win the 2024 election.
Overall, Americans have a positive view of immigration. That sentiment has declined in recent years, however, as most Americans now want to see immigration rates reduced—Republicans more so than Democrats.
Part of the tension in the nation’s thinking about immigration is likely the result of a political culture that favors sensational stories and disinformation over more sober consideration of related issues and challenges. For instance, much of this election’s discourse over immigration was marred by fictional and bigoted accounts of immigrants eating pets and inaccurate portrayals of most immigrants as criminals. It should be evident that even shared political perceptions aren’t always based on good evidence or reasons.
Despite the existence of so much common ground, Americans see the nation as polarized. Shared values and concerns matter little if constant exposure to disinformation makes it nearly impossible for half the population to sort fact from fiction.
The perception of division itself can fuel distrust where common ground might otherwise be found among citizens. Even with substantial consensus on many issues, the perception of polarization often drives public discourse. This misalignment can be exacerbated by partisans with something to gain.
Research shows that when people are told that experts are divided on an issue, such as climate change, it can lead to increased polarization. Conversely, emphasizing the fact of scientific consensus tends to unify public concern and action.
The perception among U.S. voters that they disagree more than they agree can precede and perpetuate discord. Differing political camps begin to perceive each other as foes rather than fellow citizens.
This continued perception that Americans are more divided on issues than we actually are poses an enormous threat to democracy. The biggest threat is that people begin to see even neighbors and family members who vote differently as enemies. Stress about holiday interactions with relatives who voted differently is reportedly leading some people to cancel family gatherings rather than spend time together.
Yet, Americans are still potential allies in a larger fight to realize similar political aspirations. If people are too busy attacking each other, they will miss opportunities to unite in defense of shared goals when threats emerge. In fact, they will fail to recognize the real threats to their shared values while busily stoking divisions that make them increasingly vulnerable to disinformation.
Recognizing the public’s shared values is an important step in healing political divides. Philosopher Robert B. Talisse has argued that one way to get started might be to refocus attention on community projects that are nonpolitical but bring together people who don’t normally think of each other as political allies.
This might include, for example, participating in civic or sports clubs, or volunteering to help with local community events. These actions are not overtly politically charged. Rather, they are collaborative in a way that supports community identity rather than partisan identity. It is an exercise in rebuilding civic trust and recognizing each other as fellow citizens, and perhaps even friends, without the tension of partisan politics. Once this trust in each other’s civic identity is healed, it can open a door for meaningful political discussion and understanding of each other’s shared concerns.
If we Americans don’t find ways to recognize our shared values and even our shared humanity, we won’t be able to defend those values when they are challenged.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/how-hhs-fda-cdc-influence-us-vaccine-policy/,"How HHS, FDA, and CDC Can Influence US Vaccine Policy","KFF Health News — With President-elect Donald Trump announcing his intention to nominate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, as Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), and several other nominations expected soon, including for the heads of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), questions have been raised about what influence these appointed health officials have over US vaccine policy. Kennedy, for example, has expressed doubts about the safety and effectiveness of many vaccines, falsely claimed that vaccines are linked to autism, and voiced opposition to vaccine requirements for children, among other policy positions. Does this mean he or other federal officials could change recommendations or remove vaccines from use? Could these officials impose a different set of vaccine requirements for school-age children? To help answer these questions, this policy brief highlights several areas in which HHS, FDA, and CDC have authority to shape US vaccine policy with a specific focus on vaccine approvals and recommendations for the public. Ultimately, while there are limits, federal officials have significant authority to influence and alter vaccine policy, which could affect vaccine availability, views about vaccines, and vaccine use in the US. However, this does not include imposing mandates on or changing local vaccination requirements, as those authorities rest with state and local governments.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the core federal department responsible for improving the health and well-being of Americans. It is headed by a Secretary (a cabinet-level, Senate-confirmed position), and has 13 operating divisions including key federal agencies related to vaccines and vaccination policy in the US:
Importantly, the HHS Secretary oversees these programs, placing them in a crucial position to influence many aspects of federal vaccine policy. For one, under the Public Health Service Act, the HHS Secretary is authorized to establish a National Vaccine Program, which develops a strategic vaccination plan for the nation and coordinates across multiple agencies. The Secretary also has some ability to shift funding, re-organize offices, and make staffing decisions, but only up to a point because major HHS offices and programs are mandated by law and funded through Congressional appropriations. Further, the HHS Secretary generally has the authority to overrule decisions and recommendations of the FDA Commissioner and CDC Director, though this has happened only rarely in the past.
Despite the important role played by the federal government in vaccine policy, neither HHS nor any other part of the federal government may impose or revoke vaccine requirements for children in school, or enforce other broad vaccine mandates at the national level, with the potential exception of during a declared health emergency (federal courts have been mixed in their decisions regarding the extent of federal authority in these circumstances). Under the US Constitution’s 10th Amendment’s “police powers” clause, states are granted primary responsibility for enacting and enforcing laws to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of people in their jurisdictions, which includes public health activities generally and (as upheld in multiple Supreme Court and circuit court decisions) vaccine mandates specifically. Therefore, federal guidance on vaccines and recommended vaccine schedules are guidance, not mandates. State and local decision-makers take this information and determine if a vaccine should be required and for what purpose, and whether individuals may opt out of requirements.
While the HHS Secretary, FDA Commissioner, and CDC Director cannot impose a national vaccine mandate (outside of a declared public health emergency, and only then under limited circumstances) or revoke existing state and local level vaccine requirements, here are some ways in which they can influence vaccine policy decisions by states, localities, pediatricians, parents, and individuals:
The FDA and CDC each have external expert advisory committees that provide important input into vaccine policy decisions. FDA commonly seeks input from the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) during vaccine reviews, and the FDA Commissioner uses VRBPAC recommendations when weighing approvals and other regulatory decisions about vaccines. CDC receives input from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which reviews available evidence and makes recommendations to the CDC Director on individual vaccines and immunization schedules for children and adults. In addition, vaccines recommended by ACIP and adopted by CDC for children ages 18 and younger are automatically covered by the Vaccines for Children (VCP) program, and, per a provision of the Affordable Care Act, ACIP recommendations that have been adopted by the CDC must be covered at no cost by most health plans.
Given their roles in informing federal vaccine decisions, it is possible to exert policy influence through changes in the work of these committees. According to the committee charters and existing legal authorities, HHS leaders have the discretion to:
The FDA Commissioner and CDC Director (and HHS Secretary), as part of their authorities related to vaccines, have discretion over aspects of the review process and can adjust criteria and timelines to aid or hinder vaccine licensing applications and criteria used for approvals and recommendations. For example:
Beyond its role in determining vaccine approvals and recommendations, the federal government plays a critical role in communicating to the public about vaccines, and these communications may influence public behavior. In recent years, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increased vaccine hesitancy among the public and reduced trust in federal health authorities including the CDC and FDA, and these views have often diverged along partisan lines. As a result, routine vaccination rates have fallen, including among kindergarten age children. Moreover, the number of states allowing for non-medical vaccine exemptions has risen. In some cases, reductions in vaccination coverage have been associated with outbreaks in parts of the country. Should federal officials choose to communicate doubt about vaccine safety and effectiveness, that is not supported by the data, or to not communicate about vaccines, it could provide momentum to state and local authorities seeking to loosen or eliminate school vaccine requirements, and could lead to a growing share of the public choosing not to get vaccinated or not to have their children vaccinated, which could have significant implications for individual and population health.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/plaque-on-tongue/,Dermatologic Clinic: Plaque on Tongue,"A 60-year-old Black man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes presents with a 1-month history of a yellowish, green furry plaque on his tongue. He states that he drinks several cups of coffee and eats oatmeal daily. He does not have any pain with the plaque but does endorse a slight burning sensation. He also notes his food has tasted differently lately, and he wonders if it could be related to the changes on his tongue.
Hairy tongue, first documented in 1835 by Rayer, was initially observed in an adult male patient.¹ The condition affects both genders and is estimated to impact approximately 0.5% to 5.0% of the population.2 However, the prevalence varies significantly, with some studies indicating rates as low as 8.3% in children and as high as 57% among individuals addicted to drugs or incarcerated.3 Other reports suggest an overall prevalence of 13% in the general population.⁴ Such variability in prevalence can be attributed to differences in study design, population characteristics, and diagnostic methods. Although hairy tongue appears unrelated to the patient’s race, global variations may exist due to differences in dietary habits, oral hygiene, and bacterial diversity.5
Hairy tongue is characterized by hypertrophy of the papillae, which gives the tongue a hairy appearance. This occurs because of a lack of stimulation, leading to excessive papillae growth beyond the usual 1 mm, with dead cells and debris accumulating on the tongue’s surface. The accumulation of keratin on the dorsum of the tongue, which is not naturally broken down due to insufficient chewing, is thought to contribute to the condition.⁶ Hairy tongue is not typically linked to underlying diseases, but several risk factors have been identified, including a history of tobacco use, frequent consumption of coffee or tea, HIV, and intravenous drug use.²
Several risk factors contribute to hairy tongue, such as smoking, poor oral hygiene, chronic antibiotic use, consumption of hot beverages, and oxidizing mouthwashes.⁶ Epidemiologic data indicate that men are approximately 3 times more likely to develop hairy tongue than women, primarily because of higher smoking rates and poorer oral hygiene.⁴ Furthermore, the condition is found more frequently in older adults, with a prevalence of 40% in individuals over 60 years of age.⁴ Certain neurologic disorders affecting tongue movement or chewing also increase the risk. Diet consisting mainly of liquid or soft foods may prevent keratin breakdown due to less mechanical abrasion of the tongue, thereby causing hairy tongue.
Clinically, hairy tongue appears as a furry, hair-like layer on the dorsal midportion of the tongue, without affecting the lateral regions.⁶ The elongated papillae can present in various colors, including black, brownish-black, yellow-green, or even unpigmented.⁴ These color variations often arise from external factors such as tobacco use, food residues, or bacteria.⁶ While typically asymptomatic, hairy tongue can cause discomfort, with some patients experiencing symptoms like a metallic taste, burning sensation, halitosis, or a gagging feeling when the tongue touches the palate.
Dermoscopic analysis of hairy tongue reveals yellow-brownish to black-hair elongation of the filiform papillae.⁵ Histologically, there is thickening of the filiform papillae due to hyperkeratosis, with bacterial and yeast overgrowth, sometimes accompanied by non-specific inflammation.⁷ Trapped debris and Candida pseudohyphae may also be observed.⁸
The differential diagnosis of hairy tongue includes various conditions such as oral hairy leukoplakia, pigmented fungiform papillae, and acanthosis nigricans.⁴ Oral hairy leukoplakia appears as white patches on the tongue, often triggered by Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), particularly in individuals with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV or AIDS.⁸ Pigmented fungiform papillae present as isolated dark lesions, primarily on the sides and tip of the tongue, predominantly in individuals with darker skin. Acanthosis nigricans in the oral cavity manifests as multiple dark, well-defined papillary lesions, sometimes extending to the lips, often linked to underlying malignancies.⁴
Diagnosis of hairy tongue is usually based on visual inspection of the mouth.⁴ Microscopic examination may show papillae exceeding 3 mm in length, and cultures may be performed to identify associated bacterial or fungal infections.⁴ Although not always required, a tongue biopsy can be helpful if the lesions are characteristic of black hairy tongue.⁴
Treatment for hairy tongue is generally simple and primarily involves improving oral hygiene. Tongue scraping using a toothbrush or a dedicated tongue scraper is effective for removing elongated papillae.⁶ Good oral hygiene, combined with regular tongue cleaning, is key to managing the condition.² Lifestyle changes, such as reducing excessive tea or coffee consumption and avoiding oxidizing mouthwashes, may also be beneficial. In cases where these conservative measures fail, surgical intervention using electrodesiccation or scissors may be considered as a last resort.²
The patient was recommended to switch to a new toothbrush and use a tongue scraper to remove the hyperkeratosis. He was also educated on cutting back on his coffee consumption and was recommended to eat a balanced diet.","Lana Dokic, BSA; Yelena Dokic, MD"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/osteoporosis-prevent-fractures-keep-bones-healthy/,Osteoporosis: How to Prevent Fractures and Keep Bones Healthy,"The Conversation — Because there are typically no symptoms until the first fracture occurs, osteoporosis is considered a silent disease. Some call it a silent killer.
Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by decreased bone density and strength, leading to fragile, brittle bones that increase the risk of fractures, especially in the spine, hips and wrists.
The National Osteoporosis Foundation estimates that more than 10 million Americans have osteoporosis. Another 43 million have low bone mass, which is the precursor to osteoporosis. By 2030, the number of adults with osteoporosis or low bone mass is estimated to increase by more than 30%, to 71 million.
The reasons for the increase include lifestyle issues, particularly smoking, lack of physical activity and alcohol abuse. Our aging population, along with the insufficient attention paid to this disease, are also why osteoporosis is on the rise.
If you are older, it may be discouraging to read those statistics. But as orthopedic specialists who have studied this disease, we know that osteoporosis is not inevitable. The key to having healthy bones for a lifetime is to take some simple preventive measures – and the earlier, the better.
Although the symptoms are not obvious early on, certain signs will indicate your bones are becoming weaker. The most serious complications of osteoporosis are fractures, which can lead to chronic pain, hospitalization, disability, depression, reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Worldwide, osteoporosis causes nearly 9 million fractures annually. That’s one osteoporotic fracture every three seconds.
Minor bumps or falls may lead to fractures, especially in the hip, wrist or spine. These types of fractures are often the first sign of the disease.
If you notice that you’re getting shorter, the cause could be compression fractures in the spine; this too is a common symptom of osteoporosis.
Although it’s typical for most people to lose height as they age – about 1 to 1½ inches (2.5 cm to 3.8 cm) over a lifetime – those with osteoporosis who have multiple spinal fractures could lose 2 in to 3 in or more in a relatively rapid time frame.
Curved posture, or noticeable changes in posture, may lead to a hunched back, which could be a sign that your spine is weakening and losing density.
Persistent back pain is another indicator – this too is the result of tiny fractures or compression of the spine.
Osteoporosis cannot be completely cured, but certain lifestyle and dietary factors can lower your risk.
Calcium and vitamin D are essential for bone health. Calcium helps maintain strong bones, while vitamin D assists in calcium absorption. Women over age 50 and men over 70 should consume at least 1200 milligrams of calcium daily from food and, if necessary, supplements.
The easy way to get calcium is through dairy products. Milk, yogurt and cheese are among the richest sources. One cup of milk provides about 300 milligrams of calcium, one-fourth of the daily requirement. If you are vegan, calcium is in many plant-based foods, including soy, beans, peas, lentils, oranges, almonds and dark leafy greens.
Adults should aim for 2 to 3 servings of calcium-rich foods daily. Consuming them throughout the day with meals helps improve absorption.
Vitamin D is obtained mostly from supplements and sunlight, which is the easiest way to get the recommended dose. Your body will produce enough vitamin D if you expose your arms, legs and face to direct sunlight for 10 to 30 minutes between 10 am and 3 pm, 2 to 3 times a week.
Although it’s best to wear short-sleeve shirts and shorts during this brief period, it’s okay to wear sunglasses and apply sunscreen to your face. Sunlight through a window won’t have the same effect – glass reduces absorption of the UV rays needed for vitamin D production. People with darker skin, or those living in less sunny regions, may need more sunlight to get the same effect.
If a doctor has given you a diagnosis of osteoporosis, it’s possible the calcium and vitamin D that you’re getting through food and sun exposure alone is not enough; you should ask your doctor if you need medication.
Regular exercise is an excellent activity that can help stave off osteoporosis. Weight-bearing exercises, such as brisk walking, jogging and dancing, are great for increasing bone density. Strength training, such as lifting weights, helps with stability and flexibility, which reduces the risk of falling.
Aim for 30 minutes of weight-bearing exercise at least 4 days a week, combined with muscle-strengthening exercises at least twice a week.
Particularly for women, who lose bone density during and after menopause, regular exercise is critical. Working out prior to menopause will reduce the risk of osteoporosis in your later years.
And avoid harmful habits – smoking and heavy alcohol consumption can weaken bone density and increase the risk of fractures.
Fall prevention strategies and balance training are crucial and can help reduce the risk of fractures.
Women should start osteoporosis screening at age 65, according to the US Preventive Services Task Force. The task force also recommends screening postmenopausal women younger than 65 who have one or more risk factors for osteoporosis, which is a really important population and part of its overall guidance.
Men should consider screening if they have risk factors for osteoporosis, which include smoking, alcohol use disorder, some chronic diseases such as diabetes, and age. Men over 70 are at higher risk.
Medical imaging such as a bone density scan and spinal X-rays can help confirm osteoporosis and detect compression fractures. These basic tests, combined with age and medical history, are enough to make a clear diagnosis.
Managing osteoporosis is a long-term process that requires ongoing commitment to lifestyle changes. Recognizing the early warning signs and making these proactive lifestyle changes is the first step to prevent the disease and keep your bones healthy.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/online-therapy-domestic-violence/,Telemedicine: A Lifeline for Patients Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence,"About 33% of women and 25% of men experience intimate partner violence (IPV) at some point in their lifetime.1 This widespread issue can leave individuals heavily guarded and controlled by their abusers, leading to “physical, sexual, or psychological harm.”1
With the COVID-19 pandemic came an unprecedented boom in telemedicine across medical specialties, including mental health care. According to a survey of 3500 family practitioners and pediatricians, rates of telehealth offerings spiked from just 12% in 2016 to 90% by spring of 2020.1
This rapid growth of telemedicine invited health care providers into the intimate setting of people’s homes, an increasing number of whom were cast under the dark shadow of IPV.2 Research suggests that the isolating and stressful circumstances of the pandemic spurred higher rates of IPV worldwide.3 Electronic health care has been especially significant for patients in this population, introducing unique challenges, advantages, and considerations.
Domestic Violence Awareness Month is observed each year in October. To contribute to this vital conversation, we spoke with Allison Paugh, a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) and learned more about this timely topic.
Allison has extensive experience working with patients in both in-person and telehealth settings. Overall, she feels that people facing IPV have benefited from the expansion of teletherapy.
“Many patients I have had who participated in telehealth have done well with the transition,” Allison shared. “In most cases, the patient feels this is more convenient for them whether that be due to transportation concerns, childcare, or other mental health symptoms that make telehealth a better option.”
Nonetheless, providers must thoughtfully consider the most appropriate ways to delivery teletherapy to patients dealing with IPV at home. Missteps can abruptly prompt the discontinuation of services or worse. Here are some crucial mistakes to avoid and best practices to incorporate in order to ensure the safe and successful delivery of care.
Allison said many studies have found telehealth services to be well-accepted and helpful for individuals experiencing IPV. She explained, “There have been advantages (ie, easier accessibility, comfort in continuation of resources), but there have also been new challenges.”
“[Individuals experiencing IPV], who may have already lived in forced isolation, experienced increased feelings of isolation and loneliness [during the COVID-19 lockdowns]. [Those facing IPV] may also have heightened anxiety over loss of privacy and may present as more guarded during their telehealth visit due to fear of retaliation from their partner,” advised Allison.
Research suggests that survivors of IPV run the risk of escalating violence if an abusive partner becomes aware that IPV is being disclosed and discussed.4 Targeted strategies can help mitigate this risk and maintain communication and support from counselors.
According to Allison, “Implementing systematic privacy protection and trauma-informed approach has the potential to achieve comprehensive and psychosocial support.”
She feels “a trusting and therapeutic relationship should not be compromised with telehealth services. Providers should be utilizing screenings that only require a yes or no response (due to partner listening), as well as providing supportive resources through email or sharing of online resources.”
Allison recommends following the CUES mnemonic:
The National Health Resource Center on Domestic Violence offers a free resource that includes examples of telehealth scripts that encompass these principles.5 The American Psychiatric Association also has a free resource providers can download to learn how to ensure digital safety when providing teletherapy for patients experiencing IPV.6
Allison said, “Overall, in addition to implementing strategies and screenings, providers should be providing person-centered care that ensures privacy. The provider should be aware that violence may be happening and proceed with conversations with caution.”
A report published in the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine outlines priorities for mental health providers when counseling patients in domestic violence situations. After establishing rapport, providers should teach concrete safety skills, like packing an emergency bag, locating helplines and shelters, and deleting call history with the therapist. They can talk through strategies for responding to different scenarios. Providers can also help patients learn to recognize behaviors associated with violence in the past, such as financial stress or substance abuse.4
Providers must use discretion when deciding if the benefits of teletherapy outweigh the risks. Some contraindications for teletherapy include patients with:
Such cases should be referred to in-person care or emergency services. If a patient’s safety is at risk, the therapist should wait for the patient to initiate contact or contact an emergency helpline if unable to reconnect.4
Providers can ask specific questions to determine whether they have private access to patients experiencing IPV.1
If they’re unsure whether the patient is alone, the provider can ask, “Is this a safe time for you to talk?” or “Are you alone?” If the provider knows that the perpetrator of abuse is present, they may say, “HIPPA laws require me to provide telehealth sessions without anyone else present.” Although the provider still can’t be completely sure that no one is listening in, these phrases can help.
Allison discussed how teletherapy worked for her patients. “I have found that the IPV patients with ‘low safety concerns’ have transitioned better than those who experience more complex IPV relationships,” she explained.
“Specifically, I was treating one patient whose partner did not ‘believe’ in medication and was unaware that the patient was receiving psychotropic medications.  When telehealth appointments were utilized, the patient was guarded and vague in answering had a quiet tone and felt distracted from the session. Eventually, for a period of time, the patient completely stopped all appointments.”
“Fortunately, she resumed telehealth appointments once the patient’s partner had a full-time job that allowed the patient to have privacy during sessions. The patient commented that the risk of their partner finding out that treatment included medication was greater than the benefit received from medication therapy.  During the time frame of stopping appointments (as well as medication), the patient’s progress deteriorated, and the treatment plan had to be adapted for the patient to again ‘start over’ at implementing strategies/coping techniques for further progress.”
Mental health providers must be vigilant and sensitive to patients’ situations at home. Some sessions may be more conducive to discussing IPV, while others may not. Nonetheless, it’s essential to maintain lines of communication and avoid risks that could compromise a patient’s ability to continue with teletherapy.
Research on telemedicine during the pandemic shows that telehealth services were accessed more frequently by those experiencing IPV than people who were not. Experts have theorized that this may be because IPV takes a significant toll on physical and mental health, causing increased health care needs.2 Now that steps have been taken to provide remote health services, many patients will likely continue to prefer this mode of care.
Allison feels the pandemic-related boost in telehealth is here to stay. “I feel that telehealth services will continue to be offered and utilized. Allowing telehealth services to have made a significant impact on the utilization of services,” she explained. “The pandemic has allowed us to expand specialized care in the home setting, hopefully improving patient outcomes and elevating patient experiences. As change occurs, providers are working to improve their change from ‘bedside manner’ to ‘webside manner.’”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/np-liable-failing-to-diagnose-breast-cancer/,Nurse Practitioner Found Liable for Failing to Diagnose Breast Cancer,"Ms E, was a 45-year-old nurse practitioner with a specialty in women’s health care at the time of this case. She worked at a women’s health clinic alongside other NPs and obstetricians/gynecologists. One day a young woman came in for an appointment. Miss K was 22 years old, had recently graduated from college, and was newly employed as a registered nurse. Miss K told the clinician that while in the shower she thought she felt a lump in her right breast, and she was concerned enough to come in to be checked.
Ms E performed a comprehensive breast examination and did not find a lump. She did, however, note that the patient’s breasts were dense. She noted “fibrocystic changes” in the chart and told Miss K that she did not feel a lump, but that some breast changes were normal during the menstrual cycle.
“Come back in 2 weeks for a follow-up breast exam,” said Ms E. “You will be at a different point in your cycle, and we will see if that fact changes anything.”
Two weeks later, Miss K returned. Ms E performed another breast examination and did not note any concerning lumps, although she did note in the patient’s chart that Miss K had fibrocystic changes bilaterally. Ms E reassured the patient that everything seemed fine and advised Miss K to follow up with her as needed. The clinician suspected that the patient, a new nurse, might be suffering from health anxiety as a result of her job.
Eight months later, Miss K returned to the clinic. This time she saw one of the physicians (OB/GYN). Miss K told the doctor that she felt intermittent burning in her right breast, that her right breast was visibly larger than the left breast, that she experienced occasional itching of the skin over her right breast, and that there was an indentation in her skin on that breast.
The OB/GYN noted a mass in the patient’s right breast and ordered a breast ultrasound and an appointment with a breast surgeon. The ultrasound revealed a “3.8-centimeter ill-defined hypoechoic area consistent with the palpable lump.” A few weeks later, a biopsy showed that Miss K had invasive breast cancer, with a diagnosis of Stage IIB breast cancer in the right breast. The primary tumor was 4 cm. The cancer had spread to her lymph nodes, requiring a bilateral mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and reconstruction.
Miss K, only 22 years old, underwent egg harvesting to protect her ability to have children in the future, before undergoing 8 rounds of chemotherapy and 28 radiation treatments.
Following treatment, Miss K consulted with a plaintiff’s attorney to discuss suing for medical malpractice. The attorney had a medical expert review the records and the expert believed that negligence had occurred. The attorney took the case and filed a lawsuit against Ms E (and various other defendants, most of whom were eventually dismissed from the case.)
Ms E met with the defense attorney provided by her malpractice insurance. This attorney also had a medical expert review the records, and the expert noted that Ms E had complied with guidelines provided by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which does not mandate or recommend imaging in women under the age of 30.
Settlement negotiations failed and the case finally made it to a jury trial.
The trial lasted for 10 days and involved numerous medical experts testifying as to how Ms E either failed or upheld the requisite standard of care.
The plaintiff’s experts criticized Ms E’s treatment of the patient and claimed that it fell below the required standard of care. Specifically, the plaintiff noted that Ms E failed to specifically document her findings from the 2 appointments, including a breast diagram, pain scale, or presence of breast discharge. Ms E’s failure to order breast imaging resulted in the cancer’s spread to the patient’s lymph nodes. The plaintiff’s attorney argued that Ms E’s failure to order a diagnostic baseline mammogram or a targeted ultrasound was a costly deviation from the standard of care. The plaintiff also charged the NP with failing to provide proper follow-up care instructions and patient education to Miss K. Finally, the plaintiff’s attorney argued that all of these failures by Ms E to meet the standard of care had caused Miss K the loss of decades of life, as well as prolonged treatment, and significant pain and suffering.
The defense argued that Ms E met the standard of care because she did not feel a lump, and therefore did not document one. Defense experts testified that Ms E had conducted a thorough examination and that she had followed guidelines provided by the ACOG, which does not mandate imaging in a woman under 30. Furthermore, defense medical experts pointed out that based on the oncotype of Miss K’s cancer, she would still have needed the same chemotherapy and radiation treatment when she was first seen by Ms E, and some form of surgery would have been required (although the plaintiff argued that because of Ms E’s failure to diagnose, the patient ultimately needed a bilateral mastectomy instead of a lumpectomy.) The defense argued that Miss K’s risk of harm was not increased by Ms E’s failure to order imaging when she first saw the patient.
The jury deliberated for 2 hours before returning a verdict for the plaintiff and awarding her $18 million.
Ms K assumed that breast cancer was unlikely in a 22-year-old. It was a reasonable assumption because breast cancer is very rare in someone that age and even the AGOG guidelines do not normally recommend imaging at that age. But it was a wrong assumption.
Use caution in making assumptions. Had Ms K ordered an ultrasound or baseline mammogram, the cancer could have been identified earlier, perhaps resulting in a better outcome for the patient.","Ann W. Latner, JD"

Then, in October 2023, an email came from the Pasadena Public Health Department: A person in the city had contracted California’s first-known case of dengue from a local mosquito.
“When it happens in real time, real life, you know, it is very different,” Farned said. “There’s no room for error here. We have to be quick and effective in identifying the most at-risk areas and responding.”
Across California, public health and pest control authorities are facing a new reality as the Aedes mosquitoes bring the threat of dengue and potentially other tropical diseases, such as chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever, that were once of concern only to international travelers.
So far this year, authorities have identified at least 13 cases of locally acquired dengue, up from 2 in 2023, with 11 in Los Angeles County and 2 in the San Diego area. The Aedes mosquitoes spread the disease by biting an infected person and then biting a previously uninfected person.
Mosquito-borne viral illnesses, chiefly malaria, have long been a scourge in many tropical regions, and preventive measures focus mainly on controlling the mosquitoes. The Aedes mosquitoes, known for their aggressive, daytime biting, are now present in at least 24 California counties. They breed in water, in as little as a capful.
“When these locally acquired cases occur, … we want to act on them pretty quickly so that it does not become an endemic infection in our region,” said Aiman Halai, MD, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health’s Vector-Borne Disease Unit.
California officials are hoping to beat back dengue by expanding mosquito surveillance, developing detailed response plans for mosquito outbreaks and human infections, and improving data sharing across agencies. They’re also going door to door in neighborhoods to remove standing water sources and apply pesticides. Residents are advised to wear bug repellent and long-sleeved clothing and control mosquitoes around their homes to prevent biting and infection.
Some vector control districts — local agencies charged with managing disease-bearing insects and other animals — are even growing their own sterile mosquitoes to release into the wild to reduce local Aedes populations.
Outside of California, locally acquired dengue cases have occurred in Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, and Texas. In March, Puerto Rico declared a public health emergency after a spike in cases there, where dengue is endemic. Meanwhile, worldwide dengue cases are on track to more than double this year, with 12.3 million documented through August, up from 6.5 million in 2023, according to the World Health Organization.
Most people who get dengue have no symptoms, but about 1 in 4 become ill. A mild case can feel like the flu and usually dissipates within a week, but about 5% of those infected with dengue become very sick, with symptoms that can include internal bleeding, shock, and organ failure, and the most severe cases can be fatal. People infected a second time are at especially high risk.
There is no specific medication to treat dengue. Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda developed a vaccine that has won approval in Europe and elsewhere, though it withdrew an application to the FDA last year, saying it could not provide data requested by the agency. A vaccine developed in Brazil could soon be approved for use in that country. But the only FDA-approved vaccine is authorized only for children in narrow circumstances and will soon go out of production.
At the San Gabriel Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District, 1 of 5 agencies tasked with mosquito control across Los Angeles County, public health workers have put together an Aedes and dengue response plan based on updated guidance from the state.
When they discover a case, they identify all the properties and public spaces within 150 meters — roughly the distance an Aedes mosquito can fly — and then go door to door, removing standing water, where mosquitoes can breed; applying pesticides from backpacks or trucks; and educating residents about the risk of dengue and how to protect themselves. District officials also set traps to catch mosquitoes so they can figure out their prevalence and test them for dengue.
Since local dengue cases began to appear, the district has gotten more efficient in implementing its response plan, district manager Farned said. All full-time and seasonal staff members — about 40 people — have been trained in a variety of tasks, such as door-to-door education and coming in during off-hours to answer phones, Farned said.
While vector control teams respond to cases, separate teams from the Los Angeles County Public Health Department go door to door in the affected neighborhood when they determine that a dengue case was locally acquired, surveying residents and offering free dengue testing to try to identify others who may be infected.
Additionally, the department has been sending alerts to local health providers, advising them to be on the lookout for possible dengue cases and test for it when suspected, even among patients who haven’t traveled to a place where dengue is endemic. This advice follows a national alert put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in June. Health authorities are also emphasizing that people who travel to locations with dengue should continue to wear mosquito repellent when they get home, to reduce the risk of spreading the disease to local mosquitoes.
As happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, mistrust of public health authorities can make outreach challenging for health and pest control teams in some neighborhoods, officials said.
Pest control officers can seek a warrant to enter and treat a property for mosquitoes if a homeowner refuses to give access, said Jeremy Wittie, a former president and the legislative committee chair for the Mosquito and Vector Control Association of California, which represents the more than 70 mosquito and vector control agencies in California. This is easier in districts such as his, the Coachella Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District, that have warrants giving officials standing permission to enter a property after 24 hours without needing to ask a judge.
In counties such as Santa Clara, where Aedes mosquitoes first appeared in 2022 but have yet to establish themselves, officials hope to suppress the threat with stepped-up surveillance, speedy eradication efforts, and more public outreach. Santa Clara County Vector Control District Manager Nayer Zahiri said the aim was to eliminate Aedes but acknowledged the climate conditions that encourage the mosquitoes’ spread are “totally out of our control.”
In some counties with pervasive mosquito problems, including San Diego, San Joaquin, and Stanislaus, officials have sprayed pesticides from planes or helicopters to address spikes in local mosquito populations, Wittie said. These sprayings typically aim to control the larvae of a different type of mosquito, Culex, that can spread West Nile virus and which — unlike the Aedes species, which thrive in urban habitats — are found in harder-to-reach rural environments, Wittie said.
Aerial spraying hasn’t been deployed to address the recent dengue outbreaks, which are in more urban environments where spraying from trucks is a better option, Wittie said. Drones are another option that some vector control authorities are exploring.
Some districts are experimenting with the decades-old sterile insect technique, commonly used for other pests such as fruit and screwworm flies, in which males are sterilized with radiation and then released to mate, resulting in eggs that don’t hatch. (Female mosquitoes are separated from the males before sterilization and not released. Only the females bite).
Ultimately, the public will have to take the mosquito threat more seriously and contribute to prevention efforts, Wittie said. “This mosquito is going to be here to stay, unfortunately. I hope it kind of wakes people up and pushes them to be part of that solution.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/bariatric-surgery-for-weight-loss/,Bariatric Surgery for Weight Loss: Gastric Sleeve vs Gastric Bypass,"Our easy-to-read fact sheets provide clinicians with reliable information to share with patients and their caregivers.
Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is an effective treatment for patients with severe obesity and related conditions and has become one of the most commonly performed operations in general surgery. MBS procedure types include sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), adjustable gastric banding (AGB), biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, and single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S). This patient fact sheet will focus on the 2 most common forms of bariatric surgery — sleeve gastrectomy and RYGB — which account for about 90% of all MBS operations performed globally.1
Sleeve gastrectomy involves removing about 80% of the stomach and helps decrease the amount of food and calories consumed, so the body can achieve and maintain a healthy weight and blood sugar control.2 The operation is safe without potential related complications from surgery on the small intestine.2
RYGB involves dividing the stomach into a smaller top pouch, and the larger part is bypassed and can no longer store or digest food.3 The procedure also divides the small intestine, which is connected to the new stomach pouch to allow food to pass. Modifying the food course through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract leads to reduced hunger and increased fullness and allows the body to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.3
Advantages of sleeve gastrectomy include a simple and shorter procedure time, and it can be performed in patients who have high-risk comorbidities (Table 1).2 It also may be used as a bridge to gastric bypass or SADI-S procedures and provides effective weight loss and improvement for related conditions. Among the disadvantages, it is nonreversible, may worsen or cause reflux and heartburn, and has less effect on metabolism compared with bypass procedures.2
RYGB can provide long-term weight loss, is effective for obesity-associated conditions, and has a standardized approach.3 However, it is a more complex procedure and is associated with vitamin and mineral deficiencies vs sleeve gastrectomy or gastric banding. There is also an accompanying risk for small bowel complications, ulcers, and sickness after eating or drinking.3
In 2022, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) published joint guidelines on MBS and made the following recommendations1:
Long-term data have shown that bariatric surgery is safe, effective, and durable for clinically severe obesity and its comorbidities and is associated with reduced mortality.1 Bariatric surgery also may improve or prevent conditions, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.4
Bariatric surgery also may be associated with a risk for adverse events, including excessive bleeding, infection, reactions to anesthesia, blood clots, breathing problems, leaks in the GI system, and death (rarely).4 Longer-term risks and complications may include bowel obstruction, gallstones, hernias, low blood sugar, and malnutrition.4
Choosing the right procedure is based on assessment of the benefit-risk ratio and of patient-related parameters, such as BMI and comorbidities.5 Long-term results are associated with factors other than surgery, especially patient behavioral factors.5
Each type of bariatric surgery has its own set of pros and cons, and patients are advised to speak with their physician about choosing the type of surgery that is best for them.4
Surgeons may ask their patients to begin a special preoperative diet 2 or 3 weeks before surgery to shrink the liver and reduce fat in the abdomen, and most patients will have their appetite return 6 to 18 months after surgery, though it will be easier to satisfy.6 A multivitamin should be taken for life, and higher doses may be needed for iron, calcium, and vitamin D.6
After surgery, patients may begin with a liquid diet and then consume soft foods, such as cottage cheese, yogurt, or soup for several weeks.7 Health care providers can advise patients on which foods and beverages can be consumed and which ones to avoid.7 A registered dietitian can assist postoperative patients with food intolerances, micronutrient deficiencies, and weight regain.1
Sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass have resulted in similar effects on weight loss and diabetes outcomes as well as safety for at least 5 years.8 Recent research found that the sleeve procedure is associated with fewer reoperations, and the bypass procedure may lead to more durable weight loss and glycemic control.8
A recent randomized clinical trial found that laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic RYGB led to sustainable weight loss at 10 years, with reflux more prevalent after sleeve gastrectomy and the incidence of Barrett esophagus similar after the 2 procedures.9
Other research found that adults lost more weight with RYGB than with sleeve gastrectomy or AGB at 1, 3, and 5 years, although RYGB had the highest 30-day rate of major adverse events.10
After RYGB, patients may lose about one-third of their total body weight, with the maximum effect on weight loss typically occurring in the first 2 years.11 Some weight regain may occur, but most studies have found that a majority of patients will maintain weight loss of about 25% beyond 10 years.
After sleeve gastrectomy, most weight loss occurs in the first 2 years (>70% excess weight loss for BMI <50 kg/m2), and weight regain and gastric pouch dilatation may occur afterward.11 Sustained weight loss of 50% to 60% of excess weight may be achieved at 5 years.
Insurance companies may require patients to enroll in a weight loss program before qualifying for surgery, and some insurance companies require a physician-monitored diet 3 to 6 months before surgery.6 The average cost of bariatric surgery ranges from $17,000 to $26,000, and estimates indicate that third-party payers will recover surgery costs within 2 to 4 years.12

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/austin-shinaberry-became-an-advocate-for-veterans/,From Marine to PA School: How Austin Shinaberry Became an Advocate for Veterans,"By high school, Austin Shinaberry knew he wanted to join the military. His grandfather served in World War II in the Army Air Corps, where he became a prisoner of war in Nazi Germany. “I had his diary from when he was a prisoner of war and his experience sparked an interest in me to want to join the military,” Shinaberry told The Clinical Advisor.
It was during his service in the Marine Corps that Shinaberry was first exposed to asbestos. Shinaberry did his basic training in Parris Island, South Carolina, and then went to communication school at Fort Eisenhower, formerly known as Fort Gordon, in Augusta, Georgia. “There were signs posted all over our barracks [at Parris Island and Fort Eisenhower] warning of asbestos exposure,” he said. It was at Fort Eisenhower where many of his health issues began. Shinaberry recorded his exposures to asbestos throughout his training and deployments.
Shinaberry excelled in the Marines. He spent 2 years with the Seventh Communication Battalion, part of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, in Japan, and then the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, where he was attached to the USS Bonhomme Rashard, including deployments to South Korea, Australia, and Guam. From there, Shinaberry went to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.
Berry accumulated 4 years of active and 4 years of inactive service in the Inactive ready reserves. After discharge from the Marines, Shinaberry moved to Tampa, Florida. Because of his exposure to asbestos, Shinaberry developed neuroendocrine tumor of the appendix that caused hematological conditions. A fellow veteran working at the VA Hospital suggested Shinaberry take an anatomy/physiology class at the local community college. “I liked the class and I started tutoring other students. This eventually led me to apply and get accepted to the University of South Florida, where I graduated with a bachelor’s in health science,” he said.
From there, the VA offered Shinaberry a benefit called Vocational rehabilitation and employment (Also known as Chapter 31.)  where the VA assisted him in paying tuition, room and board to attend Physician Associate School. He is currently a PA student at Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston, where he is on his surgical rotation.
Shinaberry credits his PA education with helping him to advocate for himself to get coverage for medical issues he developed while in service, including disability benefits. “I was diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumor on my appendix, which is a very rare form of cancer,” he said. Initially, the VA did not want to cover his treatment, but Shinaberry was able to provide the VA with proof that the tumor was related to asbestos exposure during his time in the military. He also developed hematological conditions following his diagnosis related to his tumor
The military has never questioned that Shinaberry was exposed to asbestos during his service. During the 6 months before his first diagnosis, the VA was trying to convince Shinaberry it “was in my head.” What he was experiencing was carcinoid syndrome, a paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to neuroendocrine tumors. “The tumor secretes hormones such as histamines, bradykinins, serotonin, which were building up in my body. I was having horrible abdominal pains, gastrointestinal upset, and other issues. I was in and out of the emergency department. The craziest thing was my labs reflected something abnormal, which I called out to the staff—otherwise, it would have just gotten worse and worse,” he said.
Eventually, Shinaberry underwent surgery to remove his appendix and the tumor was discovered. At the time of surgery, Shinaberry’s lymphocyte count was 60,000 mL (normal range, 1000-4,800 mL). Just before this interview, Shinaberry was finally approved for treatment hematological conditions after he proved that it was service-connected.
Shinaberry realized he had a talent for reading through complicated documents and filling out paperwork. The experience of having to prove his medical disability has led to a second [unpaid] “career” for Shinaberry. “It all started with my mailman. I was in the reserves at the time and he saw me in uniform and said that he was also a veteran. He noticed that I was collecting benefits from the VA. I asked if he was also getting benefits, and he said no, he had been out for a long time. I told him he may be missing out on benefits he is owed and to call or knock on my door and we will sit down. He came over, I helped him look through all his documents. I did a brief physical, reviewed his laboratory reports, went through his prior military records, and doctor reports.” Shinaberry helped the mailman fill out his VA paperwork and he received 70% disability pay.
This success has led to Shinaberry helping many more veterans. He worked at University of South Florida in the Veterans Department helping people fill out paperwork to qualify for education benefits. “It just became a habit of mine. Just yesterday I helped another veteran that I met when I was on rotations and I put his paperwork in. He was exposed to radiation on a submarine that went supercritical and he never used [applied for disability]. So I told him that he would probably qualify for 100% disability based on all the conditions he has  developed. The VA says it’s an easy process but it’s not.”
It has been nice for Shinaberry to intertwine his military service, and knack for paperwork and computers, with wanting to help other veterans obtain the disability and educational benefits they deserve. “It feels like everything has led to this road,” he said.",Nikki Kean
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/photodistributed-blue-grey-macules/,Dermatologic Clinic: Photodistributed Blue-Grey Macules,"A 42-year-old Black woman with no significant past medical history presents with blue-gray macules on her neck and upper chest that gradually developed over the past year. She reports they are occasionally mildly itchy, but there are no other associated symptoms such as burning or pain. She reports no oral lesions or sores and did not start any new medications in the year prior to the onset of her skin findings. Biopsy of a lesion reveals a band-like inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermal-epidermal junction, basal keratinocyte vacuolar changes, and pigment incontinence and melanophages in the upper dermis.
Lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP) is an uncommon variant of lichen planus (LP) characterized by an insidious onset of brown, blue, or grey macules and patches in a symmetric distribution in sun-exposed skin.1 It was described as “lichens atypiques ou invisible pigmentogenes” in 1935 French medical literature, as “lichen pigmentosus” in 1956 Japanese medical literature, and finally as “lichen planus pigmentosus” in a 1974 case series of patients in India.2
Lichen planus pigmentosus occurs most commonly in middle-aged women with darker skin tones, specifically Fitzpatrick types III-VI.2 While it is a global disease, it is more prevalent in South Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.1 The etiology of LPP is unclear, but it has been associated with various comorbidities. Similarly to LP, its strongest association is with hepatitis C virus (HCV).1–3 Other common coexisting conditions include endocrine disorders (type 2 diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, and dyslipidemia) and autoimmune disorders (lupus erythematous and vitiligo).2,3 In a minority of cases, LPP occurs concurrently with other types of LP.1 In rare cases, LPP has been linked with head and neck malignancies, nephrotic syndrome, atopic dermatitis, and acrokeratosis of Bazex.2,3 Because of its prevalence among menopause-aged women, it has been theorized that hormones may play a role in LPP.2
The pathology of LPP is similar to LP in that it is a CD8+ T-lymphocyte-mediated cellular immune response that damages keratinocytes.1,2 This reaction is associated with ultraviolet (UV) exposure and the use of topical or oral photosensitizers, specifically mustard oil, amla oil, henna, hair dye, and turmeric.1–4
The disease is characterized by a slow onset of brown, blue, or greyish round to oval macules with irregular borders. These macules merge and progress to patches of hyperpigmentation, generally in a symmetric distribution. The photo-exposed areas of the face, neck, extremities, and occasionally flexures are most affected.1–4 Upper extremities are involved more than lower extremities. Unlike LP, LPP involvement of the oral mucosa, scalp, palms, soles, and nails is rare.2 The disease is generally asymptomatic aside from cosmetic concerns of patients, but some cases present with mild pruritis that represents a progression of the disease.2,4 During this active phase, macules may become erythematous.2
Histologically, LPP is characterized by lymphocytic inflammation in a band-like pattern at the dermal-epidermal junction with vacuolar destruction of the epidermal basal cell layer, or perivascular pattern. Older, inactive lesions have more predominant dermal melanophages and pigmentary incontinence.1,2,4
Diagnosis of LPP is generally based on clinical findings, but histologic evaluation can aid in diagnosis. LPP may present in various morphologies and configurations, including diffuse, blotchy, and reticular patterns. The most common clinical pattern of pigmentation is blotchy or diffuse.4 The disease can appear linearly along the lines of Blaschko.1,4 When LPP involves intertriginous areas, it is termed “LPP inversus” (LPPI).2,3 LPP does not enhance under Wood’s light.2 Direct immunofluorescence of LPP is rarely positive, but can show varying nonspecific findings such as IgM deposition in the papillary layer of the dermis.
The differential diagnosis for LPP includes erythema dyschromicum perstans (EDP), idiopathic eruptive macular pigmentation, fixed drug eruption, and post-inflammatory pigmentation (PIH).1–3 Erythema dyschromicum perstans, also known as “ashy dermatosis,” is sometimes categorized as a type of LP because of its similar clinical characteristics and histology.2,4 Both diseases present as a gradual onset of grey, brown, or blue macules and patches in a symmetric distribution; however, these 2 entities are often clinically distinguishable as EDP commonly involves the trunk and is seen in younger patients in the first to third decade.1,2,4 Histology of LPP and EDP both may show basal layer vacuolization, lichenoid or perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, and dermal pigmentary incontinence.1,2
Idiopathic eruptive macular pigmentation is characterized by brown to grey macules similar to LPP. However, unlike LPP, in this condition the macules characteristically begin in the trunk and spread to the proximal extremities. Idiopathic eruptive macular pigmentation tends to present in the first to third decade, earlier than the typical LPP onset.2
Fixed drug eruption (FDE) and PIH are generally differentiated from LPP using history and clinical features. Fixed drug eruption presents as a round, erythematous to hyperpigmented patch commonly on the face or genitals, which recurs in the same location each time the patient takes the offending medication. Patients with PIH have a history of inflammatory dermatosis in which the lesion becomes hyperpigmented as the initial insult heals.2
Treatment of LPP can be challenging and there is no consistently effective treatment option.3 All patients with LPP should be counseled to avoid triggers such as sun exposure and photosensitizers, and any underlying associated conditions should be addressed.2,3 To stabilize the progression of LPP, topical or oral immunomodulators are used; these include topical or systemic corticosteroids, topical or oral calcineurin inhibitors, and oral dapsone. For refractory cases, other treatments reported to benefit some patients include oral isotretinoin, Nd:YAG laser therapy, and phenol chemical peels.2,3,5
The patient in this case was advised to practice strict photoprotection and was started on a trial of topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Hepatitis C antibody testing was negative. As the lesions were persistent after topical therapy, she was then started on dapsone. Unfortunately, none of these treatments significantly improved her LPP.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/diabetes-and-pregnancy-cv-risk/,Diabetes and Pregnancy: Cardiovascular Risk Postpartum,"Along with an overall increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to men, CVD risk in women is further increased by factors related to reproductive stages and events.1 Those who experience gestational diabetes (GD) in pregnancy, for example, have a 2-fold increase in risk of developing CVD.2
In a recent meta-analysis of 38 studies with nearly 78 million total participants, subgroup analysis showed an increased risk for numerous types of CVD following GD, including heart failure (risk ratio [RR], 1.38; 1.17–1.62), arrhythmia (RR, 1.48; 1.46–1.50), coronary artery disease (RR, 1.53; 1.32–1.76), peripheral artery disease (RR, 2.00; 1.62–2.48), angina pectoris (RR, 2.03; 1.44–2.85), and ischemic stroke/TIA (RR, 1.52; 1.30–1.78), among others.3
In a meta-analysis published in March 2024 in Hypertension, Liu et al examined 15 cohort studies with more than 4 million participants and found an increased risk for hypertension after GD (pooled RR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.47-2.17) over 2 to 20 years of follow-up.4
A 2024 longitudinal study of records from 84,746 pregnancies reported an increased risk for new chronic hypertension (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.32–1.86) within 24 months postpartum in patients with GD compared to those without GD, and 28% of this effect was mediated through the development of diabetes mellitus.2
An earlier cohort study of 886,295 women demonstrated a 2.4-fold greater CVD risk in those with both gestational hypertensive disorder and GD compared to those with GD alone.5
In a study published in August 2024 in JACC: Advances (n=254), Minhas et al found a greater risk for adverse changes in cardiac structure and function as well as endothelial dysfunction within the decade after delivery in patients with prior GD, and some of these “risks may be mediated through the development of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes,” they wrote.6
“Because women with a history of GD are at high risk for the later development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), in the past it was not clear whether the increase in CV risk was due to GD itself or to the T2D that would develop afterwards,” said Jennifer Green, MD, professor of medicine in the division of endocrinology, metabolism, and nutrition at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, and faculty member in the Duke Clinical Research Institute. However, recent findings indicate that the CVD risk associated with GD remains even when normoglycemia is achieved after pregnancy.7
“The specific mechanisms are uncertain but thought to be related to metabolic derangements which cause cardiovascular dysfunction over time, similar to the link between T2D and CVD risk,” according to Lauren Hassen, MD, MPH, clinical assistant professor of internal medicine and clinical director of the Cardiology Postpartum Transition Clinic at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio. Patients with GD are also more likely to have co-existing CVD risk factors such as dyslipidemia and hypertension, she said.
Notably, Black women experience a disproportionate burden of GD and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia and increased maternal mortality rates,8,9 and they “often encounter barriers in accessing prenatal and postpartum care, exacerbating their risk for poor outcomes,” explained Rachel Bond, MD, system director of the Women’s Heart Health Program at Dignity Health in Gilbert, Arizona, and volunteer member of the American Heart Association’s (AHA) Postpartum System of Care Writing Group.10
“It may be very important to identify CV risk factors such as hypertension in women who are not yet pregnant, so that their risk for both GD and later CVD can be addressed at earlier stages through preconceptual counseling or other interventions,” Dr Green said.11
For those who develop GD during pregnancy, “Frequent screening for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension in the years after delivery is important so the modifiable CVD risk factors can be diagnosed and treated promptly,” Dr Hassen said.12 “Lifestyle changes to help reduce CVD risk, such as regular exercise and a heart-healthy diet, should be discussed and encouraged.”
Some patients may require medications to control blood pressure or cholesterol, Dr Bond added.
She pointed to several challenges in preventing CVD in patients who experience GD, including a lack of awareness among many patients and providers regarding the link between GD and CVD. Accordingly, some patients may not realize they have a heightened risk for CVD following GD and thus may not prioritize follow-up care and healthy lifestyle changes.
“Busy schedules or limited access to health care can also make it hard for these patients to stay on top of preventive care,” Dr Bond said. “Overcoming these barriers requires raising awareness and ensuring that these women have access to ongoing medical support and guidance.”
Patients with both GD and pre-existing CVD present additional challenges, including limited treatment options.
“Treatment must be carefully balanced for these patients, especially during pregnancy and breastfeeding,” Dr Bond advised. “While managing blood sugar is crucial to prevent complications, certain medications like SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have cardiovascular benefits, are contraindicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.” The potential risks that these medications pose to the infant limits their use in women with GD, she said.
In addition to essential lifestyles interventions to optimize glucose control and CV health in pregnancy, GD treatment typically involves insulin therapy or metformin, Dr Bond continued. “Blood sugar control through careful monitoring and dietary adjustments is key, alongside managing cardiovascular risk factors, and ongoing care and collaboration between obstetricians, endocrinologists, and cardiologists are required to provide safe and effective treatment tailored to the mother’s changing health needs.”
Reducing the risk for GD and the associated risk for CVD warrants continued efforts in multiple areas. Efforts to increase provider awareness about the GD-CVD connection represent a key need in improving patient education and treatment regarding this risk.
“Health care clinicians must be trained to recognize and address the early risk factors for GD and CVD, particularly in Black women, who are often underrepresented in clinical trials and may not receive the same level of care,” Dr Bond stated. “Improving clinician awareness and competency in delivering culturally appropriate care is critical for closing these gaps.”
Along with a focus on greater clinician education, the AHA’s Advancing Maternal Health Equity initiative “recommends ensuring that health care systems offer equitable, evidence-based care and that Black women are empowered with the knowledge and resources to manage their health,” Dr Bond said.13
She also noted the pressing need for research exploring the social, genetic, and environmental factors driving racial disparities in GD.
Dr Hassen cited the need for the development of novel targeted therapies to reduce risk during the interval between delivery and a subsequent CVD event. “This crucial window of opportunity is quite short, as the increased risk of CVD has been demonstrated within the first decade after delivery.”11
According to Dr Duke, studies currently underway are expected to shed further light on the link between GD and CV events occurring later in life. “As prevention of these conditions would be preferable, additional investigation of methods to promote lifestyle modification or other interventions to reduce the risk of GD itself will be important.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/covid-epidemic-changed-my-lens-from-red-to-blue/,Opinion: The COVID-19 Epidemic Has Changed My Lens From Red to Blue,"As a family nurse practitioner in a community health clinic, I encounter health disparities among the patients I serve. I have always been a patient advocate and continually search for resources for my patient population. I am also a self-made financial contributor to my nation’s economy. Being raised by a staunch Republican father, I saw the economy through my father’s Republican lens. Although a self-declared Independent, politically, I often voted Republican. I thought the Republican party would protect my ability to save money and be prosperous. It took a pandemic to change my mind.
I recall the first day that the COVID-19 epidemic shook me. I was working at an urgent care facility in March, 2020. At that time, no one was wearing a protective mask. The hospital provided me with one mask to reuse. A patient had been put into one of my rooms with “knee pain.” I always looked at the patient’s vital signs before entering a room and his were within normal range. I walk into the tiny examination room and close the door behind me.
The elderly gentleman was lying down on the exam table, which is often an ominous sign. I asked if his knee hurt and he said his whole body hurt. I asked him to wait a minute and I exited the room. After applying hand sanitizer, I asked the nurse to take his temperature and it was 103°. I went back into the room, examined the patient, who was coughing, and from across the room, I informed him that he could have COVID-19. He wanted to know for sure but there were no tests at that time and I diagnosed him with Presumptive COVID-19. I instructed him to go home, quarantine, and follow the Centers for Disease Control Guidelines. He started to cry and said he was scared―I was scared too.
I collect Christmas gifts for family all year and have a gift closet. I went home that day and wrapped all the gifts I had purchased and put name tags on them so that if I died from COVID-19, the gifts would have name tags. I didn’t get sick and felt so lucky to have dodged a bullet. My housekeeper was not so lucky. I was home on the June day when she came to clean my house. I stayed upstairs while she cleaned downstairs and vice versa. This was the last time I saw her. I was informed that her husband had been ill with Presumptive COVID-19 and she became ill. She went into the hospital and died.
I was in disbelief over the attitudes of those I grew up with, my contemporaries. Here I was going to work, diagnosing COVID-19, and taking my mother to dialysis. My mother, who is in her nineties, was living in an assisted living facility that closed their doors for visits from family members to prevent illness. Thankfully, they drove her to dialysis twice a week, and I drove on Saturdays. I was very careful, I double-masked, wore gloves, did not get in her face, and [lived in] fear I would somehow get her sick.
Meanwhile, people were saying that COVID wasn’t real and not wearing masks was an act of defiance. This was a hard time for me. On the one hand, I am a health care worker thrown in the midst of the pandemic. On the other hand, I am a citizen trying to keep my elderly mother safe.
It was at this time, the political tables turned for me. I was no longer in the center of a bubble looking outward; I was an outsider looking inward in disbelief. I now had a full understanding of where Hamlet was coming from when he famously observed the world as a stage and people actors. I posted a meme on Facebook about being considerate of others by wearing a mask and I received so many horrible messages from people with absurd notions. It seemed people would rather believe a conspiracy than the obvious truth.
The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people with limited competence in a particular domain overestimate their abilities. It was first described by Justin Kruger and David Dunning in 1999. I believe this is what America suffers from, as evidenced by a multitude of unsubstantiated theories on the pandemic. The worst offenders are those in the medical profession who perpetuate false notions about the pandemic. There are, after all, quacks in every profession. The quacks in the medical profession were those who boast of going to Ivy League schools and prescribing an antiparasitic, for a fee I might add, for a respiratory virus, despite warnings from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) against its use.
I felt for Anthony Fauci, MD, who had an impressive career and was a notable advocate for community health. Dr Fauci has saved countless lives over the years during his tenure. [Yet he was being discredited in the media.] Of course, those who did not go to any medical school believe they know more about COVID-19 because someone on Facebook said so.
I’m over it. For the first time since this all started, I am clear on where I stand. I stand with the truth. Had President Trump taken a more intelligent route and listened to the experts, the outcome [of the COVID-19 pandemic] would have undoubtedly been better.
My vote for 2024 is Blue.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/drugs-for-tardive-dyskinesia/,Tardive Dyskinesia Management: Treatment Strategies and Recommendations,"Our easy-to-read fact sheets provide clinicians with reliable information to share with patients and their caregivers.
Tardive dyskinesia is a condition defined by delayed (tardive) involuntary movements of the body (dyskinesia) that often occur after the short- and long-term use of certain medications designed to block dopamine. These medications are usually prescribed for mental health or stomach issues.1 When a patient stops taking the culpable medication, symptoms may persist. Involuntary movements may involve muscles in the face, neck, arms, and legs. Common symptoms include difficulty swallowing, frequent blinking, and jerking movements of the hands and legs. Patients may also experience uncontrollable movements of the tongue.1
Approximately 20% of people who take certain older antipsychotic medications may develop tardive dyskinesia; however, it is difficult to know how common tardive dyskinesia is because there aren’t many studies on other medications that may induce the condition. Although it is not fully understood why some patients develop tardive dyskinesia and others don’t, the condition is known to be more prevalent among women (particularly those who have gone through menopause), older adults (aged ≥65), and those of African descent.1
Older (ie, first-generation) vs newer (ie, atypical or second-generation) antipsychotics are more likely to induce tardive dyskinesia because they more strongly affect dopamine as opposed to serotonin.
These antipsychotic medications, also known as neuroleptics, are often used to treat conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.2 Some medications that treat stomach-related issues (ie, nausea, acid reflux) can also trigger tardive dyskinesia if taken for more than 3 months.2 A list of potential tardive dyskinesia-inducing medications are listed in Table 1.
If your health care provider (HCP) finds that a specific medication is inducing tardive dyskinesia, they may suggest lowering the dose or ceasing the medication altogether. This can help reduce or eliminate involuntary movement.3
In rare cases, an HCP may recommend alternative interventions, such as:
Tardive dyskinesia can be tricky to diagnose because symptoms may not manifest until months, or even years after initiating an antipsychotic medicine. Sometimes symptoms might not even appear until after you have already stopped taking the drug. This can make it difficult to discern whether the drug even induced the symptoms. To evaluate any unusual movements, an HCP should use the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Blood tests and brain scans (ie, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) may also be used to rule out other conditions that can cause similar involuntary movements (ie, Huntington disease, Parkinson disease).1
If tardive dyskinesia is caught early, ceasing use of the medication that induced the condition may reduce or reverse symptoms. It is important, however, that patients understand that even if medication use is stopped, some patients may still experience involuntary movements and these involuntary movements may actually worsen with time.7
When taking antipsychotic medications, it is important to maintain regular check-ups so as to earlier identify signs of tardive dyskinesia. If possible, consider requesting newer second-generation antipsychotics, which are typically associated with a lower risk for tardive dyskinesia. If you notice any unusual movements while taking these medications, be sure to immediately inform your HCP. 7
Most people develop tardive dyskinesia after taking antipsychotic medications for several months or years. Some individuals, however, especially older patients, may notice symptoms within a few weeks or months of starting the medication. Those at higher risk of developing tardive dyskinesia early on include older patients and those prescribed high doses of drugs that block dopamine. It is important to monitor symptoms, regardless of when they appear.7
Your current medications may need to be adjusted in terms of the dosage prescribed. Alternatively, your HCP may suggest switching to a different medication that is associated with a lower risk for tardive dyskinesia.7

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/stepwise-approach-diagnosis-and-management-of-endometriosis/,A Stepwise Approach to Diagnosis and Management of Endometriosis,"Endometriosis, a condition in which endometrial cells are found outside of the uterine lining, affects 2% to 10% of women of reproductive age.1 It is a debilitating disorder affecting an individual’s independence and ability to perform activities of daily living. Common symptoms of endometriosis include severe pelvic pain, menorrhagia, bowel changes during menses, anxiety, depression, dyspareunia, and prolonged premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Endometriosis pain can lead to syncopal episodes and the excessive bleeding can cause severe chronic anemia.
Although the pathogenesis of the endometriosis is not fully understood, one theory is that during cell growth and division, stem cells from organs throughout the body, including the fallopian tubes, ovaries, intestines, and lungs, improperly differentiate and become endometrial cells.2 Another commonly held theory is “retrograde menstruation” during which the retrograde flow occurs during menstruation and results in endometrial cells flowing back through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvis. In women with endometriosis, this retrograde menstruation can trigger pro-inflammatory responses and inflammation due to the entrance of macrophages into the pelvic cavity.3
During a normally functioning follicular phase, increasing levels of estrogen cause a thickening of the endometrium, with the largest growth occurring just before ovulation. After ovulation, the corpus luteum begins to secrete progesterone. If the ovum is not fertilized, the corpus luteum breaks down and ceases its production of progesterone, and the endometrium begins to shed.4 In individuals with endometriosis, inflammation and bleeding can occur in all endometrial cells, wherever they are in the body, in response to this estrogen stimulation and progesterone withdrawal.The pain from endometriosis is caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines and the increase of inflammatory cells within endometrial growths as well as by estrogen-mediated peripheral sensory neuronal dysfunction.5 Endometriotic lesions can create hormonal imbalances from increased estrogen synthesis and progesterone resistance.6
Endometriosis is of importance to many practitioners, not just those focused on women’s health.  For example, mental health practitioners see increased rates of anxiety and depression in patients with endometriosis. Primary care practitioners, including  pediatricians, are often the first to hear of endometriosis-related symptomatology because some patients begin experiencing symptoms as early as menarche. The severe pain, excessive bleeding, and other clinical manifestations of the condition may necessitate emergency blood transfusions and referral to a specialist for work-up of syncope. Complications can arise in almost any part of the body as seen with endometriotic lesions that can grow within the lungs and lead to pneumothoraces during menses. In addition, these complications can sometimes manifest as symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome.8 Endometriosis can also cause ectopic pregnancies when fertilized embryos get stuck within scarred, fibrous fallopian tubes.9 All types of clinicians, regardless of specialty, likely will encounter patients with endometriosis and, therefore, it is of utmost importance for the entire medical community to recognize its symptomatology and have knowledge about the best management of this disease process.
Although surgery is required for definitive diagnosis of endometriosis, patient presentation can allow for preliminary clinical diagnosis. Globally, it takes an average of 7 to 9 years after symptom onset for endometriosis to be  diagnosed.9 In the United States, on average, women will undergo debilitating symptoms for 10 years before receiving a diagnosis.9
The lack of a gold standard staging system has been one of the barriers to the diagnosis of endometriosis leading to miscommunication among providers and suboptimal treatment.9 One globally accepted staging system, the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine Classification (rASRM), is widely used but has many disadvantages, including poor reproducibility,10 a lack of correlation between rASRM stage, the severity of pain/infertility,11 and the exclusion of deep infiltrative endometriosis. Another system, the ENZIAN classification, does classify deep infiltrative endometriosis but has poor international acceptance and varying scores if surgery is performed incompletely.9 The endometriosis fertility index more accurately predicts pregnancy outcomes of those with surgically documented endometriosis, but it is another system that does not correlate with pain, varies by surgeon, and involves further calculations than the other classification systems.9
To address some of these issues, in 2021 the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL) issued a new classification system for endometriosis that correlates scores with dyschezia, total pain, infertility, and dysmenorrhea.12 This scoring system combines benefits of the previously established scoring systems and eliminates many of their drawbacks.
The AAGL staging system is especially helpful for tailoring patient treatment and predicting further complications, but it requires surgery to be performed.12 Clinicians need to determine whether endometriosis is likely in order to properly refer a patient for gynecologic laparoscopy. Research supports assessing the likelihood and severity of endometriosis via a patient questionnaire.12
Chapron et al reported on the following validated measures to reliably predict endometriosis12:
Patient questionnaires can establish a baseline for diagnosing endometriosis,  yielding earlier identification and intervention. Such questionnaires also facilitate referral for diagnostic and therapeutic surgery for patients with more severe symptomatology and a higher likelihood of endometriosis.
Many providers are quick to treat endometriosis symptomatically. If the inflammation, bleeding, and pain are caused by estrogen and progesterone fluctuations, suppressing these fluctuations with exogenous hormonal therapy (ie, OCPs) can offer symptom relief to patients. However, this treatment approach may not be the most effective means of treating endometriosis. As clinicians, we must consider all treatment options, weighing the risks and benefits with informed consent and input from our patients especially regarding their quality of life, to identify the best treatment plan for each patient. Prescribing OCPs has become so commonplace in medical practice that when patients present with dysmenorrhea and/or menorrhagia, they are so desperate for symptom relief that they often don’t give the many years of natural cycle suppression a second thought. However, research has shown that patients taking OCPs are at a higher risk for pulmonary emboli, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cervical and breast cancers.13 If patients are started on OCPs for management of endometriosis symptoms during their early teen years, and they continue these medications for 20 to 30 years, the risks can be substantial.
In addition, OCPs do not eliminate the ectopic endometrial growth. Endometriosis can implant within and around the fallopian tubes and ovaries, which can directly affect fertility. If mainstay treatment continues to be cycle suppression through OCPs, when patients decide they would like to conceive, they will likely encounter challenges including infertility, failed implantation, and other possible complications. Complications can include ectopic pregnancies and recurrent spontaneous abortion.13
Many vitamins and supplements have been associated with improvement in symptomatology and reduction in the severity of endometriosis.14 Supplementation of vitamin D can be especially helpful for women with endometriosis because of vitamin D’s anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.14 In addition, vitamin D decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases anti-inflammatory cytokines.14 Magnesium offers many benefits to women suffering from endometriosis as well. The fallopian tubes contract irregularly and more spasmodically in those with endometriosis, and magnesium relaxes smooth muscles,15
Supplementation with fish oil was associated with a 50% drop in visual analog scale  scores in adolescents with endometriosis.16 Vitamin E deficiency has been correlated with endometriosis severity.17 Vitamin B6 can alter gene expression, resulting in a decrease in the risk of developing endometriosis.18 In addition, vitamin B6 can assist in controlling endometriosis, reducing its severity.19 Vitamin B12 supplementation has been shown to result in a significant decrease in menstrual pain.20 These natural hormones, vitamins, and supplements can be a less invasive option for managing milder cases of endometriosis.
Because of the inflammatory nature of endometriosis, adopting an anti-inflammatory diet has been discussed as a treatment option for patients as well.20 According to the Nurses’ Health Study II, a low-glycemic index diet has been associated with a reduction in the risk for endometriosis.21 This study also found that consuming 2 or more servings of red meat per day compared with less than 1 serving per week was associated with a 56% greater risk for endometriosis.22 Another study found that patients eating a low fat-plant based vegan diet had a larger increase in anti-inflammatory compounds within the microbiome than did those eating an omnivorous diet; this larger increase was associated with a reduction in dysmenorrhea.23 Based on these studies, anti-inflammatory diets appear  helpful in reducing endometriosis and dysmenorrhea.
Many of the symptoms of endometriosis (anxiety, depression, PMS symptoms) have been linked to low progesterone occurring prematurely in the luteal phase. Replacing progesterone exogenously after ovulation through naturally formulated biochemically identical progesterone can reduce many of these symptoms, with fewer potential side effects compared with OCPs. Progesterone replacement is helpful in altering estrogen receptors, inhibiting angiogenesis, and reducing the building block of endometriotic implantation by decreasing expression of metalloproteinases.24 In addition, many patients experience less cramping while taking exogenous progesterone.
Considering the increases in nonspecific inflammatory markers, systemic immune responses, widespread inflammation, and incidence of other immune disorders associated with endometriosis, the disease could be considered an immune disorder.25 Treatments that can suppress the immunologic response of endometriosis have shown promise. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) has been used to treat multiple gynecologic disorders, including endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). The treatment stimulates endorphin release, modulates the function of immune cells, and suppresses the proliferation of CD4 and CD8 cells.25  In addition, naltrexone improves ovulation stimulation by anti-estrogens, yielding a reduction in symptoms without compromising fertility.25 Another study showed that use of transient prednisolone from the 3rd day of the menstrual cycle for approximately 12 days in women with endometriosis who have positive auto-antibodies resulted in an 80% pregnancy rate than those who did not take prednisolone.25
Many patients, however, especially those with more severe cases of endometriosis,  require laparoscopic surgical excision, one of the most common, safe and cost-effective surgeries used to treat endometriosis26.A retrospective study of patients who underwent laparoscopic endometriosis removal and pelvic pain surgery from 2010 to 2015 found that 80% of previously infertile patients who attempted conception were successful.27This study also showed that the reoperation rate for patients was only 8.6%. A prospective study with follow-up 2 to 5 years after laparoscopic excision of endometriosis found that pain scores for dysmenorrhea, dyschezia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain all were reduced significantly.28 This study also found “an increase in the quality of life, improved sexual function with pleasure, and a decrease in discomfort among these patients.”28 These positive outcomes underscore why laparoscopic excision of endometriosis remains central to the  management for many patients.
Although the cost, risks involved with surgery, and unforeseen complications are important parts of the discussion of whether surgical intervention is the best course of action for patients with endometriosis, research demonstrates that the best overall outcomes and symptom relief are associated with surgical intervention. If interventions can occur earlier, patients will suffer less and benefit for longer. The earlier these surgical interventions occur, the longer patients can live symptom-free before menopause naturally ceases their disabling pain. In addition, earlier surgical intervention will lead to increased potential for fertility. Removing fibrous tissue within the ovaries, fimbriae, and fallopian tubes can allow the body to fulfill a natural cycle more effectively. In addition to surgery, hormonal assistance via naturally occurring progesterone to make up for low progesterone levels (which, as discussed earlier, is often present in patients with endometriosis), can improve patients’ ability to successfully carry pregnancies.
Research supports surgery as the best diagnostic and treatment approach, but it is not always feasible. The cost of surgical evaluation and management may be prohibitive for some. Many Americans remain uninsured or underinsured, resulting in large out-of-pocket costs, as well as the financial burden of time away from work for treatment and postoperative recovery. Language barriers, limitations in mobility, and residency in rural communities without availability of laparoscopic surgery can be additional barriers to surgery.
Collaboration across disciplines and specialties is important to assist patients in overcoming these barriers. Connecting patients to resources where fees are based on a sliding scale, providing information about marketplace health insurance options, conducting outreach to rural areas, and providing educational videos and resources in a variety of languages are tangible ways to reduce barriers to accessible care for patients with endometriosis.  One potential solution is providing laparoscopic surgery to pediatric patients, who tend to recover more quickly than adults.  In addition, patients who are still in school have time off during summers to recover from surgery, which decreases the potential financial burden compared with adults needing time off from work. Pediatric patients often are insured as dependents on their parents’ health insurance or through CHIP-Medicaid, which could minimize some financial barriers to patient care. Earlier surgical intervention also decreases the long-term cost of complications secondary to endometriosis, such as emergency services, blood transfusions, time off from work, and infertility.
Overall, a proposed stepwise approach is the most effective methodological approach to treating patients with endometriosis. It is our duty as clinicians to improve the lives of our patients in severe pain. Recognizing the symptomatology of endometriosis and maintaining a collaborative approach connecting patients to trained and skilled endometriosis-specialized surgeons will provide patients with the best outcomes.","Elizabeth Mussalli, PA-C; Louise Lee, EdD, MHA, CHSE, PA-C"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/fighting-antibiotic-resistance-at-the-source-using-machine-learning-to-identify-bacterial-resistance-genes-and-drugs-to-block-them/,Fighting Antibiotic Resistance at the Source – Using Machine Learning to Identify Bacterial Resistance Genes and Drugs to Block Them,"The Conversation — Antibiotic resistance is a growing public health problem around the world. When bacteria like Escherichia coli no longer respond to antibiotics, infections become harder to treat.
To develop new antibiotics, researchers typically identify the genes that make bacteria resistant. Through laboratory experiments, they observe how bacteria respond to different antibiotics and look for mutations in the genetic makeup of resistant strains that allow them to survive.
While effective, this method can be time-consuming and may not always capture the full picture of how bacteria become resistant. For example, changes in how genes work that don’t involve mutations can still influence resistance. Bacteria can also exchange resistance genes between each other, which may not be detected if only focusing on mutations within a single strain.
My colleagues and I developed a new approach to identify E coli resistance genes by computer modeling, allowing us to design new compounds that can block these genes and make existing treatments more effective.
To predict which genes contribute to resistance, we analyzed the genomes of various E coli strains to identify genetic patterns and markers associated with resistance. We then used machine learning algorithms trained on existing data to highlight novel genes or mutations shared across resistant strains that might contribute to resistance.
After identifying resistance genes, we designed inhibitors that specifically target and block the proteins these genes produce. By analyzing the structure of the proteins these genes code for, we were able to optimize our inhibitors to strongly bind to these specific proteins.
To reduce the likelihood that bacteria would evolve resistance to these inhibitors, we targeted regions of their genome that code for proteins critical to their survival. By interfering with how bacteria carry out important functions, it makes it more difficult for them to develop mechanisms to compensate. We also prioritized compounds that work differently from existing antibiotics to minimize cross-resistance.
Finally, we tested how effectively our inhibitors could overcome antibiotic resistance in E. coli. We used computer simulations to assess how strongly a number of inhibitors bind to target proteins over time. One inhibitor called hesperidin was able to strongly bind to the three genes in E. coli involved in resistance that we identified, suggesting it may be able to help combat antibiotic-resistant strains.
The World Health Organization ranks antimicrobial resistance as one of the top 10 threats to global health. In 2019, bacterial antibiotic resistance killed an estimated 4.95 million people worldwide.
By targeting the specific genes responsible for resistance to existing drugs, our approach could lead to treatments for challenging bacterial infections that are not only more effective but also less likely to contribute to further resistance. It can also help researchers keep up with bacterial threats as they evolve. Some microbes can transfer resistance to other microbes.
Our predictive approach could be adapted to other bacterial strains, allowing for more personalized treatment strategies. In the future, doctors could potentially tailor antibiotic treatments based on the specific genetic makeup of the bacteria causing the infection, potentially leading to better outcomes.
As antibiotic resistance continues to rise globally, our findings may provide a crucial tool in the fight against this threat. Further development is needed before our methods can be used in the clinic. However, by staying ahead of bacterial evolution, targeted inhibitors could help preserve the efficacy of existing antibiotics and reduce the spread of resistant strains.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/halloween-candy-binges-can-overload-your-gut-microbiome-how-to-minimize-spooking-your-helpful-bacteria/,Halloween Candy Binges Can Overload Your Gut Microbiome – How to Minimize Spooking Your Helpful Bacteria,"The Conversation — Each October, as the days shorten and the air grows crisp, millions of Americans prepare for the beloved – and often sugar-fueled – tradition of Halloween. From jack-o’-lanterns glowing on porches to costumes ranging from the whimsical to the gory, Halloween is a time of playful scares, childhood memories and, of course, candy.
But as the wrappers pile up and the sugar rush hits, there’s something far more sinister brewing beneath the surface: the negative effects of candy on your gut health.
Sugar and other ingredients in Halloween treats can cast a sickly spell on the trillions of microorganisms that reside in your gut, collectively known as the gut microbiome. As a gastroenterologist and gut microbiome researcher at the University of Washington School of Medicine, I have dedicated my career to decoding the cipher of how food affects this microbial community within your gut.
While no candy is truly healthy, some options are better for your gut than others. And there are ways you can help wake your gut from its sugar “spell” after holiday indulgence.
What does all this candy do to your gut?
In a healthy state, your gut microbiome acts like a microbial factory. It digests nutrients your body can’t – such as fiber and colorful, health-conferring plant compounds called polyphenols – and produces important molecules called metabolites that protect against infection and support brain health. It also regulates metabolism, or the transformation of food into useful components that power and grow cells.
A balanced diet keeps your gut’s microbial cauldron churning smoothly. But the concentrated sugar, saturated fat and additives in candy can throw things into disarray by feeding inflammatory microbes that weaken your gut barrier – the protective lining that separates your microbiome from the rest of the body.
Once the gut barrier is breached, even friendly microbes can stir up inflammation, causing health issues ranging from overweight to obesity, infections to autoimmune disease, and mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s.
Sugar and inflammation impair your microbiome’s ability to digest food and regulate metabolism. Instead of producing healthy byproducts – such as butyrate from fiber and urolithin A from polyphenols – candy lacking these nutrients may trick your system into storing more fat, providing less energy for your muscles and brain.
Too much candy can also affect your immune system. A healthy gut microbiome helps your immune system distinguish between friend and foe, reducing the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders. Sugar and inflammation undermine the microbiome’s role in training the immune system to distinguish between harmful invaders and harmless substances. Without a carefully calibrated immune system, your body may not effectively clear infections or may strongly react to its own cells.
Neurologically, excess sweets can also affect the gut-brain axis, the 2-way communication between the gut and brain. A healthy microbiome normally produces neurotransmitters and metabolites, such as serotonin and butyrate, that influence mood and cognitive performance. Sugar and inflammation adversely affects the microbiome’s role in mental health and cognitive function, contributing to depression, anxiety and memory troubles.
Not all Halloween treats are created equal, especially when it comes to their nutritional value and effects on gut health. Sugar-coated nuts and fruit such as honey-roasted almonds and candy apples rank among the top, offering whole food benefits just beneath the sugary coating. Packed with fiber and polyphenols, they help support gut health and healthy metabolism.
On the opposite end of the spectrum are chewy treats such as candy corn, Skittles, Starbursts and Twizzlers. These sugar-laden confections are mostly made of high fructose corn syrup, saturated fat and additives. They can increase the unsavory bacterial species in your gut and lead to inflammation, making them one of the least healthy Halloween choices.
Chocolate-based candies, however, stand out as a more microbiome-friendly option. While varieties such as Twix, Three Musketeers and Milky Way contain only a small amount of chocolate, pure chocolate bars – especially dark chocolate – are rich in fiber and polyphenols. In moderation, dark chocolate with at least 80% to 85% cacao may even benefit your gut microbiome and mood by encouraging beneficial bacterial species to grow.
Chocolates with whole nuts, such as almonds or peanuts, offer a boost of fiber, protein and omega-3 fats, making them a healthier choice. Dark chocolate with nuts is best. But when sorting through Halloween treats, Peanut M&Ms, 100 Grands and Almond Joys may be better options over Rolos, Krackels and Crunches. Even candies with processed nuts, such as Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups and Butterfingers, retain small amounts of fiber and protein, making them preferable to nut-free options.
At the bottom of the list, along with chewy sugar candies, are pure sugar candies such as lollipops, Jolly Ranchers, gummies and Smarties. These sweets lack nutritional value, and their high sugar content can contribute to the growth of unhealthy bacteria in your gut microbiome.
In the end, all candies are high in sugar, which can be harmful when consumed in large quantities. Moderation and an otherwise balanced diet is key to enjoying Halloween treats.
If the microbiome is critical for health, and candy can disrupt its balance, how can you restore gut health after Halloween?
One simple strategy is focusing on the four F’s of food: fiber, phytochemicals, unsaturated fats and fermented foods. These food components can help support gut health.
Fiber-rich foods such as whole grains, nuts, seeds, beans, fruits and vegetables regulate digestion and nourish beneficial gut bacteria.
Polyphenol-rich foods such as dark chocolate, berries, red grapes, green tea and extra virgin olive oil help reduce inflammation and encourage the growth of healthy gut bacteria.
Unsaturated fats such as omega-3 fats, walnuts, chia seeds, flaxseed, avocados and fatty fish such as salmon can also support a healthy microbiome.
Fermented foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt, kefir and miso help replenish beneficial bacteria and restore gut balance.
To make tracking your diet easier, consider using a food calculator to measure how well your meals align with the four F’s and microbiome friendly options. Like a virtual “spellbook,” an online tool can help ensure your food choices support your gut health and ward off the effects of sugar overload.
As my daughters often remind me, it’s perfectly fine to indulge every now and then in a few tricks and treats. But remember, moderation is key. With a balanced diet, you’ll keep your gut healthy and strong long after the Halloween season ends.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/what-is-narrative-medicine/,What Is Narrative Medicine? Finding Humanity in Health Care,"Health care requires humanity.
At its roots, narrative medicine embodies this ideology. Coined in 2000 by internist and scholar Rita Charon, MD, PhD, the field is “medicine practiced with the narrative competence to recognize, interpret, and be moved to action by the predicament of others.”1
Without specific examples, however, narrative medicine can slip into a vague, abstract practice within the cultural consciousness. After all, the field is bolstered by philosophers such as Judith Butler, Emmanuel Levinas, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty — the likes of whom may leave anybody wondering: what does all this talk about “identity” and “self” have to do with medicine?
In short, it has everything to do with medicine. The longer answer, on the other hand, requires a bit more deconstruction.
Narrative medicine is less a specific practice and more a theoretical framework that equips caregivers and health care professionals with tools to provide more holistic care. These tools stem from storytelling principles and literature, which can hone our empathic and listening skills.
But how does literature inform medicine?
Craig Irvine, PhD, a co-founder of the Master’s in Narrative Medicine program at Columbia University, puts it this way: “Literature honors medicine’s imperative to clothe the naked. Making the Other an object of reflection, literature mirrors medicine’s thematization, its bringing to light — its way of knowing.”2
In other words, medicine is founded upon a responsibility to alleviate the suffering of the “Other,” or the patient who is separate from the “I.” Just as literature provides a platform for the reader to interpret the “Other’s” experience, the goal of medicine is to comprehend and remedy the suffering of the patient.
Dr Irvine takes heavily from Levinas, who “places science and art on parallel representational planes.” Literature is representational, in that we will read a novel and become immersed in the reality of its characters; yet, we simultaneously understand that a story paints only one picture of humanity that each reader will interpret differently. We can thus critically conceptualize medicine in the same vein.
“Seeming alien to medicine, literature represents the unrepresentability of its infinite distance from the Other,” Irvine posits.
When we read a novel and become infused with the truths of a story, we acknowledge that this story is not reflective of the entire human experience. Likewise, we can practice medicine by honing into the unique experiences of a patient while also accepting that this exchange is multifaceted and impossible to condense into words.
Considering this dynamic between patient and provider, Sayantani DasGupta, MD, MPH’s concept of “narrative humility” offers a new way of thinking.3 At its core, narrative humility acknowledges the shortcomings of medicine and seeks a different route. The provider will never be able to completely understand a patient’s experience, regardless of the depth of their training. We are human — universal yet undefinable. And that’s okay.
Medical schools across the country are increasingly tailoring their curricula to include humanities-focused aspects, which may require medical students to attend narrative medicine workshops facilitated by narrative medicine practitioners.4
“I always think of [narrative medicine] as 2 things,” says Eve Makoff, MD, MS, Regional Medical Director of the AltaMed Health Services PACE Program, a government-funded program for low-income geriatric patients.
“One is a way of being as a clinician — and it doesn’t necessarily have to be a doctor but any kind of health care provider in an encounter with a patient. It’s sort of an open stance — a way of listening, a way of attending. But it’s also this sort of pedagogical workshop method that we’re taught…to help health care providers become narrative medicine informed providers in the clinic.”
A fundamental narrative medicine workshop is called a close reading workshop, in which a facilitator provides a medium — a piece of writing, a painting, a song, or even a video — and encourages participants to first analyze the medium. The participants will then share their observations with each other before the facilitator provides a writing prompt for a 5-minute reflection exercise.
As a result of these workshops, participants hone their listening and analytical skills. Moreover, we learn to slow down and absorb the medium in its entirety — the speaker’s point of view, the implications behind each word choice, the backdrop of a painting that eluded the perceiver’s eyes at first glance.
According to Charon and colleagues,
“The goal of this work, ultimately, is for learners to achieve a state of attentive and empathic affiliation with a patient, born of their efforts to represent what they perceive, to seek the necessary perspectives beyond their own, to register that which is mysterious or unclear, to wonder about the mysterious, to ask questions about the unclear, to generate hypotheses about the patient’s situation, and to test those hypotheses in the growing affiliation with the patient.”5
In other words, the workshop refines our ability to perceive. It prepares us to become closer to the patient.
In a clinical setting, the workshop method is a practice in attention.
As rapidly developing technology transforms our health care spaces, attention has become all the more valuable. “We’ve also really lost a face-to-face piece of our encounter with patients and families,” Dr Makoff says. “The way that I model what narrative medicine teaches us… is a kind of attention that notices, which you can’t do with a screen in front of your face.”
Each clinical encounter can be viewed as an exchange of stories. The clinician can either condense the patient’s narrative into a list of symptoms (each necessitating a pharmaceutical to alleviate one’s suffering), or recognize that much like a piece of literature, the physician’s reading of a patient — and the patient’s truth — cannot be captured by an electronic health record.
For example, a patient who suffers from chronic illness may embody a constellation of symptoms that don’t quite fit the currently established guidelines for care. Narrative medicine is a potential framework for mediating this dilemma.
Detailing her own experience conducting a narrative medicine intervention among patients with advanced-stage cancer, Dr Makoff recalls, “I would go and sit with them when they were having their chemotherapy infusions and we would read a poem, look at a painting, read a graphic strip. We would talk about it. We would close read. I would make them slow down and go back…and then we would write together and read each other’s writing. I themed the sessions in uplifting ways — finding joy, or making meaning or identity outside of cancer.”
Dr Makoff’s example of an intervention with patients with cancer is by no means the remedial substitute for chemotherapy. However, from a palliative care perspective, much can be said about how the patients reacted to this experience.
“Interestingly, one of the major things they said was that it made them more empathic,” she recalls. “It made them recognize different perspectives. It also made them realize they had more life to live regardless of their prognosis.”
Ultimately, the experience was an “opportunity for them to become narrative medicine experts themselves and to apply it to their own life and healing.” Through narrative medicine practices, patients can become equipped with the skills and awareness to facilitate their own care.
Other applications of narrative medicine and storytelling techniques have also demonstrated promise within the clinic. In the first randomized controlled trial that evaluated a narrative skills intervention in group educational sessions for the management of type 2 diabetes, patients participated in either a close reading and creative writing approach or a classic educational approach.6
Compared with the usual care group, the narrative intervention group demonstrated not only noninferior reductions in glycated hemoglobin levels, but also increased satisfaction with the therapist and group process.
In another randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03766438), a digital storytelling intervention, compared with usual care, was associated with improved glycemic control among Hispanic patients with type 2 diabetes.7
These practices are not exclusive to one specialty. The applications are endless, and the future of medicine is evolving, one story at a time.
Regardless of one’s feelings about health care infrastructure in the United States, narrative medicine illuminates a profound truth — more can be done to accommodate patients of different backgrounds. Narrative medicine can offer health care providers a new way of thinking, attending, and recognizing. It could bring us closer to the human condition than ever before.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/de-escalation-of-patients/,How to De-Escalate Violent Encounters With Patients,"Every Sunday, Reverend Thomas Hill, training director of the Certified Community Health Specialists (CCHS) Foundation, and his wife Emmeline, a pediatric audiologist, open the doors of the Z Mansion in Tucson, Arizona to serve hundreds of meals to the hungry and unhoused. At “The Z,” Rev Hill welcomes anyone in need, whom he calls “friends and family,” to receive food and medical care.
Kelly Fath, MSN, FNP-BC, FAANP, Commander, United States Public Health Service (USPHS), connected with Hill family in 2017, about 15 years after the meal program at the Z Mansion began. It is not uncommon for 350 people or more people to attend meals on a Sunday. There have not been any violent fights at The Z since the program’s inception, which CDR Fath credits to the Hill’s de-escalation training.
“Everyone [who volunteers] at the Z Mansion is trained in de-escalation. Typically, CCHS trainings were held on the last Sunday of each month, with a practicum during the Sunday First Aid clinics,” she said. “We would teach the volunteers, medical students and nursing students, different concepts of the homeless care, such as recognition of chronic diseases common in the homeless, simple diagnostic screening skills and first aid treatments, and then [the Hill’s] taught de-escalation techniques so that the volunteers could avoid getting hurt. For example, if somebody is coming at you, you step to the side instead of coming at their front; you always stand to the side. Avoid them. If they grab your arm, you just turn your body a little bit. Avoid them. As taught in the course, avoidance and apologizing are the best protection mechanisms. And the best diversion is chocolate milk or Gatorade. You can simply de-escalate the situation by asking them if they would like some chocolate milk and guiding them away from the situation as you are talking to them.”
Though the CCHS workshop offered at American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) National Conference, CDR Fath (and the Hill’s) hope to expand opportunities for clinicians, especially for nurse practitioners (NPs) and other providers whom are often on the front lines of interacting with patients in the emergency department (ED), by offering the de-escalation training in addition to the annual workshop.
To continue to spread the program of de-escalation, CDR Fath recently presented evidence-based de-escalation strategies that NPs can implement when working with underserved and vulnerable patient populations during the American Association of Nurse Practitioners National conference. CDR Fath was joined during the presentation by Jessica Vandenberg, NP, Lieutenant Commander USPHS, and Joel Dulaigh, MSN, ACNP-BC, FAANP, Captain (ret), USPHS, previously the Chief of Staff to the Surgeon General.1
CDR Fath explained that both psychological distress and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are common among unhoused patients, and violent encounters are frequent in this population. Among men residing in an urban homeless shelter, 66% sustained a TBI from assault.2 In a survey of 291 women who were homeless or had unstable housing, 60% indicated that they experienced violence in the 6 months before completing the survey.3 This included emotional, physical, and sexual violence.
Experiencing trauma while navigating homelessness leads to distress and anxiety, which can increase the odds of a patient becoming violent in a medical setting, CDR Fath stated. In one study, a larger proportion of homeless respondents reported lifetime anxiety compared with non-homeless respondents.4
Stereotypes about unhoused or unstably housed patients complicate caring for this population, explained CAPT (ret) Dulaigh. The “difficult patient” label and preconceived biases can prevent proper assessment of a patient’s situation and needs.
“It could be head trauma, it could be an electrolyte imbalance, it could be some other medical thing that is affecting their cognitive ability,” CAPT (ret) Dulaigh said. “They’re not just a difficult person, and I think that that’s one of the things that this program tries to help us identify that you may not be able to if you have the preconceived notions of who this person is.”
LCDR Vandenberg outlined 4 steps to avoid verbal conflicts that escalate to violence, especially in the ED: apologize, approve, applaud, and appease.
Approaching a patient with humility and empathy is the first step toward de-escalation. Patients may present already in an agitated or disgruntled state based on how they were treated by security guards or how long they had to wait to be seen.
Clinicians should avoid using judgmental tones and ineffective commands; telling a patient to “calm down” often has the opposite effect. A better thing to say to a patient, CDR Fath explained, is to be humble, stand to the side and ask them “May I please talk to you. I’m just here to apologize.”
When feasible and safe to do so, sitting down so that the patient and provider are at the same eye level can create a more calming atmosphere for the patient. However, clinicians should not sit down if it will prohibit them from being able to exit the exam room if the patient becomes violent. In those cases, LCDR Vandenberg tells the patient “Come sit down with me? We can talk about this.’ Then I let them vent and I say, ‘I’m sorry. I’m sorry you’ve been through so much.’”
All the clinicians agreed that having an exit route is important when seeing any patient, not just unhoused or unstably housed patients. “If I don’t know that person, I need to be closer to the door than they are because I’ve been blocked in before,” LCDR Vandenberg said. “Try to know your surroundings; make sure your desk is closer to that door.”
Approval in the context of validation is all about validating a patient’s actions to improve their self-esteem.  Validating the patient’s complaint lets the patient know that they are being heard, said Ms. Vandenberg
When talking to a patient, approval may sound like “Thank you so much for NOT going after [that person in the waiting room]. You are such a good guy and have such amazing patience and I thank you so much for NOT reacting to his insults. You are truly amazing,” CDR Fath explained.
Similarly to approval, the applaud step is closely tied to addressing a patient’s feelings of inadequacy or self-blame.
When talking to a patient, approval may sound like “Do you mind if I tell others what a GREAT JOB you’ve done? Other guys would have reacted very, very differently to what just happened. You are so amazing for how you handled that.”
At the Z Mansion, clinicians sometimes use certain food or drink items, such as chocolate milk, to maintain patient satisfaction. Providing crackers or something to drink can go a long way to de-escalating a situation.
While it may not be possible to provide a patient with their preferred food or drink in a hospital setting, appeasement in the context of de-escalation is still possible. In situations where the NP or PA can’t help the patient and the patient becomes more agitated and aggressive, LCDR Vandenberg uses this appeasement tactic. “Let me get you some water and we are going to figure this out.’ Once you are out of the room, you can go get additional help.”
In the ED, clinicians can allow patients to get fresh air as an appeasement strategy. These de-escalation techniques “are universal to any setting,” said CAPT (ret) Dulaigh
CDR Fath noted that clinicians who complete training from the CCHS Foundation likely have better training in de-escalation than the hospital or clinic security staff. In the United States, 21 states do not regulate training for unarmed security guards; 14 states do not regulate training for armed security guards.5
“The first line of defense [in a hospital or clinic] is the security guard if you have one,” said LCDR Vandenberg. Interacting with a security guard, especially one who is not trained in de-escalation, can put patients on edge, she explained.
“Maybe they were triggered before they came in by something that happened,” she said. “But if they’re not, coming into a situation where they see a security guard or see somebody that they feel is putting [up] another barrier, when they hit that barrier throughout their everyday life it can be just that one straw that sets somebody off, whether they’re homeless or not.”
In honor cultures, “whether social interaction is cooperative or competitive depends on whether people’s reputations are threatened.”6 Any perceived insult can be met with violence in an honor culture; this is because aggression is seen as the best way to protect one’s reputation. If a patient who is unhoused or unstably housed perceives a comment as a threat, they may respond as a member of an honor culture. However, an “angry” response does not always look as expected.
While a flushed face and high heart rate are commonly associated with anger, a low resting heart rate is more strongly linked to antisocial behavior compared with a high resting heart rate. CDR Fath explained that when working with patients in an honor culture, it is important for clinicians to consider the importance of avoiding a physical argument rather than the importance of “winning” a verbal argument.",Michelle Falci; Nikki Kean
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/breast-cancer-statistics/,10 Critical Breast Cancer Statistics,"Last Reviewed/Updated: October 15, 2024Breast cancer is the second most common cancer affecting American women but is much less common in American men, according to statistics from the American Cancer Society (ACS).1,2 Although breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women, breast cancer deaths have been steadily declining since 1989.1 Read on for statistics on breast cancer incidence and death across subgroups.
The ACS estimates that, in 2024, there will be 310,720 new cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed in women and 2790 new cases in men.1,2 An estimated 56,500 new cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) will be diagnosed this year as well.1
These numbers are higher than estimates from 2023, which were 297,790 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 55,720 new cases of DCIS among women.3
According to US Cancer Statistics data, the incidence of breast cancer decreased by 2.1% per year during 1999-2004 but increased by 0.3% per year during 2004-2018.4
The most recent data suggest that 1 in 8 women (13%) will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their life.1 For men, the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is 1 in 726 (0.14%).2
According to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, during 2017-2021, the annual rates of new breast cancer cases per 100,000 women were:
According to SEER data, during 2017-2021, the median patient age at breast cancer diagnosis was 63 years.5
In the same time period, the percentages of new cases of breast cancer according to age group were:
SEER data from 2017-2021 suggest that hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer is the most common subtype in the US.6 The percentages of cases by subtype were:
SEER data from 2014-2020 suggest the 5-year relative survival rate for breast cancer is 91.2%.5 Data from women diagnosed with breast cancer during 2013-2019 suggest the 5-year relative survival rates are:
These data demonstrate a significant improvement from relative survival rates reported decades earlier.8 For example, for patients diagnosed during 1975-1977, the relative 5-year survival rate was 74.8%. However, 5-year survival rates seem to have plateaued. For patients diagnosed during 2003-2009, the relative 5-year survival rate was 90.3%.
Breast cancer-related deaths decreased by 44% between 1989 and 2022.9 This was a reversal from the prior trend, when the rate of death increased by 0.4% per year from 1975 to 1989.10
The decline in breast cancer deaths does appear to be slowing, however.9 The annual decrease was 1.9% during 1998-2010 but 1.2% during 2013-2022.
The ACS estimates that 42,250 women and 530 men will die from breast cancer in 2024.1,2
Although non-Hispanic White women are the group most likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, non-Hispanic Black women are the group most likely to die of the disease, according to SEER data.5
During 2018-2022, there were 19.3 breast cancer deaths per 100,000 women per year. Yearly death rates by race/ethnicity were:
In 2018, 63% of patients with stage I or II breast cancer underwent breast-conserving surgery, with or without adjuvant radiation, and 33% underwent mastectomy, according to SEER data.10
More than 4 million breast cancer survivors are currently living in the United States, according to the ACS.1 This number accounts for both patients in remission and those who are still undergoing treatment.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/pediatric-nurse-practitioner-salary-survey-2024/,Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Sees Promise and Failures in 2024 Salary Survey,"The Clinical Advisor 2024 Salary Survey indicates that nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician associates (PAs) really like their jobs. A combined total of 60.7% of NP respondents noted that they were either satisfied or very satisfied with their jobs. That is up from the 2023 Survey that noted 40.9% were either satisfied of very satisfied.
The increase in satisfaction may be because of the waning effects of the COVID-19 pandemic when health care workers worked on the frontlines. Today, NPs and PAs have the ability to prioritize locations and specialties that interest them rather than the needs of their local hospital, community, or state.
Average NP salaries are up in 2024 to $132,707 from $124,131 in 2023. More than a third of NPs (41.9%) said they were satisfied or very satisfied with their salaries compared with 40.9% in 2023. Rising salaries and increased job satisfaction may account for the ranking of the NP profession as the top medical profession by US News and World Report. Despite the increasing salaries, disparities remain.
Despite the increasing salaries, disparities remain. The gender gap is still a vexing issue. Female NP compensation for 2024 was $131,429 while their male colleagues earned $146,064, a difference of $14,635. The 2023 results noted female NPs earned $122,418 while male NPs compensation was $136,786, a difference of $14,308. These figures clearly indicate that no progress is being made on reducing the gender salary gap.
Internal medicine/family medicine/primary care remain the top areas of practice for NPs, with an annual salary of $123,149. However, other specialties are attracting more NPs including psychiatry. PAs are also practicing primarily in internal medicine/family medicine/primary care, and they account for 9.8% of those practicing. Many PAs choose to practice in specialties that reflect their close association with physicians, but none practice in psychiatry. Psychiatry is the second highest area of practice for NPs at 8.1% and also has the highest compensation at an average of $151,714. Pediatrics is the smallest specialty in the NP profession at 4.8% and pediatric NPs (PNPs) receive the lowest compensation of all the disciplines at $117,229.
This finding is not a surprise for a few reasons. There are practicing NPs who discourage nurses who want to care for children from entering PNP programs because “it can limit job prospects.” Then there are PNPs who note “If you only want to take care of children then become a PNP.” Still, other NPs will say they chose a family NP (FNP) program because it is the only program within a reasonable commuting distance.
One response to this could be advising the candidate that there are a number of excellent online and hybrid PNP programs. More PNPs are needed to offer children comprehensive care based on their specialized knowledge of children. Traditionally, pediatrics is the lowest compensation of all medical specialties, which would affect the compensation offered to PNPs in a practice. Pediatrics has notoriously been a low compensation specialty because there are not a lot of Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) codes that pediatricians can bill for that would increase their compensation.
Work related stress and burnout are improving over time for both NPs and PAs. In the 2024 survey, 71.0% of NPs reported moderate-to-high stress, with 13.4% reporting extremely high stress. This compares with 72.6% reporting moderate-to-high stress in 2023, with 11.9% reporting extremely high; and 77.0% in 2022, with 15.1% reporting extremely high stress. Results for PAs were comparable, with 48.8% reporting moderate-to-high stress in 2024.
Burnout, however, seems to be related to compensation in 2024 with 56.7% of NPs making an average salary of $131,116 reporting burnout. Lower compensation is less a factor among PAs; 52.9% of those making an average salary of $138,393 experienced burnout. In 2023, 56.1% of NPs reported burnout compared with 66.2% in 2022. In 2023, 54.0% of PAs reported burnout compared with 62.6% in 2022. The pandemic certainly increased the rate of burnout, which was most likely not just related to salaries. As the stress of the pandemic wanes, salary may become a more important factor in burnout.
Few NPs are planning to leave the profession because of job related dissatisfaction. Only 13.8% of NPs who stated they wanted to leave to leave the profession were earning $127,608. PAs who are on the lower end of compensation scale ($135,741) also seemed to be looking to leave their profession and accounted for 12% of those answering Yes to that question. Adequate salary compensation may make a difference in whether NPs choose to stay in the profession or leave and may also affect PAs in the same manner.
Geographic distribution of NPs reflects the current census numbers, noting a shift of population to the South, with 39% of NPs practicing there. The Midwest has attracted the second highest number of practicing NPs at 22.1%. Interestingly some of the most restrictive states for NP practice are in the South, where NPs continue to serve patients’ needs and practice in this area while advocating for full practice authority (FPA). While the Northeast and West have the highest compensation at $138,810 and $156,983, respectively, these areas are home to fewer NPs.
More NPs practice in suburban areas than in other areas at 40.1%. The same holds true for PAs making their highest area of practice in the suburbs at 47.5%. These data reflect the trend away from practice in the urban areas toward suburban locals that began in 2022. According to the 2022 Salary Survey, PAs have been predominantly working in suburban areas since 2022.
The 2024 survey highlighted some positive trends and a disappointing one. Salaries are continuing to rise. Stress and burnout are down but disparities note that male NPs continue to earn more than female NPs. And the highlight is that NPs and PAs really like their work and plan to continue to practice.","Mary Koslap-Petraco, DNP, PPCNP-BC, CPNP, FAANP"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-adult-and-pediatric-populations/,Patent Ductus Arteriosus: Clinical Features in Pediatric and Adult Populations,"Although the majority of congenital heart diseases (CHD) are diagnosed during childhood, defects can remain undiagnosed until symptoms present in adulthood or abnormalities are found incidentally on imaging.
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the most common cardiac condition in infants born before term, with the incidence of PDA inversely related to gestational age.1 Although PDAs may become evident shortly after birth in newborns with hemodynamically significant defects, prompting earlier diagnosis, it is important to consider PDA as a diagnosis in older populations as well. Evidence suggests that PDA comprises anywhere from 5% to 10% of all CHD.1  Thus, it is crucial for clinicians to recognize PDA in older children and adults in the primary care setting.
Patent ductus arteriosus is a congenital heart defect in which the ductus arteriosus (DA) does not close properly after birth. The DA, a fetal vessel that connects the pulmonary artery to the descending portion of the aorta, forms at around 8 weeks gestation.1 This structure shunts blood away from the fetal pulmonary system and towards the placenta, ensuring sufficient oxygenation of fetal blood.1
After birth, the DA is no longer needed because the infant’s lungs are able to oxygenate the blood. Under normal physiologic circumstances, the DA usually closes functionally within 4 days after birth.1 If it fails to close, it is termed a patent ductus arteriosus (Figure). The origin of most complications of a PDA is the creation of a left to right shunt in the heart.1 The potential complications of a PDA in a preterm infant include intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and an increased need for respiratory support.1
A number of mechanisms assist in the closure of the ductus arteriosus after birth. The DA has what is described as intrinsic tone.2 The dilating factors required to keep it open throughout fetal development decrease after birth through the rise in oxygen pressure as the infant takes a breath, leading to the constriction of smooth muscle within the DA and facilitating closure.1-3 Beyond this functional mechanism leading to closure of the DA, an anatomical mechanism of closure occurs through apoptosis of the smooth muscle,3 which results in the development of a structure known as the ligamentum arteriosum.2
Although PDA is a common cardiovascular condition among preterm neonates, there is no clear consensus on whether to treat it and by what modality. Pharmacologic, surgical, and conservative management approaches are available. Conservative management consists of “watching and waiting” for spontaneous closure without the use of pharmacologic or surgical therapies.2 The 3 most common medications used for the pharmacologic treatment of PDA are indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen. These prostaglandin inhibitors work to constrict the smooth muscle of the DA, facilitating ductal closure.3 Other, less conservative, treatment options include surgical ligation and transcatheter closure. ​​Generally, pharmacologic therapy is considered first in preterm infants, saving surgical repair for those who do not respond to medications.4 However, term infants and older patients may not respond to pharmacological treatment. Thus, if intervention is needed, these populations may benefit from surgical ligation or a transcatheter approach for definitive closure.1
A classic sign of PDA on auscultation is a continuous, “machinery” murmur that is best heard at the left upper sternal border. A PDA may be suspected in a neonate or infant with hypoperfusion demonstrated by oximetry. Patients with PDA also may be tachypneic or have difficulty weaning off respiratory assistance. Another physical examination finding is a widened pulse pressure, such that systolic blood pressure is maintained at a normal range but diastolic pressure is decreased.5 A moderate to large PDA can cause left ventricular dysfunction or left atrial/ventricular enlargement. Additionally, renal and hepatic sequalae are possible.1,3,5
Preterm infants, older children, and adults with PDA all may present with the classic features described above. However, patients may remain asymptomatic until they reach adulthood when hypertension develops. Systemic hypertension creates pressure that increases the left-to-right shunting from the PDA. As a result, symptoms may manifest for the first time in adulthood.6
Another potential presentation of unrepaired PDA is Eisenmenger syndrome (ES), though rare in children,7 which results in severe pulmonary hypertension.8 As described earlier, a hemodynamically significant PDA usually causes a left-to-right shunt.1  However, in ES, the shunt reverses to a right-to-left shunt.8 This reversal is due to pulmonary resistance surpassing systemic resistance.1 This syndrome can be life threatening because unoxygenated blood is distributed systemically.6
Overlap exists between the symptoms of hemodynamically significant PDA and ES. However, a clinical finding that is considered pathognomonic for ES in a patient with PDA is clubbing of the toes with sparing of the fingers.1 A retrospective study conducted in China demonstrated that the risk of ES sharply increased after the age of 15 in patients with PDA that had not been repaired.7 This highlights that older children and adults may present with symptoms of ES before being diagnosed with CHD. Due to the significance of this syndrome, it would be best to prevent it by early detection and intervention for PDA and other CHD.
Patent ductus arteriosus may be detected early in an infant’s life. However, as described earlier, it is possible for patients to not experience any symptoms or exhibit any signs until later in life. Adults with associated pulmonary hypertension can present with a diastolic decrescendo murmur or even more severe signs and symptoms of ES.1 It is important that PDA remains on the differential in adults and children alike. Although it may not be the most likely diagnosis, it cannot be ruled out in older children and adults based solely on age. This is especially true in the primary care setting when clinicians are differentiating potentially innocent murmurs from pathological murmurs. Primary care practitioners should recognize these findings and refer patients to cardiology when appropriate. To do this, each provider must diligently consider all differentials, including PDA, during patient workup.
The continuous “machinery” murmur is the hallmark sound auscultated on patients with PDA. Shared clinical features in both pediatric and adult populations include widened pulse pressure and dyspnea. Older children and adults may present with physical exam features of ES due to longstanding shunting of blood in the heart and pulmonary hypertension. Treatment options include pharmacological therapy with prostaglandin inhibitors or surgical repair via ligation or transcatheter closure. Although congenital heart defects, such as PDA, often are diagnosed in infancy and childhood, it is necessary to also consider these defects in the older patients.","Natalie Hicks, PA-C; Kathy H.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/hyperpigmented-patches-on-face-and-neck/,Dermatologic Look-Alikes: Hyperpigmented Patches on Face and Neck,"A 42-year-old Hispanic man presents to the clinic with discoloration on his neck that has been evident for the past year. The patient reports that the discoloration appears to be darkening and is asymptomatic. He works outdoors and is exposed to significant sunlight. He does not use sunscreen or wear hats. The patient has not tried any treatments for the discoloration. Physical examination reveals pinkish-tan patches on both sides of his neck, with the area below his chin notably spared. He is otherwise healthy and has no other skin discoloration on his body.
Poikiloderma of Civatte is a chronic, benign dermatologic disorder that arises from the cumulative effects of UV radiation and visible light exposure on the skin.1 The term “poikiloderma” refers to the presence of telangiectasias, epidermal atrophy, and pigmentation changes, which together give the disorder its characteristic appearance.1,2 First described by French dermatologist Achille Civatte in 1923, poikiloderma of Civatte is widely recognized as photoaging— a long-term consequence of chronic sun exposure.1,3 As its name suggests, the hallmark features of this disorder include telangiectasias and epidermal atrophy, often accompanied by actinic dyspigmentation.1
Commonly referred to as “Irish neck” or “red neck,” poikiloderma of Civatte typically affects middle-aged individuals with fair skin, particularly those in their 40s, 50s, and 60s.3,4 The disorder is more frequently observed in women than men, with a notable prevalence among menopausal women.3,4 Nevertheless, men are not uncommon sufferers, and women of any menstrual status can present with this condition.3,4
Poikiloderma of Civatte manifests as reticulated red or red-brown hyperpigmented patches interspersed with telangiectasias.1 Of note, these lesions spare the perifollicular skin.1 The disorder usually appears on the lateral neck, peripheral face (particularly the parotid and preauricular areas), and the upper chest, with a characteristic sparing of anatomically shaded regions such as the submental region and anterior neck.1,4 These lesions are almost always symmetrical, affecting both sides of the body.4 Although traditionally considered asymptomatic, recent studies suggest that patients may experience symptoms such as pruritus, burning, or flushing.2,4 Poikiloderma of Civatte is marked histologically by telangiectasias, epidermal atrophy, melanophages, and dermal solar elastosis.1,4
The exact pathophysiology of poikiloderma of Civatte is not fully understood, although it is well established that cumulative sun exposure plays a central role in its development.1-4 Other contributing factors may include hormonal influences, as indicated by the age and sex distribution of affected individuals.3,4 Hormonal influences, particularly the decline in estrogen during menopause, may contribute to the development of this disorder.4 Estrogen loss correlates with reduced skin collagen in dermal connective tissue, which may explain the increased prevalence in postmenopausal women.4 There is also speculation about the role of cosmetics, particularly the use of perfumes or products containing photodynamic substances, which could trigger photoallergic or phototoxic reactions.2-4 A genetic predisposition also may be considered, given the occurrence of the disorder in patients without significant environmental exposures and its presence in some families.2-4
The differential diagnosis for poikiloderma of Civatte includes several disorders with similar clinical presentations, such as melasma, Riehl melanosis, erythromelanosis follicularis faciei, and medication-induced pigmentation.1-5 Unlike poikiloderma of Civatte, melasma lacks the associated atrophy or telangiectasias.5 Melasma also does not always prefer the lateral neck while sparing the perifollicular areas and submental region.5 Riehl melanosis, also known as pigmented contact dermatitis, is similar to poikiloderma of Civatte given its spotty brown pigmentation.5 However, Rhiel melanosis involves minimal to no telangiectasias and is most intense on the forehead and temples.5 This disorder is often caused by topical sensitizers and improves with discontinuation of the offending agent.5 Erythromelanosis follicularis faciei, which features hypopigmented follicular papules on a red-brown patch, can mimic poikiloderma of Civatte, as the latter spares the perifollicular skin creating the illusion of “hypopigmented” follicular papules.1 However, the absence of follicular hyperkeratosis in poikiloderma of Civatte distinguishes the 2 disorders.1 Other differential diagnoses include chronic graft-vs-host disease, berloque dermatitis, and friction melanosis.3,4 Although poikiloderma of Civatte is typically diagnosed clinically, dermoscopy and histologic examination can aid in distinguishing it from other disorders.6
Patients often seek treatment for cosmetic reasons, and several treatment options exist for poikiloderma of Civatte.2,7 Because it is associated with photoaging, sun protection is a fundamental component of management and should include broad-spectrum SPF and protective clothing. Laser therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment. The pulsed dye laser (PDL) at a wavelength of 585 nm, intense pulsed light (IPL), and the potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) 532-nm laser have demonstrated efficacy in improving both the telangiectasias and hyperpigmentation characteristic of this disorder.1,2,7,8 IPL, which emits a broad spectrum of light ranging from visible to near-infrared (500-1200 nm), is particularly effective.1,2
The KTP laser uses a 532-nm wavelength produced by passing 1064 nm of light from a Q-switched (QS) Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) laser through a KTP crystal. This treatment has also shown positive results in studies.8 Caution is advised when using the PDL, as cases of depigmentation have been reported.9 Other treatment modalities include cryotherapy, depigmenting agents, topical retinoids, chemical peels, electrosurgery, topical flavonoids, and newer technologies such as fractionated ablative and non-ablative lasers.1,3,10
A 63-year-old White man with a history of acne seeks a consultation about discoloration on his neck that has been present for decades. The discoloration has remained consistent over time, neither lightening nor darkening. The patient has worked outdoors on a farm for many years, experiencing significant sun exposure. He never used sunscreen or wore hats and continues not to do so. He has not tried any treatments for the discoloration. He reports that the discoloration appeared while he was taking oral medication for acne, which he used for many years. Physical examination reveals brownish-black patches on both sides of his neck, although the area below his chin is less affected.
Minocycline-induced pigmentation is a well-recognized adverse effect of prolonged minocycline therapy.1,5 Minocycline is a systemic, phototoxic antimicrobial agent that can lead to a type of non-immunologically mediated drug-induced cutaneous hyperpigmentation or discoloration first described in the 1970s.1,5,11
As a second-generation tetracycline, minocycline is commonly used to treat various disorders, such as acne vulgaris, rosacea, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma.11–14 Pigmentation tends to occur with prolonged minocycline use at doses exceeding 100 mg daily.5,13 Although the exact risk factors for developing minocycline-induced pigmentation are not fully understood, studies suggest that characteristics such as age, genetic predispositions, or concomitant dermatologic diagnoses may play a role in increasing the likelihood of developing this disorder.13-15
Minocycline pigmentation has a high incidence rate in patients with comorbidities such as pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, atopic dermatitis, acne vulgaris, and rheumatoid arthritis.16,17 Advanced age also may play a role in developing minocycline pigmentation, given the increased likelihood of pigment deposition in skin with actinic damage or degenerative skin changes.13,14 Some studies point to evidence of minocycline pigmentation occurring in 2 sisters as a basis for suspicion of a genetic predisposition for the disorder.14
There are several mechanisms by which drugs can cause hyperpigmentation: enhancing melanin production, depositing the drug itself or its metabolites within the dermis, and inducing post-inflammatory changes.1,5 The underlying mechanism of minocycline-induced pigmentation depends on the specific type of pigmentation present.1,5
Minocycline-induced pigmentation is classified into 3 types: type I, type II, and type III, each with distinct histologic and clinical features.1,5 Type I pigmentation involves iron- or calcium-containing melanin-like substance pigment granules within the dermis.1 Type II pigmentation is characterized by iron- or melanin-containing pigment granules in the dermis.1 The iron-containing pigment granules, observed in both type I and type II, can be intracellular or extracellular and may consist of hemosiderin and/or a minocycline derivative complexed with chelated iron.1 However, type III pigmentation involves increased melanin within the basal epidermis and/or dermal melanophages.1
These 3 types of minocycline-induced pigmentation appear distinct from one another. Type I presents as blue-black discoloration at sites of inflammation and scars, such as acne lesions.1 Type II is characterized by blue-gray macules or patches ranging in size from 1 mm to 10 cm, typically appearing on previously normal skin, most commonly on the shins or forearms.1 Type III manifests as a diffuse “muddy brown” pigmentation especially in areas with significant sun exposure.1 The blue-black discoloration associated with minocycline pigmentation also can affect the teeth, nails, sclera, oral mucosa, bones, thyroid, trachea, tympanic membrane, and cartilage.1,5
The differential diagnosis for minocycline pigmentation includes various other slate gray-blue pigmenting disorders, such as argyria, erythema dyschromicum perstans, hemochromatosis, and Riehl melanosis.5,12,13 A key distinguishing factor for argyria is a history of silver exposure as opposed to minocycline use.5 Erythema dyschromicum perstans, commonly referred to as ashy dermatitis, presents with well-demarcated lesions on photoprotected sites, distinguishing it from minocycline pigmentation.5 Hemochromatosis-related pigmentation is typically more generalized but exacerbated in sun-exposed areas, and Riehl melanosis is characterized by brown-gray versus slate gray-blue discoloration.5 Other differential diagnoses include melasma, poikiloderma of Civatte, Addison disease, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and end-stage metastatic melanoma.5,13 Minocycline-induced pigmentation is typically diagnosed clinically based on its appearance and temporal association with the offending medication.5 However, a biopsy revealing the specific histologic characteristics can be helpful in less clear cases.5
Treatment for minocycline-induced pigmentation begins with the cessation of the implicated drug.1,5 After discontinuing the medication, pigmentation may gradually fade over several months to years, although in some cases it may persist indefinitely.1,5 Because of the phototoxic nature of the condition, sun protection is essential and should consist of sun avoidance along with broad-spectrum SPF and protective clothing.5
In more refractory cases and patients with cosmetic concerns, laser therapy is the treatment of choice.1 Three types of lasers have been used in treating minocycline-induced pigmentation: the QS alexandrite, QS Nd:YAG, and QS ruby lasers.1,5,13,18 Among these, the QS alexandrite has demonstrated superior results compared with the QS Nd:YAG 1064-nm laser and QS ruby 694-nm laser, which were either less effective or caused more discomfort, respectively.13,18
In addition, the picosecond alexandrite (755-nm) laser has proven effective in multiple patients and offers the advantage of fewer treatment sessions and minimal to no patient discomfort.15 Cases have reported the resolution of minocycline-induced pigmentation during oral isotretinoin therapy prescribed for acne, and successful use of fractional non-ablative skin lasers in treating the disorder.19,20 Although these are not widely accepted therapies, their positive outcomes suggest potential future treatment options for minocycline-induced pigmentation.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/dnp-defamation-case-against-physician/,Court Allows DNP’s Defamation Case Against Physician to Proceed,"This case shows a lack of basic respect that health care practitioners should have for each other. Although the doctor in this case just wanted to brush his comment off, the court ultimately agreed with the nurse practitioner’s (NP) claim for defamation.
Ms A worked as the Director of Inpatient Nursing in a large hospital. In addition to her work at the hospital, Ms A, who has a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree, also worked as a clinical professor in the nursing program of a nearby community college.
Ms A was standing by the nurses’ station wearing a hospital uniform that had “Dr A” sewn on it. She was approached by Dr S, a physician, who had practicing privileges at the same facility. According to the legal record, Drs A and S had this exchange:
“Who is ‘Dr A’?” Dr S asked.
“I’m Dr A,” she replied.
“Who did you sleep with to get that title?” asked the doctor, loudly enough for coworkers to hear.
“Excuse me? What did you just say?” Ms A asked.
“Who did you sleep with to get that title?” repeated the Dr S.
She left the nurses’ station but reports feeling flustered, angry, and embarrassed by the remark. Ms A reports she no longer enjoyed her work, and now felt that her co-workers were judging or talking about her. Her confidence was affected. She began seeing a therapist and took time off from work.
Ms A sought the counsel of an attorney who suggested that she sue the physician for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Ms A alleged that she incurred damages in the form of medical/psychological expenses, lost future wages, and that she suffered emotional distress due to anxiety, reduced pleasure in her work, and being held up for ridicule.
Dr S hired a defense attorney and filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that Ms A’s complaint failed to state valid claims for either defamation or intentional infliction of emotional distress.
Slander is the verbal form of the tort of defamation. To prove it under Mississippi law (where this case took place), the following elements must be shown: 1) a false and defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff; 2) an unprivileged publication to a third party; 3) fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher; and 4) actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm or the existence of special harm caused by the publication. (Note that ‘publication’ in this context means speaking the statement.)
Dr S maintained that the plaintiff had failed to meet the first and fourth required elements. Specifically, regarding the first element, he alleged that the claim should be dismissed because his words were not defamatory. His attorney argued that the law states that “defamation must be clear and unmistakable from the words themselves and not the product of innuendo, speculation, or conjecture,” and that if the hearer must “struggle to see how and whether they defame, by definition the words are not defamatory in law.” He claimed that asking “Who did you sleep with to get that title?” was not actionable defamation because it cannot be attributed as defamatory meaning absent ‘speculation and conjecture.’
The court disagreed and noted that Ms A’s complaint asserted that the doctor’s statement conveyed that she was unskilled and obtained the Doctorate not by hard work and training but by providing sexual favors to others. The court agreed that the physician’s words were direct and suggested that Ms A had slept her way into obtaining her Doctor title, and thus the plaintiff could satisfy the first element.
The fourth element of defamation, special harm, requires the plaintiff to prove that either they experienced economic loss or that the defendant’s actions were slander per se. Courts have recognized that words are slanderous per se when they “impute a want of integrity or capacity, whether mental or pecuniary, in the conduct of a profession, trade, or business.”
Dr S’s attorney argued that his client’s statement was just a ‘caustic comment’ that does not fall into slander per se. Again, the Court disagreed, noting that it had taken place at work, near a nursing station, where other staff were present, and that “a reasonable jury could conclude that asking someone who they slept with to obtain the title delineated on their scrubs means that person obtained the title by conducting themselves dishonorably in their profession.”
The Court concluded that the defamation claim had survived the motion to dismiss and could proceed. However, it dismissed the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, noting that such a claim is difficult to prove, and requires conduct “so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.”
It is appalling that one health care practitioner should treat another with such a blatant lack of respect for no reason. This is never called for.
Unfortunately, however, there have been issues with physicians taking offense at DNPs referring to themselves as “Doctor” – such as the California case where a DNP was fined for referring to herself by the title. Regardless, unprofessional innuendo should never be used, nor tolerated, in the professional workplace. We will continue to follow this case.","Ann W. Latner, JD"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/prescription-digital-therapeutics/,Prescription Digital Therapeutics for Mental Health: A New Era in Psychiatry,"The recent proliferation of prescription digital therapeutics for mental health disorders represents a transformative shift in psychiatric care. Although these products aim to leverage technology to increase patient accessibility to evidence-based treatment, many experts have raised concerns over patient information protections, the gamification of psychiatry, and the logistics of this new form of therapy.
Herein, we provide an overview of prescription digital therapeutics currently cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and highlight clinician perspectives on navigating this evolving intersection of technology and mental health care.
On September 4, 2024, the FDA cleared DaylightRx for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) among patients aged 22 years and older.1
The app-based digital therapeutic is a 90-day treatment that provides users with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) via interactive lessons on cognitive restructuring, applied relaxation, and stimulus control.
On April 1, 2024, the FDA approved Rejoyn — a prescription smartphone app-based digital therapeutic — as an adjunct to clinician-managed outpatient care for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) among adults aged 22 years or older.2 Rejoyn is the first digital therapeutic authorized by the FDA to treat MDD.
The Rejoyn program includes a combination of the Emotional Faces Memory Task (EFMT) exercises and brief cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based lessons, along with text messaging to reinforce content and encourage engagement.3
“As a clinician, I’m excited that this app is now a treatment option for my patients due to its affordability and accessibility, with no contraindications or side effects observed in the clinical trial,” said psychotherapist Saundra Jain, MA, PsyD, LPC, adjunct clinical affiliate for the School of Nursing at the University of Texas at Austin.
“The cognitive emotional training exercises are designed to simultaneously activate the amygdala and prefrontal cortex,” Dr Jain explained.3 “This can help strengthen the connection between these 2 areas, thus improving how the brain processes thoughts and emotions, which may lead to a reduction in depression symptoms.”
On April 23, 2024, the FDA approved MamaLift Plus as the first prescription digital therapeutic for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate postpartum depression (PPD) among patients aged 22 years and older.4
MamaLift Plus is a neurobehavioral intervention that uses elements of CBT, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), behavioral activation therapy (BAT), and interpersonal therapy (IPT). The therapeutic is intended as an adjunct to clinician-managed outpatient care.
In January 2024, Click Therapeutics, Inc received FDA breakthrough device designation for CT-155, their investigational prescription digital therapeutic. CT-155 uses psychosocial intervention techniques to treat negative symptoms among adults with schizophrenia.5
NightWare – a prescription digital therapeutic designed to reduce sleep disturbance among adults aged 22 years and older with nightmare disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – received FDA authorization in November 2020.6 NightWare analyzes changes in heart rate and body movement during sleep (using a smartwatch and sensors) and delivers gentle vibratory stimulation to abort nightmares.
EndeavorRx is a video-game-based intervention intended to improve attention among children aged 8 to 17 years with primarily inattentive or combined-type attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as part of a therapeutic treatment plan.7 Endeavor Rx received FDA approval in June 2020.
The reSET and reSET-O are indicated for the treatment of substance use disorder and opioid use disorder and received FDA clearance in 2017 and 2018, respectively.8,9
The company that originally developed the apps, Pear Therapeutics, filed for bankruptcy and ceased business operations in 2023, casting uncertainty on the future of these digital therapeutics. However, PursueCare acquired reSET and reSET-O and resumed service in August 2024.10
Although the FDA approved these prescription digital therapeutics, patient privacy issues and the protection of sensitive information are ongoing concerns in the digital health care space. “Protecting patient information is critical with apps like these, and it is up to companies that make these medical devices to implement robust safeguards to ensure that sensitive patient information is secure,” Dr Jain emphasized.
With Rejoyn, for example, the “consents are written in plain language and allow users to opt-in for things like sharing their data with Rejoyn nurses for treatment support,” and patients can change their privacy choices in the app at any time, she continued.11
Generally, however, patients who use digital therapeutics “are putting their data in the hands of these companies, and some have a good track record of privacy while others don’t,” according to John Torous, MD, MBI, director of the digital psychiatry division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in Boston.
While the apps are required to adhere to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) rules and other privacy regulations, the Federal Trade Commission recently “settled with 2 digital mental health companies for privacy violations, highlighting that the privacy status of the entire space remains less than ideal,” he said.12
The widespread adoption of prescription digital therapeutics is substantially limited by disparities in reliable access to broadband and high-quality digital devices among patients13 and variable insurance coverage. However, some applications can be offered at a discounted rate for patients paying out-of-pocket.14 “Coverage from healthcare insurers is imperative for wider use and the success of these treatments,” Dr Jain said.
Another major barrier to this new frontier in mental health care is the lack of physician awareness and education about integrating digital options into clinical practice, she added.
“Every FDA-approved app I have seen needs to be used under the direction of a physician, and many psychiatrists are unsure whether to prescribe these, as they are unsure if the apps actually work well enough to make a difference for the patients they treat,” Dr Torous explained. “Most clinicians are interested to learn more but so far have been underwhelmed by the evidence regarding these digital therapeutics.”
He noted that digital therapeutics are FDA-authorized as medical devices, and the evidence required by the FDA for authorization of these devices is often less rigorous than the evidence required for medication approval.“Finally, with thousands of non-prescription apps accessible today and many of them with perhaps stronger evidence than FDA-cleared ones, there is currently little need for clinicians to prescribe these,” Dr Torous said.
However, Dr Jain believes that clinicians will ultimately embrace the integration of digital therapeutics into practice, given their favorable safety profile and potential for symptom reduction in some patients. “Digital therapeutics are enhancing mental health care by providing accessible new treatment options that complement, rather than compete with, traditional therapies,” she stated.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/fruits-vegetables-food-insecurity/,Prescribing Is Not Always Enough: PAs Grow Fresh Fruits and Vegetables to Combat Food Insecurity,"As PA Week comes to a close, The Clinical Advisor interviewed a pair of PAs from Sioux City,Nebraska who aim to combat food insecurity by growing fresh fruits and vegetables for their patients. Jill Bundy, PA‑C, MPAS, is a PA at the Siouxland Community Health Center, and David Faldmo, PA‑C, MPAS, is the quality director and PA at the Siouxland Community Health Center.
PA Faldmo: We live in a society where our lifestyle can lead to metabolic unfitness. [In our practice] we see patients with diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and fatty liver disease, among other diseases. Addressing that, detecting symptoms early, and getting people on a better lifestyle path is key to avoiding a lot of these conditions.
PA Bundy: Playing into that is the education for our patients about how metabolic unfitness is a problem. I think there’s a lot that patients don’t quite recognize as health risks that set them up for these disorders.
PA Faldmo and PA Bundy: We were intimately involved in the development of a social determinant of health screening tool created by the National Association of Community Health Centre. We were 1 of the 4 teams that developed that screening tool that’s widely used now.
We screened our patients for food insecurity and found a need. If there are insecurities noted, the care team is called in to see what we can do to help address some of the determinants identified. However, food insecurity is a frequent one that we identify in the patient population that we serve.
That’s the primary reason why we began growing produce. We educate our patients and tell them it would help their medical condition to stick to a healthy diet, which is higher in fruits and vegetables. But if they don’t have access to fresh produce, that’s very difficult to accomplish. Being able to create a way to meet that need is kind of how we ended up here.
To help meet the need for healthy foods, we partnered with Voices for Food. We had a social determinant of health committee and we were trying to partner with community agencies to help address some of these insecurities. We thought Voices for Food would be a great organization to proactively be involved with in helping patients live a healthier lifestyle through the foods they eat.
PA Faldmo and PA Bundy: There are so many medical disorders that are linked to our metabolic capital and fitness. Alzheimer disease and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are among the many diseases that are related to our diet and lifestyle. Overweight and obesity also lead to orthopedic issues such as knee pain, hip pain, back pain, etc. There’s so much that we deal with day after day that’s related to being overweight or obese.
On the social side, there is a psychologic element. It’s rare for us to see food insecurity in isolation, frequently it is coupled with transportation or housing security, which can create significant stress for patients and their families.
We try to address all of those needs and to be able to help a family provide food for themselves and their children to take that stress off of them, which can help impact their mental health. We have had some patients come in who are understandably prioritizing feeding their children instead of feeding themselves or taking their medications. Being able to offer a person who has not eaten in days a meal before they leave has been a huge help for that population.
We are trying to make it more sustainable. We have a relatively short growing season here in Nebraska, therefore we partner with local food banks and try to connect patients with the local mission and shelters as a way to re-enter housing, etc.
PA Bundy and Faldmo: One of the big issues is that though food is abundant, the affordable food for the majority of our patients is ultra-processed foods that contribute to health issues. Providing fresh vegetables and educating patients on the importance of a healthy diet can resolve metabolic disorders. Trying to get away from the highly processed starchy foods that unfortunately are more common and can impact cholesterol, diabetes, blood pressure, etc. Most clients are more comfortable with a low-carb diet that avoids processed foods vs a low-fat approach, which has not been successful in our patients. We advise patients to use whole foods and fresh vegetables and to stay away from anything that comes out of a box whenever possible.
We also have a weight management program that we invite patients to participate in.  This is a weekly or monthly class that they can attend indefinitely and this allows them to make healthy food choices. [The classes provide] more in-depth education on living a healthy lifestyle. We also have a diabetes prevention program that is available to anyone who may be at risk for the disease. We try to intervene before they get diabetes through the CDC’s National Diabetes Prevention Program.
PA Bundy and Faldmo: We’re 6 months into our first cohort of patients enrolled in the weight management program. We thought it’d be good for us to have a supportive program where they are educated on lifestyle changes and all the nuances of what can happen due to their metabolic unfitness or being overweight or obese. Although we do have the availability of weight loss medicines, we pair that with more education and lifestyle changes.
PA Faldmo: We shouldn’t sell our patients short, they’re able to make changes, but we also have to prescribe medicine to help them overcome their health issues. There are patients out there, not everyone, who are willing to make changes and to better themselves by changing their lifestyles. It’s an important lesson to learn that we should give patients the chance to make lifestyle changes and not just prescribe medicines. Lifestyle changes can allow them to overcome the presenting complaint.
PA Bundy: Seeing the patient as a whole person. If they present with diabetes, what led to that, is there a food insecurity problem, is there a lot of stress at home or at work that leads to stress eating? Making sure that mental health needs are addressed. If that’s a concern, make sure that they have a safe place to live and that there are no other barriers to their medical care, and make sure that the patients are aware that this is a safe place where they can bring their medical concerns.
Sometimes, the medical issue may not be the biggest thing that needs to be addressed that day, it could be an unsafe living environment or helping them understand that this is a safe place to be.",Jeanelle Jacobs
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/fqhc-medical-director/,PA Becomes Medical Director of FQHC,"On October 15, 2024, Israel Mendez, MS, PA-C, will become the first physician associate (PA) to become a medical director at Charlotte Community Health Clinic (CCHC), a large Federally-Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. For PA Mendez, a first-generation college graduate, this is a dream job that has taken him full circle.
PA Mendez was raised by a single mother, Petrona Mendez, in Morganton, NC. As the oldest, he helped raise his 5 siblings — attending parent conferences, cooking, and cleaning. The family had limited resources and relied on food stamps, Medicaid, public housing, and free school lunches.
In high school, PA Mendez became a certified nursing assistant. He received his undergraduate degree in public health from East Carolina University (ECU), where he met his mentor, Joseph Lee, PhD, MPH. Dr Lee taught a class called Health Disparities, which focused on the unequal distribution of health, disease, suffering, and death by social status (eg, race/ethnicity, sex/gender, socioeconomic status, geographical region, etc.). “I just really loved the content so I asked him if he needed any help,” he told The Clinical Advisor. As it turned out, Dr Lee was looking for a research assistant, together they published 2 papers.
As an undergraduate, PA Mendez served as president of the Pre-PA club. “I knew I wanted to become a PA since the 11th Grade. While I had interactions with several MDs and DOs, it was the PAs who always stood out to me. I chose ECU because of their PA program.”
Dr Lee helped PA Mendez perfect his CV and resume, and even prepped him for his PA school interview. “He was so intentional about getting [other professors] to interview me and of course serving as a reference and providing letters of recommendation.”
PA Mendez graduated from the PA program at ECU in December 2020 and began working at MedNorth Health Center, a FQHC in Wilmington, NC, where he provided prenatal, pediatric, and adult care. He also provided hepatitis C treatment, medications for opioid use disorder, Nexplanon and IUD insertion, and care to the formerly incarcerated through the FIT program. “My number one interest has always been public health. It is the lens I have used to approach medicine — and how I see the community and the individual patients.”
PA Mendez is passionate about FQHCs. They play a vital role in communities by providing accessible, high-quality health care to underserved populations. They serve as a safety net for individuals who might otherwise lack access to medical services, including low-income families, uninsured or underinsured individuals, and those living in rural or medically underserved areas. “Focusing on holistic, patient-centered care, FQHCs address both medical and social determinants of health, contributing to better overall community health outcomes.” PA Mendez said.
Growing up in a single-parent home with a working mother, PA Mendez knows first-hand that having extended weekday and weekend hours, is key in providing access to care. In addition, being culturally sensitive is another key component of care. “When we are dealing with patients and cultures that we don’t understand, cultural competency becomes essential. How do we recruit the best staff that understands and presents compassionate care to people who don’t look like them, don’t speak like them, or people who don’t think like them?” he said.
Moving to Charlotte to start his new position, PA Mendez feels that he has come full circle. As a new father, he is excited to begin his new job. “I am extremely grateful to CEO Carolyn Allison, CMO, Dr Sveta Mohanan, and HR Manager Aaron Sammons for believing in me. As a PA I am well-equipped to serve as a medical director due to my training, clinical experience, and adaptability across various health care settings. Trained in the medical model, much like physicians, I have the skills to make sound clinical decisions, manage patient care, and lead healthcare teams effectively” he said.
“My collaborative approach to health care, combined with the ability to work autonomously, allows me to bridge gaps between different health care providers and ensure cohesive, patient-centered care. Additionally, my strong focus on communication and patient education are critical skills for directing medical staff and implementing quality improvement initiatives. I am so excited about this new opportunity and eager to help improve the lives of the people of Mecklenburg County and the surrounding areas through Charlotte Community Health Clinic.
As a full-time undergraduate, PA Mendez worked as a CNA and relied on scholarships and student loans to pay for school. As the first to attend university, “I had no one to guide me — no financial or academic advice from those who had been there before. While I was incredibly grateful for the support of my academic advisors, I still longed for my family’s help. But how could they offer it when they were just trying to survive back home.”
“A core memory is everyone receiving a care package from home but me. My mother can’t read or write in any language, so I never faulted her. But I was still sad and at times [I had] imposter syndrome,” he said.
When asked what he would tell his younger self, PA Mendez said, “I would just remind myself that comparison is the thief of joy. There will always be people around you with more experience, but they’re simply at a different stage of life. If you constantly ask, ‘Why am I not there yet?’ you’ll miss the beauty of where you are now. Every moment offers a lesson if you’re willing to embrace it. I’d also remind my younger self to keep loving others with the same grace and compassion as Christ.”",Nikki Kean
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/genetics-to-treat-lysosomal-storage-diseases/,PA Relies on Genetics to Treat Lysosomal Storage Diseases,"In honor of PA Week 2024, we highlight Laura Buch, MSPAS, PA-C who is just 1 of 9 PAs nationwide that specialize in lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). Buch completed the Greenwood Genetics Center’s (GGC’s) Metabolic Advanced Practice Provider fellowship in 2021 and works with the genetics team to treat patients with infantile-onset metabolism errors.
PA Buch: After graduating from the University of North Carolina in 2013, I began working for a company that soon went under and I was laid off soon after graduation. This led me to work as a medical scribe at a family practice office that included 2 PAs and a physician where I was able to truly see the tremendous work that PAs do. I loved seeing the long-term relationship established between the PAs and the physician and the level of care given to each patient.
After graduating from PA school, I stumbled across the Greenwood Genetic Center through an email inviting individuals to come to the Greenwood Genetic Center for a 2-year Metabolic Advanced Practice Provider Fellowship. After the interview, I accepted the fellowship and fell in love with the workplace culture and genetics.
PA Buch: In my opinion, [it is a lack of] focus on rare diseases and [once suspected] getting patients to a place where we can access genetic testing and provide counseling on this topic. This is dependent on education. More and more health care programs are starting to shed light on genetics education, and this is important as the “eyes do not see what the brain does not know”. In general medicine, we are trained with the adage “When you hear hoofbeats, think horses not zebras” as in, “Common things are common”. However, in genetics, you have to think about the zebras.
PA Buch: LSDs are multisystemic diseases that have a broad range of presentation. We see inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and these present in different ways. However, IEMs and some LDSs can be detected on newborn screening [with the measurement of lysosomal enzymatic activities in dried blood spots]. We get a chance to intercept these patients in the newborn period. These are cases where the patient appears normal at birth and has no other signs or symptoms that you wouldn’t expect to see in an otherwise happy healthy baby. Therefore, newborn screening is important for us to detect these underlying biochemical abnormalities, low enzyme levels, and other abnormalities to be able to intercept those patients, make a diagnosis, and intervene with treatment as soon as possible.
For example, we have an LSD on South Carolina’s newborn screening right now called Pompe disease which is caused by the lack of enzymes that lead to glycogen accumulation in the lysosomes of our muscle cells, and that accumulation over time leads to weakness. Not only does that affect skeletal muscle, but in these patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease, the cardiac muscle is impacted and these individuals can also have difficulty breathing and obtaining motor milestones. For individuals without treatment, infantile rare diseases can have life threatening effects within the first year or so of life, emphasizing the need for newborn screening and early detection/intervention.
PA Buch: Even with different disorders on newborn screening happening in different states, we are detecting cases early on that we would not have been able to without newborn screening. Every baby bornshould receive newborn screening between the first 24 to 48 hours of life. Rates of detection have improved over time with our improved newborn screening parameters, understanding of diseases, and technology.
In South Carolina, we screen for a few LSDs and [are] working to include more in the upcoming year. Advocacy groups and patient-led organizations also work toward adding other IEMs and LSDs to the newborn screening panel.
PA Buch: Speaking for those in South Carolina, Dylan’s law was passed in 2019 after a family had a child who was born with Krabbe disease. This disease is rapidly progressive and, without intervention, patients have rapid neurologic deterioration and can die fairly young. This family saw the effects and deterioration in their child, which led to his untimely death, causing them to push for Krabbe disease, and also other LSDs including Pompe disease, as well as Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS 1) to be included in newborn screening in South Carolina. We started screening for Pompe disease and MPS 1 in February 2021, and started screening for Krabbe disease in May 2023. This led to many other infants being screened and properly diagnosed with these disorders and receiving appropriate and timely treatment.
We have an active patient population here in South Carolina of individuals with Fabry disease, advocating with the Fabry disease community, that has been raising money, hosting annual fundraising, and engaging in education and advocacy for adding Fabry disease to the newborn screening and they were successful. We’re now enacting Fabry disease screening in the next couple of months. This goes to show [that] families have the power and can enact change in their state based on their personal experiences.
PA Buch: The LSD patient population is near and dear to my heart. Their families are so strong and it’s always amazing to see how they are doing after treatment.It’s also incredible to see what treatment can do. Enzyme replacement therapy is used for treating several LSDs and is life-saving. Having an efficacious treatment available enables children to be detected and treated early. It’s great to see new therapies approved, clinical trials in development, and have the opportunity to be personally involved here at the genetics center.
For example, infantile-onset Pompe disease treatment [needs to be] quickly started. Without treatment, children are at risk for cardiomyopathy, significant muscle weakness, and respiratory failure. MPS I and Krabbe disease may require hematopoietic stem cell transplantation right away. We know what to look for when conducting newborn screening and set a range of wheels in motion with other providers. We’re coordinating with nurses, pediatricians, hospitalists, and specialists to get these important treatments on board for these children. We have been able to [start] enzyme replacement therapy, within 14 days of life, initiating weekly treatments and refer to transplant centers for appropriate intervention.
PA Buch: The power of hope. Being able to give a diagnosis, put a name to a disease, and provide families with answers, is one piece of the puzzle and that’s the first step. In biochemical genetics, the ability to be able to offer many types of interventions, something that will help: a diet modification that can save a baby’s life; an interventional treatment such as enzyme replacement therapy, or an oral drug that will help this child grow and develop as normally as one can be expected, makes what we do so meaningful.
Although we don’t have an intervention for everyone, there are clinical trials and more research going on and we’re getting new diagnoses every day. We’re learning more about the natural history of these diseases and what we could potentially do. One day, we may be able to repurpose other drugs, to use AI to find new answers; for these families to have the resources in the field of genetics we can propel these patients forward. The hope is amazing.
Another important lesson I want to share is that genetics is out there. The field is growing and we want more providers. We have the ability to detect new and different conditions and expand newborn screening programs across the country. For providers who are not in the field, I encourage you to learn about the genetics resources in your state or local area and connect with them.  If a child has health concerns in multiple body systems, a referral to genetics could save their life. We can help you with testing and interpret the results. We can help guide treatment for your patients. As clinicians, we do not know what we can do for individuals until [they] have a diagnosis. And for those still searching [for a diagnosis], consider [contacting] your local genetics provider because we’re here to navigate those waters alongside you.",Jeanelle Jacobs
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/beta-blockers-after-myocardial-infarction-and-preserved-ejection-fraction/,Rethinking Beta-Blocker Use Following Acute Myocardial Infarction,"Beta-blockers have long been included in the treatment regimen following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for many patients, based primarily on dated research.1 The results of a recent clinical trial highlight the need for more careful consideration of this approach in certain cases.2
“Despite the lack of clear evidence of benefit in the contemporary setting, current guidelines widely recommend beta-blocker use after myocardial infarction,” wrote study authors Yndigegn et al. They noted the need for new data regarding the necessity of beta-blocker use in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).2
In the parallel-group, open-label Randomized Evaluation of Decreased Usage of Beta-Blockers after Acute Myocardial Infarction (REDUCE-AMI) trial, published in April 2024 in the New England Journal of Medicine, the investigators examined outcomes associated with beta-blocker use in 5020 patients with AMI who received early coronary angiography and had a LVEF of at least 50%. Participants were randomly assigned to long-term beta-blocker treatment (n=2508) or no beta-blocker treatment (n=2512).2
Over a median follow-up of 3.5 years, the primary end point (composite of death from any cause or new MI) occurred in 7.9% of patients in the beta-blocker group and 8.3% of those in the no-beta-blocker group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.79-1.16; P =.64).
The 2 groups also showed similar cumulative incidence rates of secondary end points, including death from any cause (3.9% vs 4.1%), death from cardiovascular causes (1.5% vs 1.3%), MI (4.5% vs 4.7%), hospitalization for atrial fibrillation (1.1% vs 1.4%), and hospitalization for heart failure (0.8% vs 0.9%).
In addition, the 2 groups showed comparable rates of safety end points, including hospitalization for bradycardia, second-or third-degree atrioventricular block, hypotension, syncope, or implantation of a pacemaker (3.4% vs 3.2%), as well as hospitalization for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.6% in each group) and hospitalization for stroke (1.4% vs 1.8%).
“The absence of an effect of beta-blocker treatment on the cumulative incidence of death or myocardial infarction appeared to be consistent across all prespecified subgroups,” such as patients categorized by demographic factors, previous cardiovascular events, and comorbidities, Yndigegn et al reported.
The role of beta-blockers after AMI is currently being investigated in several ongoing trials.1
To explore the implications of these findings on clinical practice, Cardiology Advisor interviewed the following experts:
Dr Granger: The most recent guidelines are from the European Society of Cardiology in 2023, which recommend routine beta-blockers for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with LVEF of 40% or less (Class I, level of evidence A) and to consider routine beta-blockers for all ACS patients regardless of LVEF (Class IIa, level of evidence B).3
Dr Fonarow: Most of the randomized clinical trials supporting beneficial effects of beta-blockers in patients with AMI were conducted the era before routine use of reperfusion and revascularization therapy, antiplatelet drugs, statins, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors.
As these therapies have been proven to reduce the cardiovascular mortality of patients with AMI, whether beta-blockers continue to provide benefit has been in question. More recent trials establish a clear benefit of beta-blockers after AMI in patients with LVEF of 40% or below with or without heart failure symptoms.
Yet for patients with preserved LVEF, the benefits of beta-blockers have been questioned. Guidelines had recommended use of oral beta-blockers in the first 3 years after myocardial infarction and then being considered optional. Beta-blockers are generally safe and well tolerated. However, as patients need to receive a number of other medications after AMI, it would be helpful if beta-blockers can be omitted for certain carefully selected patients.
Dr Long: The current guidelines for the use of beta-blockers following AMI are, quite frankly, decades old. Based primarily on the BHAT trial published in 1982, they were aimed at reducing oxygen demand by the heart as a result of their effects on heart rate and blood pressure as well as their suppression of ventricular ectopy, which is felt to be driven by catecholamines during the post-MI period. This was most prominent in the first year following MI with a diminished effectiveness after 1 year of survival.4
Moreover, because they predated our current approaches to AMI, their use has not kept up to date with current practice. However, they clearly do have a role for patients with LVEF of 40% or less in this scenario, as an extension of their effectiveness in patients with systolic heart failure of any cause.
So, the pros of prescribing beta-blockers post-AMI are generally felt to include mortality reduction, particularly in patients with reduced LVEF, prevention of arrhythmias by stabilizing the electrical activity of the heart, reduction in the risk of subsequent MI, and symptom relief.
The cons of prescribing beta-blockers post-AMI include side effects such as fatigue, depression, and sexual dysfunction, which can affect patient compliance; contraindications such as asthma, severe bradycardia, or hypotension; heart failure exacerbation in patients with decompensated heart failure; and the risk of hypoglycemia.
As such, when deciding whether to prescribe beta-blockers post-AMI, the following factors should be considered:
Dr Granger: Based on the REDUCE-AMI trial results, I would recommend that routine beta-blockers for patients like those included in that trial (revascularized 1- or 2-vessel disease and LVEF ≥50%) is no longer necessary.
Dr Fonarow: For patients with myocardial infarction with LVEF of 50%, or higher beta-blockers are being reconsidered. While the REDUCE-AMI trial did not demonstrate benefit, there are additional trials underway and guideline recommendations have not yet been revised. For patients without other indications for beta-blockers, who are optimally treated with other post-MI guideline-directed medical therapies and have LVEF of 50% or higher, the evidence is in evolution and shared decision-making discussion should take place.
It is critical that patients with LVEF of 40% or less be treated with beta-blocker therapy in the absence of contraindications. These patients are at higher risk for sudden death, progressive heart failure, and recurrent cardiovascular events. Beta-blockers provide a large benefit to these specific patients, and therapy should be started and continued indefinitely in these cases.
Dr Long: Shared decision-making is an essential approach in patient-centered care, particularly when discussing the use of beta-blockers after AMI. Some recommendations for clinicians include:
Dr Granger: These results add important new information to guide practice, and my practice has changed so that, for this population with AMI and revascularization and preserved LVEF and no other reason to use a beta-blocker (like hypertension or arrhythmias), I no longer prescribe beta-blockers. For patients with reduced LVEF and more complicated disease, beta-blockers are still indicated.
Dr Fonarow: The REDUCE-AMI trial may be practice-changing. However, as this was an unblinded trial and relatively underpowered, additional clinical trial evidence would be helpful. A number of other randomized prospective trials are underway. For patients with myocardial infarction with LVEF of 50% or higher, routine use of beta-blockers should be reconsidered, pending additional evidence.
Dr Long: The findings from the REDUCE-AMI trial provide important insights into the management of patients with AMI who have preserved LVEF of 50% or higher. The results underscore the importance of a more tailored approach to post-AMI management and may prompt a re-evaluation of existing guidelines, which generally recommend beta-blocker use broadly post-AMI.
For patients with preserved LVEF, the lack of observed benefit in reducing death or new MI needs to be weighed against the potential side effects and quality of life implications of beta-blocker therapy. Avoiding unnecessary beta-blocker prescriptions in this subgroup could reduce medication burden, side effects, and health care costs while focusing on more beneficial treatments.
In conclusion, the REDUCE-AMI trial’s findings advocate for a more refined and individualized approach to beta-blocker use post-AMI, potentially leading to changes in clinical practice and guideline recommendations to optimize patient outcomes based on their specific clinical profiles.
Dr Granger: The REDUCE-AMI trial is a great example of trials to inform “de-prescribing.” We need more such contemporary trials and a greater focus on using the medications proven to improve clinical outcomes. Education of doctors and patients, as well as strategies to improve implementation of these evolving guidelines, remain high-priority needs.
Dr Fonarow: There remain significant opportunities to improve the care and outcomes for patients after AMI.5,6 Some patients are not receiving high-intensity statin therapy or, when indicated, combination lipid-lowering therapy. There are many patients with post-MI left ventricular dysfunction where mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are Class I recommended but not applied. There are patients who are candidates for RAAS inhibitors who are not treated. There are patients who would benefit from cardiac rehabilitation that are not referred. It is critically important to use and optimize adherence to these evidence-based, guideline-directed therapies to reduce the risk of recurrent events.
Dr Long: Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of beta-blocker therapy in patients with preserved LVEF post-AMI, including effects on quality of life, heart failure development, and other cardiovascular events.
Subgroup analysis is needed to identify which subgroups of patients with preserved LVEF might still benefit from beta-blocker therapy based on other risk factors or comorbidities. Studies are also needed to understand the mechanisms behind the lack of benefit in patients with preserved LVEF, which could inform the development of targeted therapies.
In addition, head-to-head comparisons of beta-blockers with other standard therapies are needed to better understand their relative benefits and risks in different patient populations.
Finally, professional societies should update guidelines to reflect the REDUCE-AMI findings, providing clear recommendations for beta-blocker use in patients with preserved LVEF.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/pa-moms-support-for-working-women/,"PA Moms Provides Support, Friendship, Scholarships for Working Women","Hilary Clinton wrote a book titled “It Takes a Village”…. for working mothers, especially in the physician associate (PA) field, this is especially true. PA Moms was started in 2016 as a Facebook group by Raquelle Akavan, DMSc, PA-C, out of a need to connect with other working mothers.
PA Akavan was working full-time at a Level 1 Trauma Center in the Bronx. She was working long hours and could go days without seeing her daughter, who was almost 2 years old. “That was really heartbreaking and I needed a community of other people who were going through the same thing as I was.”
From the Facebook Group grew PA Moms, which now has over 18,000 members. PA Moms is run by PA Akavan, an assistant professor in the Doctor of Medical Science (DMSc) program at the University of Lynchburg, and a group of diverse PAs of all different backgrounds. According to their website: “PA Moms empowers Physician Associates (PAs) to be of service to one another and their patients to their fullest potential. Our mission is to provide each other with support, friendship, and camaraderie in order to decrease career burnout and work-related stressors.”
When the COVID-19 pandemic started in early 2020, PA Moms was there to provide a safe space for PAs to discuss issues of burnout, personal struggles, fears, etc, PA Akavan told The Clinical Advisor. There has always been burnout in the medical profession, but the pandemic increased the need for community, PA Akavan said. According to The Clinical Advisor 2024 Salary Survey, 52.9% of PAs reported feelings of burnout in 2024, which is down from a high of 62.6% in 2022.
In addition to discussions of childcare and burnout, PA Moms is a support group for women going through personal struggles, including difficult medical issues, cancers, sick children, and even stroke.
PA Akavan experienced firsthand the power of community when she suffered a stroke following a car accident in November 2020, she was 33 years old. “This was the hardest time of my life, and my work and the group got me through it. There was a member who dropped everything, showed her surgeon my imaging, and then helped me through my treatments. That is also my motivation to help others. When I see people getting helped by PA Moms, it keeps me going.”
In addition to lending support, PA Moms has fundraised for multiple efforts including the American Heart Association, cancer research and Women’s health equity. The group also provides scholarships for PA students in partnership with the PA Foundation. “We have given out 7 scholarships to date and hope to give more every year,” PA Akavan said.
PA Moms has partnered with PAs for Women Empowerment to find preceptors for PA students. “Mentorship also goes on within the group in a more informal way,” said PA Akavan. “People connect through posts, Facebook Messenger, phone calls…people become best friends in our group. I have multiple mentors through the group.” One example of how the group supports each other is when a mother lost their child’s special stuffed animal. “The group mobilized and one member found the exact stuffed animal, bought it, and shipped it to the PA mom.”
During hurricane Helene, PA Moms mobilized and searched for missing members. Members also donated goods and supplies. “They went out of their way to bring supplies to those in need,” said PA Akavan.
PA Moms also supports family members in need across the country. “When a member’s mother was undergoing treatment in a hospital in a different state, they reached out, and women volunteered to visit her in the hospital.”
During the early days of the pandemic, PAs and nurse practitioners played a key role in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19. Many states waived or suspended PA supervision requirements. In New York, during the pandemic, “PAs didn’t need a supervising or collaborating physician but now they do. Maybe that’s part of the problem” of clinician shortages following the pandemic, she said. Patients are experiencing longer wait times for appointments and becoming increasingly frustrated. However, “there is a solution,” noted PA Akavan.
[Editor’s Note: The American Academy of Physician Associates (AAPA) has worked with state legislatures to pass the PA Licensure Compact, which has been adopted by 13 states: Colorado, Delaware, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.]
The PA profession was first established in 1967. “It may have made sense back then to have supervision by physicians, but now PAs have proven that we can take care of patients safely,” PA Akavan said. “It doesn’t matter where in the country you studied, if you were educated as a PA, you were educated exactly the same way.”
According to PA Akavan, “there are unnecessary administrative burdens for hospitals and clinics when it comes to hiring PAs, which in turn decreases access to health care for our patients. Sometimes these barriers prevent PAs from being hired and this also contributes to burnout and stress for her members.”
In March 2025, PA Moms will host the second annual Women’s Medical Summit. The first summit was held in February 2024 and included CME courses, workshops, and a PA Moms Prom. This year’s keynote speaker will be Betsy Grunch, MD (@ladyspinedoc), who advocates for PAs/NPs and women empowerment, PA Akavan said.
The summit is a great opportunity for the women (PAs and NPs) to connect face-to-face. “Some of the women I met for the first time in person last year, and it was amazing,” PA Akavan said.",Nikki Kean
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/nps-pas-salaries-burnout/,"NPs and PAs Salaries and Burnout: A Step in the Right Direction, But More Action Is Needed","Burnout can mean different things to different people. However, the common understanding is that it involves mental exhaustion, depersonalization, and a decreased sense of personal accomplishment. Although salary plays a part in overall job satisfaction, I do not believe this is the driving factor for most nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician associates (PAs).
I became a PA after years of working as a community health educator and hearing the stories of people who were dissatisfied with their current health care options. I wanted to do more to fill this gap. My classmates in PA school had similar desires of how they wanted to do more to make a positive difference for people and their health. Salary is important and necessary, and many NPs and PAs reported a salary increase over the past year. Yet, there seems to be a disconnect between higher salaries and feelings of burnout.
As seen in the 2024 results of The Clinical Advisor Salary Survey, NPs and PAs are reporting less burnout than they did previously, which is a sign of progress. Although this is an encouraging trend, more than 50% of advanced practice providers (APPs) reported some signs of burnout. Interestingly, more than half of APPs report being “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their job. And close to 80% of APPs say that they do not plan to leave their jobs despite any dissatisfaction.
So, what accounts for this paradox of high reports of burnout and low reports of job dissatisfaction? I think it goes back to the “Why did I become a PA?” question. APPs have an overwhelming sense of duty and commitment to their patients. We know that we are doing important work, and we do not want to abandon that.
By its very nature, being a medical provider is challenging, even in the best of circumstances. This is why employers must create a healthy environment for their workers. Along with salary raises, employers need to work to reduce stress for workers.  Improving communication between leaders and employers can give APPs a sense of control and ownership over their clinical work. This can help lessen mental exhaustion and improve feelings of accomplishment.
The 2024 Salary Report shows that APPs are committed to staying at their jobs, but this commitment should not come with the heavy burden of burnout. This year was the inaugural Health Workforce Well-Being Day on March 18. Hopefully, events like this will bring about more attention and stress the importance of taking care of those who care for others.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/gut-microbe-imbalances-could-predict-risk-for-autism-adhd-and-speech-disorders-in-children/,"Gut Microbe Imbalances Could Predict Risk for Autism, ADHD, and Speech Disorders in Children","The Conversation — Early screening for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism is important to ensure children have the support they need to gain the essential skills for daily life. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for developmental delays, with additional screening for those who are preterm or have a low birth weight.
However, the US Preventive Services Task Force has called for more research into the effectiveness of current autism screening practices. Primarily based on milestone checklists and symptoms, autism diagnoses also currently rely on observations of behavior that often manifests after crucial developmental stages have passed.
Researchers and clinicians are working to develop simple, reliable tools that could identify early signs or risk factors of a condition before symptoms are obvious. While early screening can lead to the risk of overdiagnosis, understanding a child’s developmental needs can help guide families toward resources that address those needs sooner.
We are researchers who study the role the microbiome plays in a variety of conditions, such as mental illness, autoimmunity, obesity, preterm birth and others. In our recently published research on Swedish children, we found that microbes and the metabolites they produce in the guts of infants – both found in stool and cord blood – could help screen for a child’s risk of neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism. And these differences can be detected as early as birth or within the first year of life. These markers were evident, on average, over a decade before the children were diagnosed.
Biomarkers are biological indicators – such as genes, proteins or metabolites in blood, stool or other types of samples – that signal the presence of a condition at a certain point in time. There are no known biomarkers for autism. Efforts to find biomarkers have been largely hindered by the fact that autism has many potential pathways that lead to it, and researchers tend to ignore how these causes may work together as a whole.
One potential biomarker for neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism are gut microbes. The connection between the gut and brain, or the gut-brain axis, is an area of considerable interest among scientists. Gut microbes play significant roles in health, including in immunity, neurotransmitter balance, digestive health and much more.
A lot of work has been done around mapping what a “typical” microbiome looks like based on age and organ system. Researchers have shown that the microbiome is personalized enough that it can distinguish 2 people or 2 households even better than genetics, with differences in colonization starting very early in life.
The microbiome undergoes immense changes during childhood. It shapes and is shaped by the immune system and influenced by life changes and events. It is also influenced by factors like genetics, environment, lifestyle, infection and medications.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, pain and constipation are common in children with autism and ADHD, with as many as 30% to 70% of autism patients also diagnosed with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Untreated GI issues can also lead to additional sleep and behavioral disorders among these children. A small pilot study found that children with autism showed improvements in gastrointestinal and autism-related symptoms after having healthy microbes transferred into their guts, with some benefits lasting up to 2 years.
Most studies on the microbiome and neurodevelopmental conditions, however, are restricted to people who are already diagnosed with ADHD, autism or other conditions, and these studies often show mixed results. These limitations raise an important question: Does the microbiome play a direct role in the development of autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions, or are changes in microbiome composition a consequence of the conditions themselves?
Some investigations have proposed that the microbiome has little or no association with future autism. However, these studies have a notable limitation: They don’t examine microbial imbalances prior to diagnosis or symptom onset. Instead, these studies focus on children already diagnosed with autism, comparing them to their siblings and unrelated neurotypical children. In most cases, dietary data and samples are collected several years after diagnosis, meaning the study cannot test for whether microbial imbalances cause autism.
We wondered whether studying the bacteria residing in small children before they are diagnosed or show symptoms of autism or other conditions could give us a clue into their neurodevelopment. So, we examined the cord blood and stool collected at approximately 1 year of age from participants of an ongoing study called All Babies in Southeast Sweden, which follows the health of approximately 17,000 children born between 1997 and 1999 and their parents. We have followed these children since birth, nearly 1200 of whom were later diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder by age 23.
We found significant differences in bacterial composition and metabolite levels that developed before symptoms of neurodevelopmental conditions – such as gastrointestinal upset, crankiness and sleep problems – as well as formal medical diagnoses. These differences spanned many conditions, including autism, ADHD and speech disorders.
Next, we linked bacteria to neurotransmitters – chemical signals that help brain cells communicate – and vitamins such as riboflavin and vitamin B in the child’s stool. Given previous research on children and adults already diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder, we expected to find differences in the microbiome composition and health between those with and without neurodevelopmental conditions.
But we were surprised to discover just how early these differences emerge. We saw variability in the microbes and metabolites that affect immune and brain health, among others, in the stool collected from the diapers of children around 1 year of age and in umbilical cord blood collected at birth.
The imbalance in microbial composition – what microbiologists call dysbiosis – we observed suggests that incomplete recovery from repeated antibiotic use may greatly affect children during this vulnerable period. Similarly, we saw that repeated ear infections were linked to a twofold increased likelihood of developing autism.
Children who both repeatedly used antibiotics and had microbial imbalances were significantly more likely to develop autism. More specifically, children with an absence of Coprococcus comes, a bacterium linked to mental health and quality of life, and increased prevalence of Citrobacter, a bacterium known for antimicrobial resistance, along with repeated antibiotic use were 2 to 4 times more likely to develop a neurodevelopmental disorder.
Antibiotics are necessary for treating certain bacterial infections in children, and we emphasize that our findings do not suggest avoiding their use altogether. Parents should use antibiotics if they are prescribed and deemed necessary by their pediatrician. Rather, our study suggests that repeated antibiotic use during early childhood may signal underlying immune dysfunction or disrupted brain development, which can be influenced by the gut microbiome. In any case, it is important to consider whether children could benefit from treatments to restore their gut microbes after taking antibiotics, an area we are actively studying.
Another microbial imbalance in children who later were diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders was a decrease in Akkermansia muciniphila, a bacterium that reinforces the lining of the gut and is linked to neurotransmitters important to neurological health.
Even after we accounted for factors that could influence gut microbe composition, such as how the baby was delivered and breastfeeding, the relationship between imbalanced bacteria and future diagnosis persisted. And these imbalances preceded diagnosis of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability by 13 to 14 years on average, refuting the assumption that gut microbe imbalances arise from diet.
We found that lipids and bile acids were depleted in the cord blood of newborns with future autism. These compounds provide nutrients for beneficial bacteria, help maintain immune balance and influence neurotransmitter systems and signaling pathways in the brain.
Microbiome screening is not a common practice in well-child visits. But our findings suggest that detecting imbalances in beneficial and harmful bacteria, especially during critical periods of early childhood development, can provide essential insights for clinicians and families.
There is a long way to go before such screening becomes a standard part of pediatric care. Researchers still need validated methods to analyze and interpret microbiome data in the clinic. It’s also unclear how bacterial differences change across time in children around the world – not just which bacteria are present or absent, but also how they may be shaping immune responses and metabolism. But our findings reaffirm the growing body of evidence that the early gut microbiome plays a key role in shaping neurodevelopment.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/health-risks-rising-in-mountain-areas-flooded-by-hurricane-helene/,Health Risks Rising in Mountain Areas Flooded by Hurricane Helene,"The Conversation — Hurricane Helene’s flooding has subsided, but health risks are growing in hard-hit regions of the North Carolina mountains, where many people lost access to power and clean water.
More than 160 deaths across the Southeast had been attributed to Hurricane Helene within days of the late September 2024 storm, according to The Associated Press, and hundreds of people remained unaccounted for. In many areas hit by flooding, homes were left isolated by damaged roads and bridges. Phone service was down. And electricity was likely to be out for weeks.
As a disaster epidemiologist and a native North Carolinian, I have been hearing stories from the region that are devastating. Contaminated water is one of the leading health risks, but residents also face harm to mental health, stress that exacerbates chronic diseases, and several other threats.
Access to clean water is one of the most urgent health concerns after a flood. People need water for drinking, preparing food, cleaning, bathing, even flushing toilets. Contact with contaminated water can cause serious illnesses.
Floodwater with sewage or other harmful contaminants in it can lead to infectious diseases, particularly among people who are already ill, immunocompromised, or have open wounds. Even after the water recedes, residents may underestimate the potential for contamination by unseen bacteria such as fecal coliform, heavy metals such as lead, and organic and inorganic contaminants such as pesticides.
In Asheville, the flooding caused so much damage to water treatment facilities and pipes that officials warned the city could be without running water for potentially weeks. Most private wells also require electricity to pump and filter the water, and many people in surrounding areas could be without power for weeks.
State and federal agencies began delivering extra bottled water to the region shortly after the storm, but supplies were limited, and it’s likely that a number of people won’t be able to reach the distribution sites soon. Access to fresh food is another concern for many areas with roads and bridges washed out.
Inside homes, floodwater can create more health risks, particularly if mold grows on wet fabrics and wallboards. Standing water outside also increases the risk of exposure to mosquitoes carrying diseases such as West Nile virus. Mosquitoes are still active in much of the region in the fall.
Many of the images in the news after the hurricane hit showed roads, hospitals, and entire towns inundated by floodwaters. In North Carolina, more than 400 roads were closed, blocking access to the major regional health care hub of Asheville, as well as many smaller communities.
While supplies can be airlifted to clinics, residents needing urgent access to treatments such as dialysis or daily medications for substance use disorders may have been cut off. Health care workers may be unable to access their clinics as well.
Cuts and other injuries are common in the aftermath of storms, as people clean up debris, and even small wounds can become infected. The stress, exertion, and exposure to heat can also exacerbate chronic conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
Beyond the risks to physical health, the fear, stress, and losses can affect mental health.
Research has consistently shown that emergency responders’ mental health can suffer in widespread disasters, particularly when they know disaster victims, deal with severe injuries, or feel helpless. All of those conditions were present as Hurricane Helene’s floodwaters swept away dozens of people, with many more still listed as missing.
Stigma, cost, and a lack of mental health care providers all add to the ongoing challenges to mental health after disasters. Research shows that a large percentage of people face mental health challenges after disasters.
According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2 federal grant programs provide mental health services support to individuals and communities after disasters. However, one of those sources of funding ends after 60 days, the other after one year. Given the decades of recovery facing western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene, I believe these programs are woefully inadequate to meet the mental health needs of the populations affected by the storm.
Western North Carolina is often described as a “climate refuge” because of its cooler summers. And Asheville in particular has become a popular place for retirees and new residents. Recent data shows the city has the second-highest migration rate in the nation.
But Helene and other extreme storms that have flooded the region make its vulnerabilities clear.
In the aftermath of the flooding, newcomers unfamiliar with the risks and longtime residents alike will be dealing with ongoing health concerns as they try to clean up and rebuild from the storm. Even as attention shifts to other disasters, the people in this region will still need help to recover for months and years to come.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/respiratory-failure-in-the-emergency-department/,Management of Respiratory Failure in the Emergency Department,"A 65-year-old White man is brought in by emergency medical services (EMS) for worsening shortness of breath over the previous 2 days, cough producing purulent sputum, and fever of 103°F. On EMS arrival at the residence, the patient’s oxygen saturation readings were 75% on room air. Bilateral breath sounds revealed expiratory wheezing to all lobes anteriorly and posteriorly, with diminished breath sounds to bases posteriorly. Breath sounds were noted to be very “tight.” EMS administered an albuterol sulfate/ipratropium bromide inhalation treatment, began supplemental oxygen at 2 to 4 liters per minute per nasal cannula, and transported the patient to the hospital.
The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, and smoking, and previously underwent appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and repair of a gunshot wound to the chest. Although the patient quit smoking 10 years ago, he had a 30-pack per-year history. On arrival at the emergency department (ED), he is in moderate respiratory distress. Acute bronchospasms persist, and the patient’s oxygen saturation levels fail to improve above 86% on 4 liters of supplemental oxygen or on high-flow oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is initiated using the bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) mode.
Heart tones reveal a regular rhythm, but the patient’s heart rate remains slightly tachycardic at 110 (sinus tachycardia). His blood pressure is 166/108 mmHg and his respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute. He is using his accessory muscles to breathe.
The table shows the results of the laboratory workup. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is indicative of acute respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia. The B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is less than 100, which is considered within normal limits. Rapid influenza diagnostic testing (RIDT) for Influenza types A and B, and rapid testing for COVID-19 were all negative. Clinicians may consider obtaining a respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel.
A chest radiograph reveals diffuse, patchy infiltrates in the right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe. No infiltrates are seen in the left lung, and no pneumothorax or effusions are noted. The heart size is within normal limits.
The patient is diagnosed with combined acute hypoxemic (type I) and acute hypercapnic (type II) respiratory failure along with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
For a diagnosis of pneumonia to be confirmed, patients must have 3 of the following 5 criteria: elevated white blood cell count (WBC), fever, infiltrates on chest radiograph, cough, and mucopurulent sputum production.¹
In cases where there is no suspicion for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas organisms,2  treatment of pneumonia in the inpatient setting includes ceftriaxone and azithromycin administered via intravenous piggyback (IVPB). The general course of treatment is 5 to 7 days, with a transition to oral antibiotics after approximately 3 days if there is clinical improvement. Monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg IV or orally daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg IV or orally daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg orally daily) is an appropriate alternative for patients who cannot receive a beta-lactam plus a macrolide.
Resolution of infiltrates on imaging lags behind clinical improvement. Therefore, the goal is to demonstrate clinical improvement. If pneumonia does not clear fully, patients can develop an empyema, which would require surgical intervention and an extended period of IV antibiotics.
Because the patient was in respiratory failure, NIPPV was employed. Guideline-recommended indications for NIPPV include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.3 The most common mode used in the ED for acute respiratory failure is BiPAP. NIPPV typically is administered with a nasal/oral mask, and a good seal must be maintained during treatment. By employing inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) settings, the BiPAP mode most closely mimics the normal respiratory breathing cycle and is instrumental in decreasing the work of breathing (WOB), improving ventilation (blowing off PaCO2), and improving oxygenation.
Contraindications to NIPPV include a patient’s inability to protect their airway and profuse secretions. Studies have demonstrated NIPPV’s efficacy in lowering PaCO2, increasing PaO2, and decreasing the WOB. NIPPV has been proven to be beneficial because it decreases rates of intubation, hospital lengths of stay, and complications from mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.4
Since MRSA or Pseudomonas are not suspected, and the patient has no known allergies, he is initiated on a beta-lactam and a macrolide. A regimen of ceftriaxone (1 g IVPB daily) and azithromycin (500 mg IVPB daily) is started. Considering the patient’s significant bronchospasms and respiratory failure, methylprednisolone sodium succinate also is started at a dose of 80 mg IVP every 8 hours. NIPPV, with settings of IPAP 12 and EPAP of 6, is continued. Oxygen titration to achieve the lowest fraction of inspired oxygen to keep the oxygen saturation level greater than or equal to 92% is to be maintained. Respiratory therapy orders indicate that the patient should be weaned from NIPPV as tolerated. Cardiac monitoring and continuous pulse oximetry are ordered. Renal and red blood cell indices are indicative of mild volume depletion, so isotonic crystalloids-normal saline is started at 75 mL/h, albuterol sulfate/ipratropium bromide treatments are ordered every 6 hours, and a respiratory polymerase chain reaction panel is collected.
The patient will need to be transitioned from the IV steroid to oral steroids (Prednisone), complete a prednisone taper, and finish the course of oral antibiotics after discharge. He also will need to follow up with his primary care provider 1 to 2 weeks after discharge and obtain a 2-view chest x-ray at 4 to 6 weeks to document the clearing of infiltrates. Since there was a high suspicion of underlying COPD in this patient, an order for full pulmonary function testing will be given to the patient to be completed at an outpatient facility.
Acute respiratory failure is a common occurrence in the ED, and providers must be skilled in providing evidence-based treatments to stabilize patients quickly and efficiently. The patient in this case had a combination of type I and type II respiratory failure, with an underlying etiology of CAP.  Although there was no previous formal diagnosis of COPD before his hospital stay, because of his hypercapnia and long history of cigarette smoking, there was a high suspicion of COPD.
Systemic corticosteroids are not routinely used in the treatment of CAP, but because the patient had significant bronchospasms, corticosteroids were warranted. In addition, providers should not hesitate to use NIPPV in the ED for hypercapnic and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Numerous complications associated with mechanical ventilation can be avoided by the judicious use of NIPPV. If the patient can protect their airway and does not have copious respiratory secretions, they should be given a trial of NIPPV.
Indications for NIPPV include respiratory acidosis (typically with a pH<7.30, respiratory rate >25, PaCO2>45, and increased WOB).5 Studies have found NIPPV to be beneficial in cases of COPD exacerbation and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.6 Patients undergoing NIPPV must be monitored very closely for decompensation, and ABGs should be repeated 1 hour after the treatment is initiated. Realistically, it may require up to 2 hours of treatment before there is near full resolution of acid-base balance and decreased WOB.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/lecanemab-side-effects-cvd/,The Potential Risks of Lecanemab Use in Patients With High Cardiovascular Risk,"The US Food and Drug Administration’s 2023 approval of the anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody lecanemab for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer disease represented a major advance for this population.1 However, special caution is warranted when considering the use of this therapy in individuals with high cardiovascular risk.2
In the phase 3 double-blind CLARITY-AD trial, lecanemab demonstrated a 27% reduction in cognitive decline (based on scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes) at 18 months compared to placebo in patients with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer disease.3,4 Lecanemab also met all key secondary endpoints, including greater reductions in amyloid burden on positron-emission tomography (PET) and more favorable outcomes on scales such as the AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale14 (ADAS-cog14) compared with placebo.3
Among the adverse effects reported in the trial, infusion-related reactions were observed in 26.4% of patients in the lecanemab group compared to 7.4% of those in the placebo group, and the rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions (ARIA-E) was 12.6% with lecanemab and 1.7% with placebo.3
In an opinion paper published in March 2024 in JAMA, Ko et al highlighted the need for caution regarding the use of lecanemab in patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factors. They noted that the risk of macrohemorrhage was 0.7% with lecanemab vs 0.2% with placebo, and this risk was further increased in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.2
Although no deaths related to treatment or ARIA had been reported at the time that the CLARITY-AD results were published, subsequent findings from the open-label extension of the trial revealed 3 treatment-related deaths, each due to cerebral macrohemorrhages. One of these patients had cardiovascular disease and was receiving anticoagulant therapy, and another patient died after receiving tissue plasminogen activator for acute stroke.5
“While reducing harmful amyloid in the brain, these monoclonal antibodies may secondarily contribute to inflammation and weakening of brain blood vessels, increasing the risk of brain swelling and hemorrhage, which can be disabling or even fatal,” explained Mitch S V Elkind, MD, MS, chief clinical science officer and past president of the American Heart Association.6
The older adult patients for whom lecanemab is indicated have an elevated risk for diseases such as atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and pulmonary embolism, said Deepak L Bhatt, MD, MPH, MBA, director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and the Dr Valentin Fuster Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “These conditions are treated with antithrombotic therapy, and for patients already receiving lecanemab, their risk of cerebral bleeding will be increased.”
“Current recommendations are based on limited data, and more research is needed. However, some work groups of experts primarily involved in the care of patients with Alzheimer disease have recommended that patients who require anticoagulants not be prescribed lecanemab due to the increased risk of bleeding,” Dr Elkind said.5
“While there is no firm guidance, it does seem prudent for the time being to avoid lecanemab in patients who need to be on anticoagulant therapy,” Dr Bhatt stated.
In addition to the use of anticoagulants, other risk factors for intracerebral bleeding include apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) gene carrier status, especially APOE4 homozygosity, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation/amyloid beta-related angiitis (CAA-ri/ABRA).5
“Caution should be used when considering lecanemab for patients who have these risk factors,” wrote the authors of Appropriate Use Recommendations (AUR) for lecanemab. They also recommend APOE genotyping of all lecanemab candidates prior to treatment initiation to guide risk discussions with patients and care partners.5
Overall, “Treatment likely needs to be individualized, and CVD specialists should be involved in shared decision-making with patients who may benefit from these drugs to manage their cognitive problems,” Dr Elkind suggested.
There is currently no solid consensus on whether patients already receiving amyloid-lowering therapies such as lecanemab should receive fibrinolytic or anticoagulant medications if needed for new-onset conditions, according to Dr Elkind. “In many cases, decisions about the use of clot-busting drugs need to be made in emergency settings—such as an acute stroke—and thus discussing these issues and setting up a care plan ahead of time in the office, should an emergency arise, may be valuable.”7
The AUR also recommend that clinicians obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on all patients prior to lecanemab initiation. Following treatment initiation, MRIs should be obtained prior to the 5th, 7th, and 14th infusions, and before the 26th infusion in higher-risk patients, to “assess for microhemorrhages and macrohemorrhages, brain swelling, and superficial siderosis,” Dr Elkind advised.5 He noted that the risk of bleeding with lecanemab is highest soon after treatment initiation.
“Imaging evidence of numerous new microhemorrhages or even a single large hemorrhage should lead to cessation of lecanemab therapy,” he said. “Patients should also be monitored for symptoms such as headache, confusion, or focal neurological changes, which could also be a sign of brain hemorrhage.”5
At present, it remains unclear how imaging changes might affect treatment decisions regarding the use of antithrombotic agents in patients receiving lecanemab, Dr Elkind added.
“There is ongoing registry-based research that will provide useful information about how lecanemab performs in patients in the real world, including in patients with known cardiovascular disease,” Dr Bhatt said.8 “Ideally, there would also be more randomized clinical trials investigating the use of lecanemab in patients with significant cardiovascular disease.”
Dr Elkind cited the need for further work to determine the mechanisms by which anti-amyloid therapies can weaken blood vessels and cause edema bleeding in some patients, and to develop antidotes to these side effects.
“From the clinical perspective, more data are needed on the magnitude of risks of ARIA in real-world populations—as opposed to the somewhat rarefied world of clinical trials—as well as the risk factors for bleeding, both genetic and otherwise, and the optimal strategies to mitigate those risks,” he said.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/prescribing-antipsychotics-in-patients-with-dementia/,Prescribing Antipsychotics in Patients With Dementia: What Clinicians Should Know,"Dementia is an umbrella term describing cognitive and memory changes associated with functional impairment that result from various brain pathologies. Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in adults aged 65 years and older, accounts for 60% to 80% of diagnosed cases of dementia in the US.¹ The Alzheimer’s Association estimates that 6.9 million Americans are living with AD.1,2 This is because age is the greatest risk factor for AD, and the number of baby boomers (1946-1964) reaching their 7th, 8th, and 9th decades is increasing every year.3
This projection does not include non-Alzheimer dementias, which make up 20% to 40% of dementia diagnoses.¹ The next most common type of dementia after AD is vascular dementia, followed by frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, and Parkinson disease dementia.1 Mixed dementias also occur, affecting up to 50% of persons with an AD diagnosis, most commonly those aged 85 years and older. ¹
Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are noncognitive symptoms. The most prevalent BPSD include apathy, depression, aggression and agitation, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and irritability. Other symptoms include appetite disturbances, motor disturbances, delusions, and hallucinations (Table 1). BPSD increase in incidence as the disease worsens,4 and experts estimate that 98% of patients with a dementia diagnosis will experience such symptoms at some point during their illness.5
Patients suffering with BPSD are more likely to be hospitalized, be placed in long-term care earlier, experience neglect or abuse, and die.4 Family caregivers dealing with BPSD are more likely to experience financial hardship due to lost job hours or loss of employment, isolation, and neglect of their own physical and mental health.¹
Historically, the use of antipsychotics for the more distressing symptoms of agitation and psychosis has been largely off-label.6 Studies have not been able to show that antipsychotics, both first- and second-generation agents, are safe and effective when used for these symptoms.7 In a network meta-analysis published in 2019, no single best option was found among the most commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, and olanzapine) with respect to the risk for death.8
Aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine were more effective at improving symptoms but less safe. Regarding the risk for cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAE), quetiapine and aripiprazole were more effective and safer, whereas olanzapine was the most effective but the least safe. Risperidone was least effective and least safe.8 The meta-analysis did not look at pimavanserin, which has been evaluated in the management of  psychosis in patients with Parkinson disease.9
Only with the 2023 FDA approval of brexpiprazole has an atypical antipsychotic carried a specific indication for the treatment of agitation in dementia.10 Approval was based on research by Grossberg et al showing improvement in agitation symptoms and a good safety and tolerability profile when the drug was given according to the recommended titration schedule.5 The indication is specific to agitation in Alzheimer dementia, and proper use requires the ability to recognize what does and does not constitute agitation.
According to the Agitation Working Group of the International Psychogeriatric Association, agitation encompasses a variety of symptoms that may be found accompanied by a state of emotional distress.11 Symptoms may include verbal aggression (eg, cursing, yelling, crying) and physical aggression (eg, hitting, kicking), or motor disturbances such as fidgeting, handwringing, or pacing. These behaviors lead to dysfunction in social interactions or activities of daily living and cannot be attributed to another condition.12 The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory is the best known validated instrument designed to assign severity to observable behaviors.12
In the early 2000s, regulatory agencies published advisories about increases in CVAE and death in older patients with dementia-related psychosis who were taking antipsychotics.7 In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration began requiring changes to prescribing information, outlining the risk for risperidone. Boxed warnings for all second-generation or atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) followed in 2005, after meta-analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials showed that older patients with dementia taking these drugs were 1.6 to 1.7 times more likely to die than those not taking them. 7 Regulatory agencies in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Europe raised similar concerns, finding a significant increase in CVAE and death. 7 A 2011 literature review by Mittal et al further elucidated the problem, revealing a 1.3 to 2 times higher risk for CVAE  and a 1.2 to 1.6 times higher risk for death in patients taking AAPs than in those not taking these drugs.⁶ In their discussion, Mittal and his group hypothesized that orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia leading to cerebral hypoperfusion could be a potential mechanisms of CVAE in this setting. Another proposed mechanism is thrombus formation and thromboembolism secondary to hemoconcentration due to dehydration in an oversedated patient. Deaths are attributed to cardiovascular events such as arrhythmias related to QTc prolongation and infections, particularly pneumonia.7
In 2014, the Detroit Expert Panel on the Assessment and Management of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms of Dementia proposed a new framework for assessing BPSD known as The DICE Approach.4 DICE stands for Describe, Investigate, Create, and Evaluate. The approach allows for a patient-centered management strategy that prioritizes evidence-based, nonpharmacologic environmental and behavioral interventions to address BPSD.13 Using The DICE Approach, a caregiver “describes problematic behavior,” including details about the context and degree of distress caused, while a provider “investigates possible causes” of the behavior, considering medication side effects, pain, sleep, and sensory changes. The caregiver and provider then “collaborate to create” a comprehensive treatment plan that begins with nonpharmacologic interventions, such as improved caregiver education, enhanced communication skills, and modification of the patient’s environment.13 The provider meets later with the caregiver to evaluate whether the treatment plan has been safe and effective and to reevaluate where needed. Although the panel recommended against the initialuse of psychotropic medication to treat/manage BPSD, the DICE algorithm allows for consideration of medications at each stage after the problem has been defined and clarified. Exceptions are made for situations in which the behavior presents imminent risk to the well-being of, or overt harm to, the patient or care providers. For example, depression with or without suicidal ideation, and physically aggressive behaviors, whether due to psychosis or disinhibition, represent situations that potentially are harmful to the patient or caregiver.4
AAPs as a class have a higher affinity for serotonin type 2 receptors and less affinity for dopamine D2 receptors than first-generation antipsychotics. Though it varies from drug to drug, antagonism at alpha 1- and 2- adrenergic receptors, as well as histaminergic receptors, may result in characteristic side effects such as tachycardia or sedation.9 AAPs are metabolized mainly by the cytochrome P450 system enzymes.9 Competition for these enzymes may result in increased or decreased bioavailability and altered half-lives of AAPs, factors that should be considered when titrating and tapering dosages, transitioning to other antipsychotics, or discontinuing these agents.
When prescribing psychotropic medication, knowledge of common and potentially serious adverse effects is of primary importance. Side effects common to AAPs include, but are not limited to, weight gain, somnolence or insomnia, agitation, anxiety, headache, and sexual dysfunction.9 Because many of these drugs exhibit anticholinergic activity, patients may experience dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, or urinary retention. More serious side effects include extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as akathisia, parkinsonism, and dystonia. Rarely, tardive dyskinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a medical emergency, may develop.9 Patients taking AAPs should be evaluated routinely for EPS.
Because elderly patients are more likely to take multiple medications, the potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered. AAPs are known to prolong the QTc interval, which can precipitate potentially fatal cardiac dysrhythmias.9 In addition, in this population, the risk for falls due to somnolence or orthostatic hypotension must be considered and mitigated.
In 2023, the FDA approved brexpiprazole for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer dementia. Prior to this, no AAP had been approved for this indication. Brexpiprazole is considered a serotonin dopamine activity modulator that works as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A (serotonin) and dopamine D2 receptors and an antagonist at 5HT2A receptors.9 Its reduced effects at muscarinic, alpha-adrenergic, and histaminic receptors increase its tolerability relative to others in the class.6
Brexpiprazole demonstrated safety and efficacy in randomized, placebo-controlled trials in which the measured end points were reduction of scores on agitation rating scales.5 Because brexpiprazole has a half-life of 91 hours, it is effective when administered once daily, with an optimal dose for efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 2 mg per day (Table 2).5,9
In 2015, in response to calls for recommendations based on the strength of evidence found in the medical literature, the American Psychiatric Association published practice guidelines for the use of antipsychotics in the treatment of agitation and psychosis in dementia patients. The guidelines are based on the consensus of a writing group and expert surveys and consist of 15 statements in 5 categories 1) Assessment of BPSD 2) Development of a Comprehensive Treatment Plan 3) Assessment of Benefits and Risks of Antipsychotic Treatment for the Patient 4) Dosing, Duration and Monitoring of Antipsychotic Treatment and 5) Use of Specific Antipsychotic Medications, Depending on Clinical Context.14 A summary of the statements is found in Table 3.15
Helping patients and family members navigate BPSD is a large part of providing care to people living with dementia. A combination of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions usually is needed to address what can be distressing and disruptive symptoms adequately, and this may include the use of AAPs. Understanding the pharmacology and being informed about the risks of using these drugs are first steps to safely prescribing them. Evaluation of individual patient risk factors for CVAE, discussion of risks and benefits with surrogate decision-makers and/or family caregivers should inform shared medical decision-making that prioritizes quality of life for both patients and caregivers.  Use of the DICE framework and APA Practice Guideline enables clinicians to equip themselves with skills and strategies for managing challenging behaviors while appropriately prescribing AAPs.","Michele Matlock, MS, PA-C"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/color-in-health-care-design-spaces/,Color in Health Care: How Mindful Design Can Improve Clinical Spaces,"Color is a key component of any professional branding or design endeavor, and the use of color in health care settings is no exception. Although color psychology has the potential to affect patient experiences and outcomes, it remains relatively underexplored relative to its extensive use in marketing.1 As research consistently demonstrates the profound impact of color on consumer behavior, there is a compelling case for applying these insights to patient floors, waiting rooms, and physician branding.
Decision-making regarding the use of specific colors in health care spaces appears to be largely based on general psychological research and well-established color theory used in art and design. However, the results of several recent studies suggest that the strategic use of color may enhance the patient experience in health care settings.
For example, a study published in 2023 in the Health Environments Research and Design Journal (HERD) examined the utility of strategic color changes to improve wayfinding in the redesign of an emergency department in Sweden.2 In this study, common patient areas were painted solid neutral colors (gray/beige), while patient-restricted areas were painted red or other colors that contrasted with the neutral patient areas and floors were given a darker shade near the walls to highlight the boundaries of rooms. Based on participant responses on self-report questionnaires that were created and validated by the investigators, the new design was associated with an increased perception of awareness, orientation, and safety among patients and family members compared to the previous design.2
In addition to improving navigation in a hospital setting, a 2022 prospective, randomized controlled trial by Eminovic et al investigated the effect of incorporating a range of lighter colors (as selected by an art theorist) as well as art containing the same colors into hospital rooms of patients recovering from total hip or knee arthroplasty. Relative to patients in the control group who had rooms with no additional color, patients in lighter-colored rooms showed significantly higher scores on assessments of postoperative quality of life.3
Beyond the actual shades of color in health care settings, investigators have also examined how tones and saturation affect clinical settings. Research published in HERD in January 2024 also evaluated the use of color in health care by examining how ambulatory waiting room characteristics affected the emotions of 1114 women aged 18 to 35 years in the United States. Investigators found that patients prefer rooms with neutral color saturation relative to high or low saturation spaces – regardless of color.4
Further, results of a 2020 study of nursing home residents in Spain revealed that individuals exhibit a preference for warm colors (especially yellow) in activity rooms and a preference for cooler colors (especially green) in bedrooms. Using virtual reality and heart rate variability assessment, the researchers also found that warm colors were associated with higher levels of arousal relative to cool colors. The greatest arousal based on heart rate variability was observed in the yellow activity room, and the lowest arousal was observed in the blue activity room.5
Despite its success in commercial environments, the deliberate use of color in health care remains surprisingly limited, offering a unique opportunity to harness these principles for more empathetic and effective medical spaces. Although additional research using rigorous methodology is needed before color strategies in health care spaces can be considered evidence-based, the aesthetic and practical effects of the intentional use of color remain important considerations in these settings. By strategically incorporating color psychology into health care settings, designers can potentially increase patient comfort, reduce anxiety, and improve overall satisfaction.
To further explore this topic, Psychiatry Advisor interviewed Michelle Lewis, a color psychology expert who specializes in design, marketing, and behavioral color research.
Lewis: My start in color psychology began in my youth, as my parents were in the film industry. The emotional impact of a story presented in a visual medium was a huge focus, and color was a crucial component of the film’s production design. As I moved my work online and worked more in the branding and marketing space, I saw firsthand how injecting color affected an audience’s perception and emotions regarding physical and digital products and services.
However, I didn’t yet have enough of a knowledge base to understand why, so I decided that I needed to study color throughout history, culture, art, religion, medicine, and more to comprehend how it would interact with people physically, mentally, and emotionally today across the world.
In pouring over research materials, books, studies, and experiments for a solid 6 months, I started to see common threads between what I call the primary 8 communication colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, and magenta. I ultimately wrote a book,Color Secrets: Learning the One Universal Language We Were Never Taught, that encapsulated all of my research.6 Through experimenting with clients and students, it became clear to me that color was truly a universal language that made a major impact when used intentionally.
This work has led to collaborations with clients who want to blend color psychology with their expertise to clearly communicate with their target audience in a more emotional and supportive way. I’ve also had the honor of working with neurodivergent children as well as adults with chronic fatigue and multiple sclerosis to support them with color, aiding in increased feelings of well-being. It’s been incredibly powerful and rewarding work that branches into so many aspects of life.
Lewis: The power of color psychology has been a relatively untapped resource for most health care organizations due to the lack of knowledge of its efficacy in a strictly scientific modality. However, even this year, an increasing number of spaces are becoming aware of and starting to strategically use color in their facilities. The ability to link specific colors – and even the undertones of certain colors – to clearly communicate and influence a patient’s physical and emotional states is hugely significant.
We typically see the most intentional use of color in children’s health care settings with an assortment of rainbow colors. This is to help children feel more comfortable and to elicit emotions of joy, growth, and positivity. Some great examples of this approach are the New Lady Cilento Children’s Hospital and the Bendigo Hospital in Australia.
The biggest issue with the use of color in health care is intentionality. For example, because red may increase heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil dilation, this is a color to avoid in most health care settings, as it may cause higher levels of stress, especially in cases of physical, emotional, or mental trauma.7-9 This is why the color red has been tied to emergency services, especially since red is the color we first recognize and respond to with attention and alertness.10
However, the color blue measurably reduces heart rate and blood pressure, so it can be used in many health care spaces to bring feelings of calm and stress reduction.7,8 We also see blue used within most health care logos, hospitals, and treatment facilities.
According to my research, the 8 colors I have listed are the only ones that create a measurable response in the body. White, black, gray, and brown are great to use in support of the eight primary communication colors, but by themselves do not evoke a measurable response.
Lewis: To begin putting the color pieces together for a health care space, the best research study I recommend starting with is Sarah Babin’s “Color Theory: The Effects of Color in Medical Environments.” This paper provides a great foundation to color study in the medical field and how to approach the conversation of color decisions.11
For example, within the study, she discovered that 49.1% of participants preferred cooler colors, while 29.1% favored warmer colors. What’s interesting about this finding is that cooler colors can evoke a much more calming reaction, especially when they are given a gray undertone. Within a health care setting, the use of cool colors could be prioritized before even deciding on the specific colors. Then, it’s possible to niche into the specific medical setting to determine the exact shades to use.
In a mental health space, for example, I would avoid reds and yellows entirely, as they may cause too much of a physiological reaction. Even though many people associate yellow with happiness, this color would have to be given white or gray undertones to dilute the potential effects of stress on the nervous system. I also would also avoid using darker blues, as they could cause patients to retreat too deeply into their own thoughts.
In more general health care settings, there are certain “safe” colors that usually cause a much more predictable, positive reaction. In my experience, these are often cool-toned blues, teals, and greens. Blue is more mentally stimulating while inducing a calming reaction to the heart rate and blood pressure.7,8 Green tends to be stabilizing, encouraging balance of body and mind.
For pediatric health care settings, the undertone of the chosen colors is key. Most children respond positively to white-tinted colors, which means they have a white undertone. Think of pastels – they feel and look brighter, lighter, and happier.
It’s interesting to note that some colors may cause certain reactions that could be helpful to experiment with. For example, it would be interesting to test red in the room of a child struggling with blood circulation, as red is known to increase blood flow, or to utilize orange in a room for a child who struggles with insomnia, as it may help to improve sleep.12
I think the most important takeaway is to understand that color is participatory. It can change per person and per setting, as its basis is light. Because light is made of frequency, it can permeate the cellular makeup of the body. And, as light can alter from wave to particle with the presence of a person – as proven by the double-slit experiment – we have to respect color’s ability to respond to us.13
Lewis: When consulting with a color psychologist, it starts with a lot of questions that are best answered by the practitioner and potentially some of their top clients who can give real-time feedback while building the visuals of the site.
When creating a medical setting, certain considerations must be taken into account. Here are some questions I like to ask as a color psychologist working in a new space:
These considerations are all very helpful when creating a color experience in a physical space.
Once a foundation is laid in terms of color direction, the color psychologist or designer will create mood boards of potential “looks” of color within the space. The practitioner will choose the favorite look, and then more detailed mockups will be created.
The next step is bringing the design to life at the site. Walkthroughs are done by the practitioner, staff, and past clients to see reactions and get feedback. If needed, additions and adjustments are made before the space receives final approval.
Since color psychology is a newer field, [decision makers at health care facilities] may connect with an interior designer and request that they either subcontract a color psychologist or receive color training from one.
Lewis: I would say, with the strongest passion possible, to please utilize this underused tool in your facility. Color can be the most powerful way to make someone feel something. To not focus on color when creating a space that patients, practitioners, and staff will spend an abundant amount of time in is like leaving a crucial tool on the table unused.
For example, even including pops of yellow for employees who spend most of the day sitting may provide a needed burst of energy. Or, for certain offices, there could be a “resting room” where employees can reset their vision with the color green and enjoy a well-earned break from fluorescent lighting.
The gray matter in our brain responds incredibly quickly to new knowledge about color, so start digging into the available resources to learn more.14 I recommend that people exercise caution when exploring information about color psychology. Random internet searching will lead down a rabbit hole of opinions that are usually unresearched. Focus on the National Institutes of Health studies, academic papers, and books written on the subject with extensive bibliographies.
As you explore, you can start imaging the places at your facility that may be positively impacted by color – whether it’s your advertising, website, waiting room, patient room, or even exit space. Pick one and start there!
My honor is simply sharing my research on color in every way possible. One of the biggest needs, as a former ill child myself, is leaning on color’s ability to assist in feeling while healing. We are electromagnetic beings, so the introduction of color in any way throughout a treatment or healing journey can be powerful, as the body always responds. As we inject more color strategically into health care spaces, I believe we will see revolutionary results.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/managing-obesity-older-adults/,Breaking Down Barriers to Obesity Care for Older Adults,"Almost 31% of older adults in the United States live with obesity. Excess weight puts strains on joints and can lead to mobility issues, pulmonary dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, and increases the risk of certain cancers. However, there are several barriers older adults face when trying to access obesity care, according to research presented at the Gerontological Advanced Practice Nurses Association (GAPNA 2024) annual meeting, held from September 12 to 14, 2024, in San Antonio, Texas.
The Gerontological Society of America (GSA) conducted a roundtable discussion about access to the full continuum of obesity care for older adults. Jennifer L. Pettis, MS, RN, CNE, Director of Strategic Alliances at GSA, presented findings from this discussion at GAPNA 2024. Based on this discussion, GSA noted that stigma and misconceptions about obesity affect older adults’ ability to access quality obesity care.
Despite obesity being recognized as a chronic disease by the American Medical Association, obesity is still not perceived as a chronic disease like other conditions by many clinicians. Weight-based attitudes and biases from clinicians can affect patients’ ability and desire to seek care, Ms Pettis said. Viewing obesity as a disease and confronting sizeism and ageism in medical settings is crucial to preventing further harm, GSA concluded.
The roundtable discussion yielded 7 strategies for success:
GSA developed a toolkit for primary care providers to implement the Kickstart, Assess, Evaluate, Refer (KAER) framework for managing obesity in older adults. The KAER framework is not unique to obesity care; it was initially developed as a framework for improving outcomes for patients with dementia. The toolkit explains how the 4 steps of the KAER framework are designed to facilitate discussions about weight and spur the development of individualized care plans.
Prior to implementing the KAER framework primary care providers should assess whether they or members of their staff hold biases about overweight or obesity. This assessment may include questions like “How do I feel when I work with patients of different body sizes?” or “What stereotypes do I have about people with obesity?”
In addition to the KAER framework, the toolkit includes tips for speaking with older patients, said Ms Pettis. Some of these tips are regarding communication, such as avoiding patronizing language, monitoring nonverbal communication, using visual aids, and asking open-ended questions; others are intended to optimize interactions between older adults and health care professionals in other ways, such as engaging in shared decision making, including the patient in the conversation even if their companion is with them in the room, and setting goals for listener comprehension.
There are 7 steps to implementing the Kickstart phase of the KAER framework, the first of which is staff education. This education should include training on all currently available obesity management methods, including lifestyle changes, medication, and surgery, in addition to training on reducing bias and stigma around obesity.
The second implementation step in the Kickstart phase is to prepare for shared decision-making with older adults with obesity. The GSA advises clinicians to modify the 5As (ask, assess, advise, assist, arrange) often used for smoking cessation to 6As by adding “agree,” indicating that providers will work with patients to develop specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-based goals for managing obesity, Ms Pettis said.
The next step is to engage patients in conversations about obesity before they arrive for their visit by providing information through the patient’s electronic health portal. The fourth implementation step is to ensure that the older adult is comfortable in the care environment when they arrive for their visit. For example, teams should ensure that there is furniture in the waiting room that is comfortable for any body size.
When the visit begins, providers should ask permission from the patient before measuring their weight or initiating a conversation about their weight; this is the fifth step of the implementation process. The sixth step is to recognize how cultural differences can affect perceptions about body size and conversations about weight.
Finally, clinicians should discuss the importance of healthy living at every body size and age when kickstarting conversations about obesity.
GSA stresses the importance of looking beyond body mass index (BMI) when assessing patients with obesity and planning interventions, and including other measurements, such as waist circumference, presence of concomitant diseases, and medications, in a patient’s assessment.
All older adults diagnosed with overweight or obesity should be screened for sarcopenic obesity as well as diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and liver disease, Ms Pettis said. If it is necessary to add new members to an older adult’s care team, such as a dietitian or physical therapist, primary care providers should acclimate the patient to any changes.
Conversations about obesity management options that are the best fit fora patient’s circumstances should be empathetic and compassionate, and any goals established with the patient should be based on percentage loss of total body weight.
The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and The Obesity Society provide guidelines that can help develop treatment plans for obesity in older adults.
Exercise recommendations should fit in with any constraints individual patients face with time, money, or physical limitations. Medication to manage obesity may be appropriate for patients who have not reached their target body weight after 3 months of dietary and exercise changes. Bariatric surgery may be appropriate for patients with a BMI between 30 kg/m2 and 34.9 kg/m2 who have type 2 diabetes, patients with a BMI between 35 kg/m2 and 39.9 kg/m2 with comorbidities, or patients with a BMI higher than 39.9 kg/m2.
The final step of the KAER framework to manage obesity is to refer older adults to community, online, or national resources that can be of assistance during their lifelong journey with weight management. Leveraging technology such as fitness apps or online exercise resources may be helpful for digitally savvy older adults.
It is important in this phase to emphasize the chronic nature of obesity and work with the patient to maintain their target body size long-term.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/sleep-nighttime-agitation-in-older-adults/,Sleep and Nighttime Agitation in Older Adults with Cognitive Decline,"Interventions to manage sleep disturbances such as restless leg syndrome (RLS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and insomnia are crucial to improve sleep, cognition, and nighttime behavioral symptoms in older adults with cognitive decline, according to research presented at the Gerontological Advanced Practice Nurses Association (GAPNA 2024) annual meeting, held from September 12 to September 14, 2024, in San Antonio, Texas.
Kathy Richards, PhD, RN, FAAN, FAASM, of the University of Texas at Austin School of Nursing, presented cases of sleep disturbances in older adults at GAPNA 2024. In her presentation, Dr Richards outlined intervention strategies for nighttime agitation, RLS, OSA, and insomnia in older patients with cognitive decline.
Among the nearly 7 million patients in the United States with dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD), agitation and sleep disturbance are prevalent symptoms; nighttime agitation, sometimes referred to as “sundowning” occurs in 66% of older adults with dementia.1
An older adult experiencing nighttime agitation may become upset or angry, shout, scream, wander, pace, seek exits,  or show physical aggression. These symptoms can be challenging for caregivers and result in institutionalization, driving up costs, Dr Richards said.
About 50% to 75% of patients with AD experience sleep disturbances, which are classified as difficulty falling asleep, increased nighttime awakenings, decreased non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep, increased daytime napping, and high levels of activity throughout the night.2
While there is no clearly defined cause of nighttime agitation among older adults with AD, it is known that agitation behaviors stem from unmet needs. Additional theories on the etiology of nighttime agitation include issues with circadian rhythm, insufficient daylight, fatigue, and side effects of medication, Dr. Richards said.
The prevalence of RLS in the general population is between 4% to 29%.3 The prevalence of RLS among older adults with dementia is likely higher than that of the general population due to the high prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in patients with dementia (25%-50%), age, sex (RLS and dementia are both more common in female patients), inactivity, and medications.4 For example, 17% of patients with dementia take antipsychotics, and 25% to 50% of patients with dementia take antidepressants, Dr Richards said.
In a study that included 76 long term care and independent living residents, fewer minutes slept and iron deficiency were linked to more frequent nighttime agitation behaviors, reported Dr Richards.
A definitive RLS diagnosis can be made after reviewing a patient’s sleep/wake actigraphy (if available), medical history, physical examination data, and results from the Behavioral Indicators Test-Restless Legs (BIT-RL).5 Dr Richards and her colleagues developed the BIT-RL to provide a diagnostic tool suitable for patients with dementia who are unable to reliably answer the RLS Diagnostic Interview. Patients can score between 0 and 16 on the BIT-RL; higher scores indicate a positive RLS diagnosis.
Gabapentin enacarbil (GEn) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat RLS; the medication has a favorable safety profile. From a nonpharmacological perspective, regular exercise, abstinence from caffeine and alcohol, and improved sleep hygiene are effective in reducing RLS symptoms. Dr Richards also recommends, when possible, reducing or eliminating medications including neuroleptics, antidepressants, gastrointestinal medications, or lithium can help alleviate RLS symptoms.
There is evidence to indicate that adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to manage OSA is associated with slower cognitive decline. In a study by Dr. Richards and colleagues of 174 patients with OSA and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 73.6% were adherent to their CPAP treatment plan, defined as an average of 4 or more hours of CPAP use per night. However, this was not equal among different races and ethnicities.
There were 38 Black participants in the study; 18 (47.4%) were CPAP adherent, indicating a need for more research and culturally tailored interventions to improve CPAP adherence among Black patients.6
“Increasingly diverse clinical trials are necessary to improve interventions for older adults with cognitive decline who experience sleep disturbances,” Dr. Richards said. Although Hispanic Americans are the largest minority group in the country, they are underrepresented in clinical trials despite being 1.5 times more likely to have Alzheimer’s disease compared with White older adults, she added.
Insomnia is defined as having difficulty falling or staying asleep after ample time in an environment conducive for sleep; this difficulty causes daytime symptoms including sleepiness or difficulty concentrating. In older adults, insomnia is associated with faster cognitive decline, increased stress for both the patient and their caregivers, reduced quality of life, and institutionalization, Dr Richards said.
Disruptions to older adults’ circadian rhythms, including lack of physical or social activity during the day, excessive daytime napping, lack of daytime light, and neuronal changes in the circadian timekeeping system, can all contribute to insomnia. Some of these issues are exacerbated in long-term care environments where patients spend excessive time in bed, there is nighttime noise from staff and other residents, and patients are awakened by staff for care throughout the night.
While the FDA has approved multiple medications to treat insomnia, nonpharmacological strategies are the first-line treatment to manage insomnia in older adults, Dr. Richards said. Clinical trial results indicate that there is a lack of awareness of nonpharmacological management options for insomnia among clinicians. In a study of 143 older adults with severe nighttime agitation, 45% of the nurse aides caring for the patients were unable to name one nonpharmacological strategy to manage insomnia that was in use for patients in the study population, Dr Richards said.
Nonpharmacological strategies to manage insomnia in older adults include cognitive behavioral therapy, bright light exposure, increased physical and social activity, creating a bedtime ritual, relaxing music at bedtime, and going to bed after the sun has set, she said.
Dr Richards disclosed that she is a consultant for Merck Pharmaceuticals and received study drug and matching placebo from Arbor Pharmaceuticals for an NIH-funded clinical trial.  Arbor had no role in the conceptualization, conduction, or reporting of the trial.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/reopen-shuttered-hospital-new-federal-program/,Rural NC County Is Set To Reopen Its Shuttered Hospital With Help From a New Federal Program,"KFF Health News — WILLIAMSTON, NC — On a mid-August morning, Christopher Harrison stood in front of the shuttered Martin General Hospital recalling the day a year earlier when he snapped pictures as workers covered the facility’s sign.
“Yes, sir. It was a sad day,” Harrison said of the financial collapse of the small rural hospital, where all four of his children were born.
Quorum Health operated the 49-bed facility in this rural eastern North Carolina town of about 5000 residents until it closed. The hospital had been losing money for some time. The county’s population has slightly declined and is aging; it has experienced incremental economic downturns. Like many rural hospitals, those headwinds drove managers to discontinue labor and delivery services and halt intensive care during the past 5 years.
Prospects for reopening seemed dim.
But a new hospital designation by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that took effect last year offered hope. As of August, hospitals in 32 communities around the country have converted to the rural emergency hospital designation to prevent closure. The new program provides a federal financial boost for struggling hospitals that keep offering emergency and outpatient services but halt inpatient care.
The REH model “is not designed to replace existing, well-functioning rural hospitals,” said George Pink, PhD, a senior research fellow at the University of North Carolina’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, which has documented 149 rural hospitals that have either closed or no longer provide inpatient care since 2010. “It really is targeted at small rural communities that are at imminent risk of a hospital closing.”
The program hasn’t yet been used to reopen a closed hospital.
With guidance from health consultants, Martin County officials asked federal regulators to explore the possibility of adopting the REH model and were ultimately given the go-ahead.
If successful, Martin County could become one of the first in the nation to convert a shuttered hospital to this new model.
Ask members of a community that has lost its hospital what they miss most, Pink said, and it’s almost invariably emergency services. Count Harrison among them, especially after a medical crisis nearly killed him.
Harrison, who lives in a smaller crossroads community a few miles south of Williamston, began experiencing leg pain in February. Under normal circumstances, Harrison said, he would have gone to his primary care doctor if his leg began to hurt. This time he couldn’t, because the practice closed when the hospital folded months earlier.
Then, one morning he awoke to find his foot turning black. It took him 45 minutes to drive to the closest hospital, in the town of Washington. There, doctors found blood clots and he was flown by helicopter to East Carolina University Health Medical Center. A doctor there told him that he’d probably had the blood clots for close to a year and that he was lucky to be alive. The medical team was able to save his foot from amputation.
Harrison, like many other community members, now had firsthand experience with the consequences of a shuttered hospital.
The state legislature’s decision last year to expand Medicaid has meant fewer North Carolinians are uninsured, which means fewer hospital bills go unpaid. But health care is evolving: Many procedures that once required inpatient care are now performed as outpatient services. Dawn Carter, the founder and a senior partner of Ascendient, a health care consulting firm working with the county, said the inpatient census at Martin General in its last few years ranged from 5 or 6 a day to a dozen.
“So you’re talking about a lot of cost, a lot of infrastructure to support that,” she said.
With no emergency care within a half-hour radius, Martin County administrators believe a rural emergency hospital would be a good fit and a viable option. REH status allows a hospital to collect enhanced Medicare payments, an annual facility payment, and technical assistance.
Carter said the team will present to the state Department of Health and Human Services a set of drawings of the portion of the building they intend to use to see if it meets REH regulations.
“I’m hoping that process is happening in the next several weeks,” she said, “and that will give us a better idea of whether we have a handful of really quick and easy things to do or if it’s going to take a little more effort to reopen.”
Officials then will take proposals from companies interested in running the hospital.
Carter said the expectation is that, initially, the facility will be strictly the emergency room and imaging department, “and then I think the question is, over time, where do you build beyond that?”
And the rebuilding could prove a challenge from the start. Many former staff members have taken positions at nearby health care facilities or left the area. The effects of that exodus will be compounded by the widespread difficulty in recruiting health workers to rural areas.
It’s early yet, Pink said, to assess the success of the rural emergency hospital model. “All we have are armchair anecdotes.” It seems to be working well in some communities, while others “are struggling a little to make it work.”
Pink has a list of questions to assess how an emergency hospital is faring in the long run:
The rate of rural hospital closures rose through 2020, then dropped considerably in 2021. Congress had passed the CARES Act, and the Provider Relief Fund offered a financial lifeline, Pink said. That money has now been distributed, and the concern is that “many rural hospitals are returning to pre-COVID financial stresses and unprofitability.”
If the trend continues, he said, more rural hospitals may turn to the REH model.
Ben Eisner serves as Martin County’s attorney and interim manager. He acknowledges that the health and well-being of this community require a lot more than a hospital. He cites, for example, a new nonprofit with a mission to address the social determinants of health.
Advancing Community Health Together was created in response to the hospital closure. Composed of community members, its focus is addressing inadequate health care access and poor health outcomes as a consequence of generational poverty, said Vickey Manning, director of Martin-Tyrrell-Washington District Health.
“We can’t address rural health care in a vacuum,” Carter said. Her organization, Ascendient, is part of the Rural Healthcare Initiative, a nonprofit commissioned by the North Carolina General Assembly to study sustainable models of health care for rural communities.
Like most of rural eastern North Carolina, Martin County is in transition, Eisner said. Diminishing family farms, less industry. “And so the question becomes,” he said, “‘What happens for all these communities? What happens next?’ And it’s an answer that is not yet fully written.”
Harrison, still relying on crutches to get around, recently drove 45 minutes north on US 13 to the town of Ahoskie to have a doctor examine his foot. He said a hospital that offers basic emergency care isn’t a perfect solution, but he’ll have some peace of mind once the cover is peeled from that sign and his local hospital reopens.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/masld-and-obesity/,MASLD and Obesity: How Managing Weight Can Help With Liver Disease,"Our easy-to-read fact sheets provide clinicians with reliable information to share with patients and their caregivers.
Previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the term was changed to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in 2023 to better reflect the nature of the condition and allow for more accurate diagnoses. Patients with MASLD have fat accumulation (steatosis) in their organs or liver (steatohepatitis) and at least 1 cardiometabolic risk factor, such as high blood pressure.1 Approximately 30% of adults worldwide have MASLD, with the prevalence increasing every year over the past 3 decades.2
If left unchecked, MASLD can result in end-stage liver failure and have adverse implications on other tissues in the body, leading to a reduced quality of life. Patients diagnosed with MASLD are more likely to have other health conditions, such as chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. Cardiovascular disease, nonhepatic malignancy, and liver disease are the most common causes of mortality in MASLD patients.3
MASLD is a spectrum of disorders that includes the progression of simple steatosis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), cirrhosis, and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MASH is a more severe form of steatosis that presents with inflammation and fibrosis. Cirrhosis is an irreversible condition in which the liver fails due to excessive scarring, and HCC is a type of liver cancer.4
MASLD and obesity are closely linked, with experts estimating that 80% of patients with MASLD have obesity.2 The World Health Organization defines obesity as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that poses a risk to health, with a body mass index (BMI) score over 30. Since 1990, obesity rates in adults have more than doubled, while adolescent obesity rates have quadrupled.5
Patients with obesity tend to have greater fat accumulation within their organs, including the liver. Excess fat may also result in increased inflammation, which contributes to the progression of MASLD to more severe disease states. Research suggests that individuals with obesity have a significantly higher risk of developing MASLD, cirrhosis, and HCC.2
Lifestyle changes that result in weight loss can reduce steatosis and the subsequent metabolic-inflammatory stress. Studies have shown that in patients with MASLD who also have overweight/obesity, weight loss can also lead to regression of MASH and fibrosis.2 Even patients with MASLD who do not have obesity can benefit from weight loss.
Patients are recommended to opt for food choices that promote cardiovascular health while minimizing consumption of foods that are closely associated with MASLD development, including processed foods, sugary beverages, red meat, and excess saturated fats, cholesterol, and refined carbohydrates, such as bacon, cheese, and cereal. Research has pointed to low carbohydrate, low fat, intermittent fasting, and Mediterranean diets as having potential metabolic, cardiovascular, and liver benefits.1
Exercise improves muscle function, which can have positive effects on the liver. Aerobic exercise, such as walking or stationary biking, along with resistance training, such as weight training, are examples of physical activity that have been shown to significantly decrease liver fat.6
Bariatric surgery is another weight loss method that can be effective in individuals who have morbid obesity and have MASLD without cirrhosis.1 This option requires extensive consultation with a physician to determine whether this is the best clinical decision for the patient. These factors, regardless of whether they contribute to weight loss or not, are beneficial in improving MASLD.
There are a variety of pharmacological interventions patients with MASLD can use to manage their obesity. Below are available medications that have demonstrated positive effects in patients with MASH. While none have been approved for the specific indication, some may be used off-label and for obesity. Patients should consult with their doctor to see which option is best for them.
Yes, patients who stop taking weight loss medications, such as semaglutide, may regain weight. One study found that patients regained two-thirds of the weight they had lost 1 year after stopping semaglutide.8 This underscores the importance of maintaining other healthy lifestyle habits while taking medication.
Getting an adequate amount and quality of sleep every night is important when managing obesity. Research has shown that there is a link between sleep loss and obesity, as individuals experiencing sleep deprivation tend to have increased desire for high-calorie foods.99
Stress is also connected to obesity and increases weight-promoting hormones in the body. Mindfulness-based exercises, such as meditation and mindful yoga stretches, are ways patients can reduce their stress.10
Sex hormones can have varying effects on obesity depending on the hormone and the sex of the individual. Obesity is associated with lower testosterone levels in men and higher androgen levels in women. When it comes to hormonal contraceptives, they will still be generally effective in women with obesity. Gender-affirming hormone therapy and other sex hormone-containing medications may result in further weight gain; thus, patients should consult their physician regarding further steps.11

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/managing-postmenopausal-weight-gain-starts-behavioral-changes/,Managing Postmenopausal Weight Gain Starts With Behavioral Changes Before Menopause,"Postmenopausal weight gain is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. That is why it is crucial to help women maintain a healthy weight as they reach menopause, according to Donna Willenbrock, DNP, ANP-C, assistant professor of nursing at Hofstra University, Hempstead, NY, and owner of Thin Possible Adult Health NP PLLC, a program that helps women reach their healthy weight loss goals.
Menopause marks the end of a woman’s reproductive years. When estrogen levels drop as menopause starts, usually between age 40 to 58, women experience variable menstrual cycles and decrease in ovulation. When estrogen levels decrease, so do those protective effects. “Women experience a decrease in hunger suppression, decrease in basal metabolism, increase in free radicals, and increase in low-grade inflammation. These changes can contribute to weight gain,” Dr Willenbrock told The Clinical Advisor during an interview at the recent American Association of Nurse Practitioners annual meeting in Nashville.
In addition to the well-known menopausal symptoms, women gain, on average, 1 lb per year during menopause. Menopausal weight gain is most commonly associated with increases in abdominal subcutaneous and visceral tissues, which contributes to higher rates of the disease of obesity. People who gain weight after reaching menopause are also at higher risk of developing breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and metabolic syndrome.
“After menopause, [people] have potentially 30 more years [of life],” Dr Willenbrock said. “We want to make them 30 good years. We don’t want to be frail. We don’t want to have to be in a nursing home. You want to enjoy those grandchildren and everything else in life.”
The best time to start thinking about how to manage postmenopausal weight gain is during the perimenopausal phase when patients still have some of estrogen’s protective effects.
“I start my discussion of weight management with nutrition first. The first thing I advise women to do is to start tracking what they’re eating. Because believe it or not, many of us have no idea how many calories we’re taking in,” Dr Willenbrock said. “We either overestimate or underestimate our caloric intake”.
With a better understanding of a patient’s nutritional habits, Dr Willenbrock is able to make recommendations during the perimenopausal phase to prevent weight gain after menopause. She stressed the importance of making nutritional recommendations that are realistic and practical for each individual to increase the chances that the patient will adhere to dietary recommendations.
“I have people look at what they’re eating. Then we try to take away 500 calories,” she said. “If we do something dramatic — say you’re eating 2000 calories and then we go down to 1000 — you’re going to be hungry. You’re going to be cranky and angry and, miserable and you’re not going to stick with it. People ask me all the time, ‘What’s the best diet to be on?’ And there’s no one great diet. It’s the thing you’re going to stick with. It has to be an individualized plan.”
While there is no one-size-fits-all diet that is recommended for postmenopausal women, there are a few general dietary recommendations that can be helpful to manage postmenopausal weight gain. The composition of the diet is important. Dr Willenbrock recommends a diet composed of:
Low calorie diets (1200-2000 cal/d) that are low in sugar and fat but high in fruits, vegetables, and grains can be effective for postmenopausal weight loss. The notion that it is possible to fully control hormones through diet is a common misconception, but Dr Willenbrock outlined several strategies that may be helpful for women who are trying to lose weight after menopause.
These strategies include smaller portion sizes, reducing intake of processed foods, increasing intake of energy-dense foods, taking meal replacements (short-term), practicing volume eating, drinking water before meals, and meal planning. Ultimately, the most effective strategy is the strategy that the patient is most likely to adhere to long-term, Dr Willenbrock explained.
Protein intake becomes especially important after menopause because of loss of lean muscle mass. “What I say to people is I prefer them to take in 30 grams of protein every meal if they can,” Dr Willenbrock said. “We start to work on that. What does that look like? What foods would you eat that have that kind of protein in them? You may eat eggs, but that’s not enough protein. So we want to add something additional to that. Is there another lean meat or maybe a lean cheese that you might add, or some nuts to that to try to make sure that at every meal we get that lean protein?”
Many menopausal women lead sedentary lifestyles due to their jobs. Not only can this lead to weight gain, it also leads to a loss of skeletal muscle mass. Therefore, Dr Willenbrock works with her patients to incorporate regular exercise into their routines in addition to dietary changes.
Women who have reached menopause should do aerobic (great for heart health) and resistance training on a weekly basis and complete full-body strength training at least twice a week. She recommends women work up to:
“Because we need that lean muscle mass that we start to lose as we get older, we know that resistance exercise makes a difference,” Dr Willenbrock said.
Stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated lack of exercise and access to nutritious food for many postmenopausal women, Dr Willenbrock explained.
While the pandemic complicated behavioral factors necessary to maintain a healthy weight, it also created stress for many people. Stress is closely tied to postmenopausal weight gain, as changes in cortisol levels affect weight.
Dr Willenbrock lost patients at her weight management clinic because some patients felt hopeless at the onset of the pandemic. “They said: I’m going to just eat whatever because I don’t know what’s happening,” she said. “And a lot of patients also started to drink more than they had been before due to the uncertainty. As things got better, they came back and said, ‘Wow, during COVID I put on 20, 30, 40 pounds.”
There are several benefits to physical health associated with maintaining a healthy weight, but there are also mental, emotional, and social benefits to postmenopausal weight loss. Understanding a patient’s motivations behind their diet and exercise habits is key to weight management, according to Dr Willenbrock. She emphasized the importance of taking a non-judgmental approach to asking questions to determine why a patient has established certain behaviors and working together to make changes.
It is important to discuss women’s feelings about food and what may trigger stress eating, cravings, and decrease motivation. “I’ve talked to women and I found out that they have PTSD; where they have experienced abuse in their past and they were eating because of all of those undiscussed emotions and feelings, which was eye-opening for them,” Dr Willenbrock said.
The ability to get back to the activities they once enjoyed is one of the most empowering aspects of postmenopausal weight loss, Dr Willenbrock explained. Prioritizing time for activities that reduce stress and strengthen social connections can facilitate postmenopausal weight loss.
“I really try to empower patients to do what’s best for them; what’s going to make them feel good?” Dr Willenbrock said. I say to everybody: look for social activities. Check your local AARP or libraryThere are discounts and there are all kinds of little social things they can get you to do or volunteer to do something.”
For patients who are trying to lose weight, checking the scale regularly can be disheartening; furthermore it does not provide a complete picture. That is why Dr Willenbrock does not rely on body mass index (BMI) to track her patients’ weight loss. Instead, she uses waist measurements, which are especially helpful in postmenopausal women who typically gain weight in the abdominal area, to track weight loss and encourage her patients to keep making progress.
“That’s more empowering,” Dr Willenbrock said. “I’m like, you could get on the scale, but you’re going to see on the scale that it’s going to fluctuate.”
Surgery and weight loss medications are also effective options for treating the disease of obesity; however, Dr Willenbrock stated that there is still a role for nutritional and behavioral changes to play in helping postmenopausal women manage weight gain amid rising popularity of medication and bariatric surgery.",Nikki Kean; Michelle Falci
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/endometriosis-pain-leads-to-missed-school-work/,Endometriosis Pain Leads to Missed School and Work in Two-Thirds of Women,"More than two-thirds of women with endometriosis missed school or work due to pain from the condition, in a study of more than 17,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44 in the US. That is a key finding of new research published in the Journal of Endometriosis and Uterine Disorders.
Our study also found that Black and Hispanic women were less likely to be diagnosed with endometriosis compared with white women. Interestingly, women who identified as part of the LGBTQ community had a higher likelihood of receiving an endometriosis diagnosis than heterosexual women.
We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which is administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the period 2011 to 2019. The survey data use adjusted weights to account for the racial composition of US society, meaning our sample of 17,619 women represents 51,981,323 women of the US population.
We specifically examined factors related to quality of life, such as poverty, education and functional impairment, as well as race and sexual orientation.
I am a physician-scientist and a researcher in women’s health, working together with specialists in OB-GYN from Yale and the University of Texas.
Endometriosis is a chronic, often painful condition that affects approximately 10% of reproductive-age women worldwide. It occurs when tissues that would normally line the inner surface of the uterus instead occur outside the uterus, such as on the ovaries or even in distant organs such as the lungs or brain. These abnormally located lesions respond to hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle, causing pain when stimulated by the hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle.
Our study sheds light on how endometriosis, despite its prevalence, remains underdiagnosed and underresearched. We found that 6.4% of reproductive-age women in the US had an endometriosis diagnosis. More than 67% reported missed work or school, or having been unable to perform daily activities, due to pain associated with endometriosis.
Our study highlights disparities in the diagnosis and management of endometriosis among different racial groups. Black women had 63% lower odds of getting an endometriosis diagnosis, and Hispanic women had 55% lower odds compared with non-Hispanic white women. This disparity may reflect historical biases in health care, pointing to the need for more equitable practices.
In addition, our study underscores the importance of considering women’s health across diverse population subgroups, with particular attention to sexual orientation. We found that non-heterosexual lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer women had 54% higher odds of receiving an endometriosis diagnosis compared with straight women. Our study was the first to examine endometriosis likelihood among non-heterosexual women at the national level in the US.
We found no significant association between endometriosis and other quality-of-life indicators such as poverty, education or employment status, which suggests that the condition affects women across various socioeconomic backgrounds.
Our work adds to the growing body of evidence that Black women are less likely to be diagnosed with endometriosis and that their reported pain symptoms are often overlooked.
Explanations for this inequity include health care bias against minority women and limited access to medical care among Black women. Research also shows that many medical professionals as well as medical students and residents believe that Black women have a lower pain threshold compared with the white population.
This is another possible reason that pain symptoms among Black women with endometriosis get neglected. Researchers from the UK reported the same findings, attributing these disparities to systemic bias and inequitable medical care.
Another study estimates that the lifetime costs associated with having endometriosis are about US $27,855 per year per patient in the US, costing the country about $22 billion annually on health care expenditures.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/blood-sugar-fluctuations-anxiety-and-depression/,Blood Sugar Fluctuations After Eating Play a Role in Anxiety and Depression,"The Conversation — The proverbial “sugar high” that follows the ingestion of a sweet treat is a familiar example of the potentially positive effects of food on mood.
On the flip side, feeling “hangry” – the phenomenon where hunger manifests in the form of anger or irritability – illustrates how what we eat, or don’t eat, can also provoke negative emotions.
The latest research suggests that blood sugar fluctuations are partly responsible for the connection between what we eat and how we feel. Through its effects on our hormones and our nervous system, blood sugar levels can be fuel for anxiety and depression.
Mental health is complex. There are countless social, psychological and biological factors that ultimately determine any one person’s experience. However, numerous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that diet is one biological factor that can significantly influence risk for symptoms of depression and anxiety, especially in women.
As a family medicine resident with a PhD in nutrition, I have witnessed the fact that antidepressant medications work for some patients but not others. Thus, in my view, mental health treatment strategies should target every risk factor, including nutrition.
Many of the randomized controlled trials that have proven the link between diet and mental health have tested the Mediterranean diet or a slightly modified version of it. The Mediterranean diet is typically characterized by lots of vegetables – especially dark green, leafy vegetables – fruit, olive oil, whole grains, legumes and nuts, with small amounts of fish, meat, and dairy products. One of the many attributes of the Mediterranean diet that may be responsible for its effect on mood is its low glycemic index.
The glycemic index is a system that ranks foods and diets according to their potential to raise blood sugar. Thus, in keeping with the observation that blood sugar fluctuations affect mood, high glycemic index diets that produce drastic spikes in blood sugar have been associated with increased risk for depression and to some extent anxiety.
High glycemic index carbohydrates include white rice, white bread, crackers and baked goods. Therefore, diets high in these foods may increase risk for depression and anxiety. Meanwhile, low glycemic index carbs, such as parboiled rice and al dente pasta, that are more slowly absorbed and produce a smaller blood sugar spike are associated with decreased risk.
Many scientific mechanisms have been proposed to explain the connection between diet and mental health. One plausible explanation that links blood sugar fluctuations with mood is its effect on our hormones.
Every time we eat sugar or carbohydrates such as bread, rice, pasta, potatoes and crackers, the resulting rise in blood sugar triggers a cascade of hormones and signaling molecules. One example, dopamine – our brain’s pleasure signal – is the reason we can experience a “sugar high” following the consumption of dessert or baked goods. Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding us for procuring the calories, or energy, that are necessary for survival.
Insulin is another hormone triggered by carbohydrates and sugar. Insulin’s job is to lower blood sugar levels by escorting the ingested sugar into our cells and tissues so that it can be used for energy. However, when we eat too much sugar, too many carbs, or high glycemic index carbs, the rapid increase in blood sugar prompts a drastic rise in insulin. This can result in blood sugar levels that dip below where they started.
This dip in blood sugar sparks the release of adrenaline and its cousin noradrenaline. Both of these hormones appropriately send glucose into the bloodstream to restore blood sugar to the appropriate level.
However, adrenaline influences more than just blood sugar levels. It also affects how we feel, and its release can manifest as anxiety, fear or aggression. Hence, diet affects mood through its effect on blood sugar levels, which trigger the hormones that dictate how we feel.
Interestingly, the rise in adrenaline that follows sugar and carbohydrate consumption doesn’t happen until 4 to five hours after eating. Thus, when eating sugar and carbs, dopamine makes us feel good in the short term; but in the long term, adrenaline can make us feel bad.
However, not everyone is equally affected. Identical meals can produce widely varying blood sugar responses in different people, depending on one’s sex, as well as genetics, sedentariness and the gut microbiome.
And it’s important to keep in mind that, as previously mentioned, mental health is complicated. So in certain circumstances, no amount of dietary optimization will overcome the social and psychological factors that may underpin one’s experience.
Nevertheless, a poor diet could certainly make a person’s experience worse and is thus relevant for anyone, especially women, hoping to optimize mental health. Research has shown that women, in particular, are more sensitive to the effects of the glycemic index and diet overall.
Unfortunately, simple solutions, such as swapping sugar for artificial sweeteners, are not an option. Research has shown that among all processed foods, artificial sweeteners and artificially sweetened beverages are most strongly associated with depression.
The most obvious way to stabilize blood sugar levels is to decrease sugar and carbohydrate intake. However, this is not the only way. Research has proven that simple changes can drastically mitigate volatile blood sugar fluctuations. Some strategies to stabilize blood sugar and optimize mood include:

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/nodule-on-the-lower-back/,Dermatologic Clinic: Nodule on the Lower Back,"A 58-year-old Black man with hypertension and diabetes mellitus presents to the clinic with a growing, solitary nodule on his lower back that has been present for the past year. He lives alone and mentions that it is difficult for him to see this area of his body, but he believes the lesion has been steadily increasing in size. The nodule occasionally causes sharp, shooting pain, and is pruritic, although it does not exhibit any drainage. On physical examination, the nodule is very firm, with small white papules present within the hyperpigmented lesion.
Granular cell tumors were first described by Abrikossoff in 1926, who believed they originated from muscle tissue and thus coined the term “granular cell myoblastoma” to describe these lesions.1 However, in 1935, Feyrter suggested a neural origin for these tumors, which are now believed to originate from Schwann cells.2
Regarding the epidemiology of granular cell tumors, they occur predominantly in adults, with a predilection for Black patients and women. These rare tumors account for about 0.5% of soft tissue tumors.3 They are most often located in the oral mucosa, specifically the tongue (25%), and about 70% of cases are found in the head and neck region. Less commonly, they may be located in the breast, proximal extremities, or visceral organs such as the respiratory or digestive tracts. Although rare, multiple granular cell tumors can occur in the context of certain genetic conditions.
As noted, granular cell tumors are thought to arise from Schwann cells, a type of neural origin.2 They express neural markers such as S100, SOX10, and CD57. Loss of function mutations in V-ATPase accessory genes (ATP6AP1 or ATP6AP2) leads to inactivation of membrane protein pumps, resulting in downstream accumulation of lysosomes and tumorigenesis.4 In a group of genetic conditions called RASopathies, including Noonan syndrome and LEOPARD syndrome (lentigines, electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonic stenosis, abnormal genitalia, growth retardation, and sensorineural deafness), patients may present with multiple granular cell tumors, suggesting that the RAS-MAP kinase pathway may also contribute to the formation of these tumors.1
Risk factors for granular cell tumors are limited due to the rarity of the condition, but they are more commonly associated with females, Black individuals, adults between the ages of 40 and 60, and certain genetic conditions such as Noonan syndrome, LEOPARD syndrome, and Carney complex.
Clinically, granular cell tumors tend to present as slow-growing, painless, firm papules, nodules, or circular plaques. They can be dark brown or flesh-toned and tend to grow insidiously. The typical size ranges from 0.5 cm to 3 cm. Occasionally, the surface becomes ulcerated or verrucous. Upon palpation, the tumor has well-defined borders and is mobile.
On dermatoscope inspection, oral granular cell tumors can display yellowish to white structureless areas with polymorphic vessels.5
Histologically, granular cell tumors are ill-defined and composed of polygonal, epithelioid cells with a granular appearance due to the accumulation of lysosomal granules. These polygonal cells may stain pale and sometimes invade the subcutaneous tissue. Large granules with clear halos, called pustulo-ovoid bodies of Milian, can be observed. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia may also be present, sometimes mimicking squamous cell carcinoma histologically. Granular cell tumors are PAS-positive and diastase-resistant. Malignant transformation is rare, occurring in only 1% to 2% of cases, typically in tumors that invade deeply.3
The differential diagnosis for a granular cell tumor is broad, highlighting the importance of a skin biopsy for definitive diagnosis. Other entities to consider include squamous cell carcinoma, adnexal neoplasm, dermatofibroma, lipoma, schwannoma, neurofibroma, and leiomyoma. If the lesion is in the oral mucosa, the differential diagnosis also includes irritation fibroma and verruca.
A skin biopsy is essential for diagnosis, as histopathology reveals the characteristic granular-appearing polygonal cells. A punch biopsy is generally preferred over a shave biopsy for diagnosing granular cell tumors. A shave biopsy, if performed too superficially, may sample only the overlying pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, leading to a mistaken diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. Staining for S100, SOX10, PGP9.5 (neuron-specific peptide), CD57, and nerve growth factor receptor will be positive, aiding in diagnosis.
Granular cell tumors are best treated with surgical excision with clear margins. Even with clear margins, a recurrence risk of 2% to 8% has been reported.6 Complete excision is recommended, as incomplete removal leads to a high rate of recurrence. Benign granular cell tumors have an excellent prognosis with complete surgical excision.
The patient was referred to surgical oncology for complete wide local excision with margins.","Lana Dokic, BSA; Yelena Dokic, MD"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/surgical-site-infection-prevention/,Surgical Site Infection Prevention: A Guideline From the ASCRS,"The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) has issued a clinical practice guideline (CPG) on preventing surgical site infections (SSI). The new guidance was published in Diseases of the Colon & Rectum.
The CPG summarizes the available evidence on SSI prevention in colorectal operation and is the first in-depth ASCRS guideline to address the topic. It is intended for all practitioners, health care workers, and patients involved in the management of SSIs.
The ASCRS developed 18 recommendations regarding institutional interventions, preoperative interventions, intraoperative interventions, and wound care. The recommendations were based on a final review of 139 studies.
The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology was used to determine the final grade of recommendation and level of evidence for each statement. The evidence was graded as high, moderate, low, or very low, and the recommendations were rated as strong or conditional.
The CPG defined an SSI as an infection of the incision (superficial SSI), tissue below the incision (deep SSI), or within the abdominal cavity (organ space SSI).
In its first recommendation, the ASCRS committee states that implementing an SSI bundle for patients who are having a colorectal operation may reduce the incidence of SSIs (strong based on moderate-quality evidence). Research has shown that care bundles are effective for decreasing SSIs and during emergency colorectal operation, and SSI bundles may be enhanced with an enhanced recovery protocol. Bundles with more components have been found to have a greater effect in reducing overall SSI rates. Bundles that included sterile closure trays, mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) with oral antibiotics, and preclosure glove changes have been shown to have the most benefit.
Oral antibiotics combined with MBP can decrease the incidence of SSIs after elective colorectal resection (strong based on moderate-quality evidence), according to the guideline. For cases in which MBP is contraindicated or omitted, preoperative oral antibiotic preparation alone can lower the incidence of SSIs (conditional based on moderate-quality evidence). Research has shown that MBP alone is not associated with SSI reduction, and multiple studies have found that adding oral antibiotics to an MBP can reduce SSI incidence. In addition, meta-analyses have found reduced SSI rates with oral antibiotics alone vs no bowel prep.
According to the CPG, showering with chlorhexidine before a colorectal operation does not have a significant effect on SSI rates (strong based on moderate-quality evidence), and smoking cessation before an operation may lower the risk for SSIs (conditional based on moderate-quality evidence). Investigators have found that chlorhexidine gluconate provides no benefit compared with plain soap, and it may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions. Other evidence has shown that current smokers have a significantly higher risk for SSIs vs patients who never smoked, and smoking cessation significantly decreased the overall SSI incidence.
The guideline recommends that on the day of colorectal operation, patients are advised to have their hair removed from the surgical site using a clipper or not have it removed at all, and that using a razor before operation is not advised (strong based on moderate-quality evidence). “Hair removal may be necessary to facilitate preoperative skin marking, adequate exposure, and application of wound dressings and stoma appliances,” the committee noted.
The guideline recommends that patients undergoing colorectal resection take parenteral antibiotics within 60 minutes of incision, with dosing and redosing based on the antibiotic’s pharmacokinetic profile (strong based on low-quality evidence). The timing of antibiotic administration regarding incision has been controversial, according to the committee. “The majority of existing guidelines and literature support dosing within 60 to 120 minutes before incision,” guideline authors wrote. “Several studies have demonstrated mixed results regarding whether a tighter window (within 30 minutes) of administration relative to incision would be beneficial.” In addition, a longer operation duration is an independent risk factor for SSIs, and research has suggested that antimicrobial redosing should be considered when the procedure is longer than 2 half-lives of the antimicrobial agent.
The CPG recommends that individuals with a penicillin allergy may be assessed for true hypersensitivity and high-risk reactions to penicillin, and delabeling a patient who is penicillin-allergic may be beneficial for the appropriate use of a preoperative prophylactic beta-lactam antibiotic and improve outcomes (conditional based on low-quality evidence). The guideline also states that prophylactic parenteral antibiotics be limited to the first 24 hours postoperatively in a majority of clean and clean-contaminated cases (strong based on moderate-quality evidence). Some studies have found no differences in SSI rates for surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis of 24 hours vs more than 24 hours in patients who are having a colorectal operation.
The guideline recommends cleansing the surgical site with a chlorhexidine alcohol–based preparation in patients undergoing colorectal operation (strong based on moderate-quality evidence). Some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating multiple surgical procedures reported significant benefit with use of chlorhexidine alcohol–based solutions vs aqueous povidone-iodine in decreasing SSI rates.
Hyperglycemia on the day of operation and during the immediate postoperative period can increase SSI risk after elective colorectal resection (conditional based on moderate-quality evidence), and maintaining intraoperative normothermia may lower SSI incidence in patients having colorectal operation (conditional based on low-quality evidence), according to the guideline. Some research has shown that maintaining normothermia during open colorectal operation resulted in a significant decrease in overall SSI rates, although other studies did not find an independent association between hypothermia and SSI. In 2016, the American College of Surgeons and Surgical Infection Society recommended intraoperative maintenance of normothermia to lower the risk for SSIs.
High-fractionated oxygen (FIO2) is generally not recommended for preventing SSIs (conditional based on moderate-quality evidence). The routine use of perioperative hyperoxia is not advised owing to mixed results in the literature, the guideline authors noted.
A strong recommendation was given for the use of wound protectors to decrease the incidence of SSIs after colorectal operation (strong based on high-quality evidence). Investigators have reported that a wound protector was associated with a significant decrease in SSI among patients undergoing abdominal operation. Other research found that double-ring devices had an increased protective effect compared with single-ring devices. In addition, impervious plastic wound protector use may be beneficial in patients undergoing abdominal operation.
Another strong recommendation was provided for the use of minimally invasive colorectal operation to decrease the incidence of SSIs vs open operation (strong based on high-quality evidence). RCTs have found that SSI rates were significantly reduced after laparoscopic colorectal operation compared with open operation.
The use of topical antimicrobial agents applied to the surgical incision is not recommended, according to the guideline (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence). The committee noted that high-quality evidence is lacking on the use of topical antimicrobials after the closure of incisions in colorectal operation. Some research on the use of locally applied gentamicin for incision closure after colorectal operation found no significant difference in overall SSI rates, and other research comparing no sponge, collagen sponge, and gentamicin-containing collagen sponge in patients undergoing colorectal operation found no significant difference in SSI rates among the groups.
A conditional recommendation was made for the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in patients with primarily closed incisions for reducing the incidence of SSIs (conditional recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence). NPWT may improve wound healing by promoting angiogenesis and reducing edema, although whether it affects SSI rates is uncertain, the committee noted. Some researchers reported no statistically significant difference in SSI rate for NPWT vs standard gauze dressing in colorectal resections. However, other research on NPWT after abdominal operations found a decrease in SSI rate associated with NPWT.
In its final recommendation, the guideline states that advanced silver or antimicrobial dressings are not routinely recommended in cases of clean or clean-contaminated wounds after colorectal operation (conditional recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence). Some investigators found that silver-impregnated dressings did not decrease the incidence of SSI in patients undergoing cardiac operation compared with gauze. Use of mupirocin gauze has yielded mixed results in several RCTs for preventing SSIs in colorectal-specific patients.
“These guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care nor exclusive of methods of care reasonably directed toward obtaining the same results,” the guideline authors wrote. “The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure must be made by the physician in light of all the circumstances presented by the individual patient.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/hematopoietic-cell-transplant-hct/,Hematopoietic Cell Transplant: Review for Primary Care Providers,"Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is a potentially curative treatment for hematologic malignancies, autoimmune disorders, and blood dyscrasias.1  Hematopoietic stem cells can be collected from and administered to the same patient, known as autologous HCT, or collected from a donor and administered to a patient, known as allogeneic HCT. Both approaches use cells harvested from the peripheral blood, bone marrow, or umbilical cord blood.
The goal of HCT is to cure an underlying malignancy or hematologic disorder.2 The procedure can be performed in an inpatient or outpatient setting. Each setting is associated with its own risks and benefits.1 Inpatient HCT is associated with higher risks for nosocomial infections, such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections, whereas outpatient HCT is associated with a greater risk for graft vs. host disease, as well as an increased likelihood of readmission.1 Prognosis after HCT is dependent on the original diagnosis, comorbidities, risk factors, and complications.
The treatment of hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma, acute myeloblastic leukemia, chronic myeloblastic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is the most common indication for HCT.2,3 Autologous HCT is considered first-line therapy for multiple myeloma and aggressive lymphomas, whereas allogeneic HCT is best used for high-risk leukemia patients.4 The procedure can be used in the treatment of refractory autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, systemic sclerosis, and Crohn disease.2,5Finally, HCT has been used in the treatment of aplastic anemia and transfusion-dependent thalassemia.3
Before starting the process of HCT,2,5 every patient must be screened to assess their eligibility. Not only does the patient’s diagnosis contribute to the plan for treatment but comorbidities, functional status, psychosocial well-being, and the presence of a support system also must be assessed.6 This can be done using the Transplant Evaluation Rating Scale (TERS). The TERS, which has been shown to predict post-transplant outcomes after 1 year, assesses 10 areas of psychosocial functioning and allows administering practitioners to rate each area according to the patient’s level of impairment (Table 1).7-9 In each section, a score of 1 indicates minimal impairment while a score of 3 indicates severe impairment, with overall scores ranging from 26.5 to 79.5 points.7 If patients score higher on the TERS, it is understood that they have higher levels of psychosocial impairment and have an increased likelihood of mortality from a transplant, which may make them ineligible for HCT.7
A study conducted on patients who underwent allogeneic HCT from 2003 to 2017 showed significantly longer overall survival, disease-free survival, and lower rates of nonrelapse mortality for patient’s considered low risk on the TERS evaluation compared with patients considered intermediate or high risk.8 These results support the use of a tool such as the TERS for evaluation of transplant eligibility, showing that psychosocial factors significantly affect long-term morbidity and mortality.7-9
In addition to a lower TERS score, patients must have a reliable caregiver for the first 90 days after transplantation to be considered eligible for HCT.6 After a patient is determined to be eligible, the process of HCT can begin.
In both types of HCT, stem cells can be harvested from the peripheral blood, bone marrow, or umbilical cord blood.2 Peripheral blood collection is done by a process called apheresis, in which blood is separated into its components, allowing the desired component to be collected and the remainder to be returned to the patient. Peripheral blood collection, which has become the preferred source of hematopoietic cells, results in shorter hospitalizations and faster engraftment of cells into the recipient’s bone marrow compared with collection of stem cells from bone marrow.2,10
Although it is more common for hematopoietic stem cells to be harvested from the bone marrow or peripheral blood, stem cells from umbilical cord blood have the advantage of being rapidly available.11 Umbilical cord blood also is associated with decreased rates of chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) and low rates of relapse compared with other methods of HCT collection.11 Although public health concerns have been raised, the collection of umbilical cord blood poses no harm to the mother or the newborn because the blood is collected after the cord has been separated from the newborn, and it can be used for the same indications as hematopoietic stem cells collected by other means.11
For a patient to undergo allogeneic HCT, they must first match with a hematopoietic cell donor. Both the recipient and donor must undergo human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing and matching to ensure that the graft will not begin attacking the recipient’s native cells after engraftment. HLA typing and matching, one of the strongest determinants of success in HCT,5 can be performed using cell-based crossmatching.12 Approximately 30% of recipients have a greater chance of matching with related donors, but unrelated donors are also an option for patients who are unable to find a related donor match.5
As little as 16% of patients from racial and ethnic minorities are likely to match with a potential donor.12 In these instances, related donors with partial HLA matches, also referred to as haploidentical donors, can be used, with high-dose cyclophosphamide administered to recipients after transplantation.3,12 The use of haploidentical donors has broadened the population of patients eligible to receive HCT without a perfectly HLA-matched donor and has made it possible for patients to receive allogeneic HCT urgently.3 Unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation also is an option in these instances and is available rapidly for those in need of urgent transplantation.11
Before a patient can receive a transplant of stem cells, they must undergo a conditioning regimen to prepare the bone marrow for the engraftment of healthy cells. The goal of the conditioning regimen is to destroy the patient’s own cells and adequately suppress the patient’s immune system. Ablating a patient’s bone marrow of dysfunctional or malignant cells increases the likelihood of disease remission. The immunosuppression reduces the chance for rejection of the HCT and increases the likelihood that the healthy transplanted cells will restore the bone marrow.
The conditioning regimen is typically chemotherapy or radiotherapy and falls into 1 of 3 categories:
Conditioning regimen intensity and methods are chosen on a case-by-case basis. Factors such as the patient’s diagnosis, remission status, presence of comorbid conditions, age, and whether the patient is undergoing allogeneic or autologous HCT influence the conditioning regimen chosen.
The main difference between allogeneic and autologous HCT is the source of the stem cells. In both allogeneic and autologous HCT, patients undergo a conditioning treatment.5 After the conditioning treatment is over, a patient will receive hematopoietic stem cells via an infusion to encourage the growth of healthy cells in the bone marrow.2 The transplantation typically occurs via a central catheter and can take place in an inpatient or outpatient setting.2 To ensure successful engraftment of cells into the bone marrow, complete blood counts are monitored for 3 days after the transplant to ensure that the counts trend upward.2
Complications of HCT are divided into 3 categories based on when they occur (Table 2).2,13-23 The first category of complication occurs in the pre-engraftment period, which begins with the conditioning regimen and ends when the neutrophils have returned to normal levels in the recipient.2,13-18 Typically, the conditioning regimen induces a state of neutropenia in the patient, which places the patient at a higher risk for opportunistic infections.2 The conditioning regimen also can cause gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and organ dysfunction.2
The second category of complications occurs during the post-engraftment period, which starts once a patient’s neutrophil count has normalized and extends to 100 days after the HCT.2 In this period, the risk for opportunistic infection remains while the immune system continues to strengthen.13,19-21
The third category of complications occurs during the late post-engraftment period, which begins 100 days after HCT and continues indefinitely. The complications vary from inflammatory disease processes such as chronic GVHD to long-term complications such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.2,20,21 These long-term complications, which are thought to be due to the conditioning regimen, can include damage to a patient’s neurohormonal system, vascular endothelium, and immune system, which, in turn, can cause complications such as metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.22
One of the biggest complications of allogeneic HCT that can occur in the post-engraftment or late post-engraftment period is GVHD, a systemic disease process that occurs when the recipient’s cells are attacked by the donor’s transplanted hematopoietic stem cells.19 After transplantation of the stem cells, the tissue antigens of the recipient are expressed to the T-cells of the donor. The T-cells from the donor recognize the recipient’s cells as foreign and begin to mount an immune response against them, resulting in an inflammatory cytokine reaction.19 This systemic reaction can occur due to an HLA or sex mismatch between the donor and the recipient. High-intensity conditioning regimens and ineffective prophylaxis against GVHD also can result in GVHD.19
Acute GVHD occurs within 100 days of transplant, whereas chronic GVHD can occur any time after 100 days posttransplant.19 Despite the use of cyclosporine and methotrexate as prophylaxis for GVHD, the incidence of GVHD after allogeneic HCT is between 30% and 50%, and greater than 10% of patients die from this complication.19,20
Typically, GVHD manifests as a maculopapular skin reaction occurring on the palms, soles, and neck.20 The disease can manifest as GI irritation, such as diarrhea or nausea/vomiting, and can affect solid organs such as the liver, causing abnormalities in liver function or jaundice.20,21 The diagnosis of GVHD is usually a clinical one if the patient meets the criteria of having immunologically competent cells from the donor, tissue antigens that are not expressed in the donor cells, and the inability to mount an immune response to eliminate the donor cells.19 The treatment consists of high-dose corticosteroids, but over 50% of patients will require additional therapies, such as ibrutinib, extracorporeal photopheresis, and ruxolitinib.2,21
Prognosis after HCT varies depending on a patient’s diagnosis, comorbidities, and risk factors. Generally, a patient’s neutrophil count recovers 2 to 3 weeks after HCT.13 Other, more specialized cells, such as natural killer cells, B-cells, CD8 cells, and CD4 cells take anywhere between 3 months and 2 years to return to normal levels.13
Autologous HCT has been shown to better prevent relapse of disease compared with allogeneic HCT.23 Mortality in autologous HCT has been shown to occur in less than 1% of patients, whereas allogeneic HCT carries a higher rate of mortality, with over 30% of patients dying within 1-year after transplantation.5,23
Primary care provider familiarity with the steps involved in HCT will enhance quality of life and improve morbidity and mortality for patients by identifying and educating appropriate donors and recipients. The field of HCT has advanced with new medications and technology and offers a curative treatment for patients with hematologic malignancies, autoimmune disorders, and blood dyscrasias globally. With continued advances, this approach may be able to offer a larger population of patients with rarer diseases the hope of a cure.","Heather Adams, MPAS, PA-C; Julia Danko, MPAS, PA-C"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/school-avoidance/,"Managing School Avoidance and Refusal in Children, Adolescents Post-Pandemic","The rates and severity of school avoidance has skyrocketed after the COVID-19 pandemic. In the school year before the pandemic, 14% of students were at high risk of school avoidance and 14% were at extreme risk. In the 2021-22 school year, 22% of students were at high risk and 43% were at extreme risk.
“Even though we know the numbers have gone up, the severity of school avoidance is much worse now since COVID,” said Lisa Beauvois, FNP, PMHNP, a nurse practitioner (NP) at Johns Hopkins Pediatric Psychiatry.
“School avoidance is associated with anxiety in about 80% of the cases,” Ms Beauvois told The Clinical Advisor. “We’ve seen a large increase in anxiety since COVID. This is especially true in children with baseline anxiety who got a year off from having to be in social situations and confronting their anxiety on a daily basis. Having to go back to school is a big leap for a child who has had a year off without social interaction. Managing anxiety is based on frequent exposure to what is causing the discomfort. Without being in situations where they can experience success in school, the child begins to imagine the worst and becomes overwhelmed by worries about ‘what if’.”
School avoidance affects many aspects of a child’s life including self-esteem, academic success, social skills, and family relationships. While often associated with anxiety, school avoidance is not a medical diagnosis. The onset of school avoidance is gradual in nature, with most children missing 10% of days (18 days in a typical school year). Children may attend part of the school day or spend most of the day outside the class in the nurse’s office or with the guidance counselor, for example. Somatic complaints are common.
School refusal involves children who are more likely to be defiant, but school refusal can still be anxiety-driven. These children refuse to attend any part of the school day, and this can progress to chronic absenteeism. Students often have academic trouble and/or failure, and their relationships with parents or guardians become strained by increasing conflicts.
Fear is often a driving force in school avoidance. The child may fear what will happen at home or harm befalling their parent while they are apart. They may have experienced bullying or harassment, fear school-based violence, or had a teacher conflict at school. Children may be avoiding situations that lead to discomfort, such as taking a test, oral presentations, and social situations.  In some cases, the child may feel an overall sense of danger around attending school.
School avoidance/refusal may begin with a medical illness. The child may have missed school during the illness and now become anxious about falling behind, leading to school avoidance.
“What school avoidance looks like in terms of behaviors that kids exhibit,” Ms Beauvois said, “is social withdrawal, somatic complaints and acting out, sometimes aggressively. Their emotions become so overwhelming, and they feel stressed about having to confront those anxieties, they act out. These are not typically aggressive kids, but they can look like and act very dysregulated when they’re pushed into a corner and forced to go to school.”
Symptoms and behaviors of school avoidance and refusal vary by child (Table 1).
It is possible to recognize signs of school avoidance in children aged less than 5 years. These children may show signs of separation anxiety, have difficulty sleeping through the night, or not communicate verbally due to selective mutism.
“Parents will tell me it is really hard to drop these kids off at school,” Ms Beauvois said. “They’ll cry for hours until their parents come back. They’re not really able to say that they’re anxious, but they are exhibiting a lot of symptoms that look like anxiety.”
Primary care NPs are in a unique place to recognize signs of school avoidance and refusal when parents may bring their child with somatic complaints in for a visit. A child who presents with symptoms such as gastrointestinal disturbances, headaches, and shortness of breath that do not have another explanation may need to be screened for school avoidance or refusal.
There are 2 tools that can be used to screen children who show signs of school avoidance or refusal (Table 2).
The revised School Refusal Assessment Scale (ScARED), developed by Christopher Kearney, is based on 4 profiles. The first is “avoidance of stimuli provoking negative affectivity,” the second is “escape from aversive social and/or evaluative situations,” the third is “attention seeking,” and the fourth is “tangible rewards.”
When screening children for school avoidance and refusal, it is important to note that there are disparities in the prevalence of school avoidance and refusal between racial and ethnic groups.
“School avoidance is higher in non-White children and families,” Ms Beauvois said. “Those children are also at higher risk for academic challenges when economic challenges exist. If they are starting off behind economically and academically, and now to have another delay it makes school avoidance particularly tricky to treat. I think we’re going to see ongoing fallout from this in the future.”
For children who experience school avoidance/refusal due to an anxiety disorder, the “gold standard” treatment plan is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), followed by medication if necessary.
Psychotherapy, specifically CBT or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), can be helpful for managing avoidance. By focusing on helping children accept what they cannot change and take control of what they can change, ACT can be beneficial for older children.
Family support and creative solutions should complement psychotherapy. Getting the child out of the home and having them participate in sports or recreational activities with their peers can be helpful; these activities should take into consideration the childs’ likes, dislikes, and motivations.
School involvement is also helpful in managing anxiety-driven school avoidance. Schools can partner with families by having the child attend school with a modified schedule, having the student meet their teacher outside of school before the first day, or assisting with the child’s involvement in extracurricular activities.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) may be appropriate for a child with impairing anxiety whose school avoidance and anxiety symptoms are not well-controlled with CBT.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved duloxetine in 2014  and escitalopram in 2023 for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in children aged 7 -17 years of age. Fluvoxamine is FDA-approved for managing OCD in children and adolescents aged 8 to 17 years.  Fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine are often used off-label to manage impairing anxiety in children experiencing school avoidance or refusal.
In cases of opposition and truancy, more advanced care may be necessary. The Department of Social Services, Family Preservation Unit,  may need to be engaged to support the family, and the child or adolescent may benefit from specialized care at a hospital or residential program.
In the years following the COVID-19 pandemic, parents, educators, and health care professionals are faced with the same issue: higher-than-ever rates of school avoidance and refusal.
For some students, remote education during lockdowns provided a way to feel in control, and being back in an unpredictable school environment is challenging. For others, decreases in socialization and time with peers exacerbated their anxiety symptoms.
Even before the pandemic, bullying often played a role in a child or adolescent refusing to attend school. Ms Beauvois also noted that increased social media interactions can put students at risk for experiencing cyberbullying.
While it can be challenging emotionally for parents to have a child with school avoidance or refusal, Ms Beauvois explained that approaching the situation with persistence is key to making progress.
“I feel like this is one of the most difficult anxiety disorders to manage from a caregiver perspective. Parents and caregivers are having to set a limit and they’re seeing their child really distressed,” Ms Beauvois said. “They’re seeing them cry and really come apart, which is upsetting. It’s something that the parent knows is the right thing for the child, but they have to witness this real distress before the child gets better. And with treatment they do get better, it gets a little bit easier, but it requires a constant push by the parent.”",Michelle Falci; Nikki Kean
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/2024-gold-copd-report-reflects-shift-in-thinking-on-copd-management/,2024 GOLD Report Reflects New Research and Thinking on COPD Management,"The 2024 GOLD Report, “Global Strategy for Prevention Diagnosis and Management of COPD,” not only includes guideline updates that reflect the latest research on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); it also reflects some shifts in thinking about what’s important in COPD treatment, according to Claus Vogelmeier, MD, a lead report author and science committee chair for the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), which just released its 6th major update of the report.
Vogelmeier, who heads the Department of Medicine, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at the University Medical Center of the Philipps-University of Marburg, Germany, summarized key changes in the 2024 GOLD COPD guidelines for clinicians at the 2023 GOLD COPD International Conference in Philadelphia on November 14.
These changes include:
Although many changes in the 2024 report reflect new research released from January 2022 to July 2023 (148 new references in total), the updated report does more than just incorporate this new research, said Dr Vogelmeier.
The new “consolidated” report continues to refine the definition of COPD and pre-COPD, he noted, saying that report authors “have been discussing intensely how to define COPD,” including whether the definition should be spirometry-based. Other topics actively discussed by the GOLD science committee members who authored the report were when to do post-bronchodilator spirometry, reducing the carbon footprint of inhalers, COPD-asthma overlap, and the non-use of biologics for COPD.
Hyperinflation warranted a new section in the 2024 report because committee members saw it as an “underrated” condition, said Dr Vogelmeier. “Right now, we don’t really know how to address hyperinflation, but overall we think it’s a very important topic,” he explained.
The 2024 GOLD report reflects a sea change in thinking about smoking cessation. Vaping, which may in itself lead to long-term respiratory issues, is discouraged as a smoking cessation tool. Instead, the report puts new focus on the use of pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation, said Dr Vogelmeier.
A diagnosis of COPD is confirmed with the presence of nonfully reversible airflow obstruction (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]/forced vital capacity [FVC] <0.7 postbronchodilation) measured by spirometry. Symptoms generally include dyspnea, wheezing, chest tightness, fatigue, activity limitation, and/or cough with or without sputum production.
Patients considered as having pre-COPD or PRISm have a risk for developing airflow obstruction over time. Pre-COPD was recently proposed to include individuals of any age with respiratory symptoms and/or other detectable structural and/or functional abnormalities, without airflow obstruction on forced spirometry. The report authors noted that randomized controlled trials are needed in patients with pre-COPD and young patients with COPD.
PRISm refers to patients with preserved ratio (FEV1/FVC ≥0.7 after bronchodilation) but impaired spirometry (FEV1 <80% of reference after bronchodilation). PRISm is increased among those who currently smoke and formerly smoked and is associated with high and low body mass index, female sex, obesity, and multimorbidity, and it also may lead to a greater risk for cardiopulmonary disease, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization, and airway obstruction.
Up to about one-third of patients with PRISm may transition to having obstructed spirometry, with predictors such as lower baseline FEV1%, increased age, and current smoking status. Overall, the pathogenesis and treatment of PRISm have significant knowledge gaps, according to the committee.
“Not all individuals with pre-COPD or PRISm will eventually develop fixed airflow obstruction over time (and hence COPD) but they should be considered ‘patients’ (because they already suffer symptoms and/or have functional and/or structural abnormalities) and, as such, they deserve care and treatment,” the report authors stated. “The challenge is that there is no evidence on what the best treatment is for these patients yet.”
Hyperinflation refers to gas volume in the lungs increasing relative to normal values at the end of spontaneous expiration. It is clinically relevant among patients with COPD and may lead to dyspnea, impaired exercise tolerance, increased hospitalizations, respiratory failure, and increased mortality. Hyperinflation in patients with COPD occurs after the loss of elastic recoil and expiratory flow obstruction.
“The lung can be hyperinflated at rest (static hyperinflation due to the loss of elastic lung recoil as a consequence of emphysema) and/or during exercise (dynamic hyperinflation as a consequence of airflow obstruction) when ventilatory demands are increased and expiratory times are reduced,” the report authors noted.
Lung volumes from body plethysmography or gas dilution are reference measurements for evaluating hyperinflation, although these measures may vary owing to differences in compressible gas volumes or communicating gas volumes. Hyperinflation in patients may be managed with bronchodilators, supplemental oxygen, heliox, pulmonary rehabilitation, pursed lip breathing, or inspiratory muscle training.  In some cases of emphysema, where severe hyperinflation may occur, the condition may warrant lung reduction surgery or bronchoscopic lung reduction techniques.
According to the 2024 GOLD report, prebronchodilator spirometry may be used to initially assess whether symptomatic patients have airflow obstruction. If this does not show obstruction, postbronchodilator spirometry is not needed unless a very high clinical suspicion of COPD occurs, in which case an FVC volume response may show FEV1/FVC is less than 0.7. Additional tests to evaluate the cause of a patient’s symptoms and follow-up, including repeat spirometry, may be needed.
“If the prebronchodilator values show obstruction the diagnosis of COPD should be confirmed using postbronchodilator measurements,” noted the report authors. “Individuals with a prebronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio <0.7 that increases to ≥0.7 postbronchodilator have been shown to have an increased risk of future development of COPD, and should be followed closely.”
The report authors noted that interpreting lung function impairment severity relies on having appropriate reference values and that lung reference values change over time and require revising.
Evaluating symptoms and conducting spirometry in patients having low-dose chest computed tomography for lung cancer screening provides an opportunity to screen individuals for unrecognized COPD symptoms and airflow obstruction, noted the report authors. Male sex, younger age, shorter smoking duration, and being asymptomatic have been linked to detection of airflow obstruction without a previous diagnosis of COPD.
In addition to cigarette smoking, developmental, genetic, and environmental exposures and childhood infections also may increase the risk for COPD, and patients with these risk factors may have chest imaging for assessment of respiratory symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) scans can help identify patients with an increased risk for COPD and for whom spirometry may be considered in the non-lung cancer screening population.
“The use of spirometry in targeted patients undergoing lung cancer screening or when incidental imaging abnormalities are found consistent with parenchymal or airway manifestations of airways disorders is recommended by GOLD,” stated the report authors.
Blood eosinophil counts are recommended by GOLD to guide the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in pharmacologic management. Evidence has shown that patients with COPD may have increased average blood eosinophil counts, which may be associated with increased lung eosinophil numbers and levels of markers of type-2 inflammation in the airways. “Blood eosinophil counts can help clinicians estimate the likelihood of a beneficial preventive response to the addition of ICS to regular bronchodilator treatment, and thus can be used as a biomarker in conjunction with clinical assessment when making decisions regarding ICS use,” according to the committee.
Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) refer to findings suggestive of parenchymal lung fibrosis or inflammation from CT imaging in individuals who smoke or those who don’t smoke when observed incidentally among patients without known interstitial lung disease. Fibrotic ILA have an increased likelihood of progressing and are associated with poor outcomes, particularly in patients with emphysema. Evidence supports clinical assessment, risk stratification, and follow-up in patients with these findings.
The GOLD report advises clinicians to identify patients using tobacco at every visit, to strongly urge these patients to quit, and to assess each patient’s willingness to attempt to quit. Providing a quit plan and practical counseling as well as scheduling follow-up are also key steps to aid patients. Research has shown that a combination of counseling and pharmacotherapy is the most effective smoking cessation therapy for patients with COPD, noted the committee.
The Tobacco Use & Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline Panel found that brief smoking cessation counseling is effective, and that patients who use tobacco should be offered advice at each contact. Effective forms of counseling include practical counseling, social support of family and friends as part of treatment, and social support outside of treatment. Recommended first-line pharmacotherapies for tobacco dependence include varenicline, nortriptyline, bupropion sustained release, nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray, and nicotine patch, and the panel recommends that at least 1 of these medications should be prescribed when no contraindications occur.
Vaping is not recommended as a smoking cessation strategy. Electronic cigarettes contain nicotine and other chemicals, and their long-term effects in those who smoke and patients with COPD are largely unknown, noted the report authors. “Based on the available evidence, and the lack of knowledge about the long-term effects of e-cigarettes on respiratory health, it is not possible to recommend this intervention for smoking cessation in patients with COPD,” said the report authors.
In a meta-analysis that compared nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, nortriptyline, and varenicline with placebo in patients with COPD who smoke, all pharmacotherapies except nortriptyline increased the likelihood for smoking cessation.
Among the available pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation, nicotine replacement therapy in the form of gum, inhaler, nasal spray, transdermal patch, tablet, or lozenge can reliably increase long-term smoking abstinence rates, although it also can cause irritation at the administration site, according to the committee.
Managing inhaled therapy requires appropriate use of inhaler devices to maximize the benefits and lower the risks. At least 33 inhaled therapies have different bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combinations, and at least 22 inhaler devices are available. Each device has its own set of instructions, and more than two-thirds of patients make at least 1 error in using a device, noted the authors.
Selecting the right inhaler device depends on drug availability, device characteristics, the patient’s abilities and preferences, and clinicians’ knowledge in caring for the patient. The report authors advised that device types should be minimized and not be switched without clinical justification. “Shared decision-making is the most appropriate strategy for inhalation device choice,” stated the report authors. “Patients’ cognition, dexterity, and strength must be taken into account.”
GOLD advises that patients with COPD should receive all recommended vaccinations according to relevant guidelines. Influenza vaccination is recommended in patients with stable COPD, and the World Health Organization and US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The CDC also recommends 1 dose of the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or 1 dose of 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for those with stable COPD. The CDC recommends the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in individuals over 60 years of age and/or with chronic heart or lung disease, as well as the Tdap vaccine for protection against pertussis in patients with COPD who did not receive the vaccination in adolescence and the herpes zoster vaccine for shingles protection in individuals with COPD who are over 50 years of age.
Raising awareness of COPD and the importance of early detection and prevention of this diseases is an ongoing priority for GOLD, said report authors. “The GOLD initiative will continue to work with national leaders and other interested health care professionals to bring COPD to the attention of governments, public health officials, health care workers, and the general public to raise awareness of the burden of COPD and to develop programs for early detection, prevention, and approaches to management,” the report authors stated.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/chevron-overturned-physicians-affected/,"Chevron Overturned: FDA at a Crossroads, But How Will Physicians Be Affected?","On June 28, 2024, the United States Supreme Court overturned the doctrine of Chevron deference, revoking the power of administrative agencies to interpret the statutes of ambiguous laws.1 Although this major court decision made headlines in the news, many physicians still have lingering questions about how this change will have a downstream effect on the health care industry.
We spoke with pharmacist and attorney Susan C Winckler to get more information. Ms Winckler is the CEO of the Reagan-Udall Foundation, the non-profit organization created by Congress to advance the mission of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). She has also served as President of Leavitt Partners Solutions, a national healthcare strategy firm founded by Governor Michael O Leavitt, former Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. With Chevron overturned, Winckler elucidates what this ruling means for physicians.
The Chevron ruling came out of the landmark 1984 case Chevron USA, Inc v Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that courts can defer to an administrative agency’s interpretation of statutes as long as those interpretations are “reasonable.”2
For the past 40 years, the Chevron deference doctrine was a foundational administrative law principle. Agencies were granted authority to interpret specific statutes, given that the courts felt the agency’s expertise made them the most suitable authority on certain laws. However, critics of the doctrine felt it gave too much power to unelected government officials, and that law interpretation should remain with the courts.2
The specific cases that brought Chevron deference into question involved the National Marine Fisheries Service of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, which is a statute from 1976 that aimed to prevent overfishing.3 The National Marine Fisheries Service is an agency that required herring vessel owners to pay for contracted monitors. In 2 court cases, these owners challenged the agency’s authority to force vessel owners to bear this expense. District courts ruled in favor of the agency under Chevron, and the DC Circuit and First Circuit also affirmed these decisions.
However, the Supreme Court reviewed these cases to decide if Chevron deference should be overruled or clarified. Ultimately, the Supreme Court decided to overturn Chevron, stating that the court has the final say in interpreting the law; agencies do not.3
Although Chevron was overturned, the Supreme Court stated that past decisions based on Chevron should not be put up for review. Nonetheless, the ruling is likely to increase litigation in the lower courts in response to any agency actions.3
According to Winckler, the Chevron ruling has made the administrative branch more cautious about taking actions that are further removed from the statutes. As such, statute writing has slowed as Congress has been more cautious. Winckler says agencies across the board are focusing more on documentation and tighter reviews to tie decisions back to the statutes.
Although other industries may feel the effects of Chevron more than the medical industry, Winckler explained that Chevron may likely affect the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, given that it’s so routinely reviewed. “Congress looks at the FDA’s authorizing statute frequently – there is some greater familiarity and a must-pass package every 2 or 3 years. Congress has to respond to litigation and change statutes as needed or move into more specific statutes,” she shared.
Highly regulated prescription medications may be less vulnerable to Chevron-related changes, but Winckler feels digital tools could be affected. “The regulation of digital tools for mental health may be under more scrutiny. The FDA has a regulatory pathway for approving health interventions and deciding which ones need to come before the agency,” she explained. “If you have a digital tool developer or a physician who doesn’t think the FDA should regulate those tools, they may challenge that. They may become more available without the same safety and regulatory oversight.”
With Chevron overturned, many physicians are uncertain about how this may affect medications. Winckler anticipates that “the drug component may be more settled than other areas,” but added cannabis, ketamine, and psychedelics could run into some challenges. “It will be interesting to see how the overturning of Chevron may impact things like ketamine clinics. What could happen is that a drug developer decides to get an approved indication for ketamine that’s not already approved, which would give them patent protection and clear up the market for these other ketamine clinics,” she remarked. “That may lead to litigation from other ketamine clinics to say it’s outside the agency’s purview to regulate it.”
Other legal experts have suggested that overturning Chevron may embolden pharmaceutical companies who have criticized agency decisions in the past but didn’t go as far as to challenge them in court. In the “post-Chevron” world, litigation against the FDA’s interpretation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act may increase, especially given the high economic stakes of patent and exclusivity decisions.3
Behavioral health practices may also feel the effects of overturning Chevron, as lower courts will have more authority over the regulation of behavioral health.4 Those opposed to the change have expressed concern that courts don’t have the same expertise as agencies to make decisions on behavioral health regulation. They feel agencies are more well-versed in the complexities of mental health treatment. However, those in favor of overturning Chevron have argued that judges are legal experts who are the best suited to interpret laws, regardless of the subject matter.
Health care organizations have expressed concerns that overturning Chevron would disrupt publicly funded health insurance programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. As a result, this change could directly affect a large number of behavioral health providers operating under these plans.4
Winckler says the overturning of Chevron should not affect physicians or practicing psychiatrists just yet. However, the future is still somewhat uncertain. She explained, “The relative deference you typically give to the federal agency no longer applies. It’s not as if a wholesale change will happen outside the courtroom. It’s solely going to affect litigation, and it may inspire more litigation on past decisions.”
She also explained, “A lot of litigation comes from market exclusivity and patents because that’s where motivation comes from. When moving products from prescription to over-the-counter status, the FDA must determine whether there should be a longer exclusivity.”
Winckler says physicians must remain vigilant when making prescribing decisions and stay current with the laws surrounding all mental health interventions.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/access-care-issues-complicate-prescribing-obesity-medications/,Access to Care Issues Complicate Prescribing Obesity Medications,"There is an overwhelming demand for medications to manage obesity, although issues with access, cost, and insurance complicate the landscape of obesity treatment.
Sandra Christensen, MSN, ARNP, FNP-BC, MFOMA, FAANP, has 19 years of experience as an obesity medicine specialist. She owns an obesity treatment clinic in Seattle, is an associate editor for Obesity Pillars, is a trustee for the Obesity Medicine Association, and is the president of the Washington Obesity Society. Ms Christensen spoke with Clinical Advisor about the latest obesity medications and the barriers clinicians and patients face to prescribing and taking them.
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a number of medications for long-term use in weight management, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) medications (liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide).
While off-label prescribing of GLP-1 RAs and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 RAs used to be more prevalent in obesity management, at the start of the year, many insurance providers made it more difficult for clinicians to prescribe this category of medications without a diagnosis of diabetes, Ms Christensen said.
“I had so many people taking off-label GLP-1 RAs and GIP/GLP_1 RAs and their Medicare supplemental plan was paying for them without requiring a prior [authorization],” she said. “Then my patients started receiving letters that [Medicare was] not going to cover them after January 1, 2024, unless they have diabetes.”
As is the case with many disease states, patients with obesity often face barriers to accessing affordable care. Ms Christensen explained that in many ways, obesity treatment has become a class issue.
“Access is a big problem,” she said. “There is so much demand for the medications. If you don’t have insurance coverage, it’s really difficult to afford them. People with means can pay out of pocket for them.”
While it is still easier to access obesity treatment for patients who are privately insured and patients who can afford to pay out of pocket, state Medicaid programs are working to close gaps. A growing number of states are covering them for their Medicaid recipients, including California, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Mississippi, among others. Some Medicaid programs such as Montana and Washington are now covering semaglutide 2.4 mg (Wegovy) for patients with a history of cardiovascular events and overweight or obesity.
Removing burdens on clinicians like prior authorization is crucial to helping more patients access obesity medications, especially in primary care settings.
“It’s so intense,” Ms Christensen said. “Especially when they changed all the rules and they were denying everybody and then you’re doing all these appeals. From January 1st to probably mid-March, I just felt like my life was a living hell.”
Ms Christensen takes a comprehensive approach to obesity management with lifestyle changes serving as the foundation of a patient’s weight reduction plan. Obesity medications and bariatric surgery should be considered as an adjunct to nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral counseling, she said.
Anticipatory guidance is the key to counseling patients who are about to initiate an obesity medication, particularly a GLP-1RA or GIP/GLP-1 RA.
“You want to let them know what the potential side effects are, and then give them strategies that can help prevent them or lessen their severity,” Ms Christensen said. “I counsel patients to eat frequently, eat first thing in the morning, eat small meals, avoid high-fat meals, stop eating when they’re full, and let them know that the side effects will likely be worse with the first couple of doses [of medication] or after a dose increase.”
Some patients can experience side effects as their dose increases even if they did not experience any issues when they started the medication, Ms Christensen said. She noted that if a patient is struggling to manage side effects after a dose escalation, it may be appropriate to cease dose escalations in that patient until the side effects dissipate or become more manageable. Sometimes people don’t tolerate the full dose of a medication.
When a patient reduces their weight by taking medication, they may soon find themselves in a paradoxical predicament: what happens now that they no longer meet the prior authorization requirements for the medication that helps them maintain their weight reduction?
Ms Christensen explained that in most cases, patients’ obesity medication will still be covered by their insurance provider even if their weight reduction is to the extent that they no longer meet the BMI requirements. However, this is not always the case. She has experienced issues with pharmacy benefit managers and insurance companies who did not immediately cover a patient’s medication after their weight got below a certain BMI, requiring her to navigate additional red tape to restore patients’ access to their medication.
The underlying issue, Ms Christensen said, is that society does not always perceive obesity as a disease the same way it does for other diseases. Obesity medications are often seen as drugs that treat cosmetic issues, rather than a life-threatening chronic disease, she said.
Ms Christensen advises her patients to continue taking obesity medications for as long as they continue to experience the benefits, including improvement of obesity-related health issues and improved quality of life. This comes as a shock to some patients and clinicians who perceive weaning off obesity medications as the ultimate goal.
“When I speak on the topic of obesity medications and emphasize that they are part of the treatment plan for managing a chronic disease, [I get] questions from clinicians, [like] ‘How long do you keep people on these meds?’ ‘How do you taper them off?’ It’s like, well, we really don’t. The body is programmed to store energy. And whenever we reduce weight, it fights back with increases in hunger hormones, decreased satiety hormones, and decreased resting metabolic rate. You’re not going to get to this place where everything is just stable without the meds,” she said.
As data from more and more clinical trials underscores the efficacy of obesity medications, Ms Christensen predicts that insurance companies will increase their coverage of these medications.
“I think with all these trials that are looking at other health outcomes, it’s going to push the needle over to where insurance companies have to cover them,” she said. “I think that with all the new agents coming along, that’s going to really help in the marketplace in terms of reducing the cost because that really needs to come down. It just can’t be this expensive.”
Over the next few years, several new obesity medications will be up for FDA approval. As the number of available medications increases, Ms Christensen is hopeful that more patients will be able to access obesity treatment. She is also hopeful that combining multiple medications may be a promising strategy for obesity management in the future.
“What I’ve known forever, is that when you treat obesity first, other conditions improve, and now we’re getting the evidence to show that,” she said.",Michelle Falci; Nikki Kean
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome-cvs/,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome: AGA Issues Practice Update on Diagnosis and Management,"The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) has published a clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). The report was published in Gastroenterology.
The AGA Governing Board and the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) published this guidance to provide pertinent updates for health care providers who manage patients with CVS. The recommendations include data from recently published studies and were written by experts in managing this condition.
Patients with CVS experience chronic, acute episodes of nausea, vomiting, and retching, which are separated from episode-free periods. As CVS is a disorder of the gut-brain connection, clinical criteria are used to diagnose the illness. Specifically, the following Rome IV criteria are used to diagnose patients with CVS:
The following American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society (ANMS) and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association (CVSA) criteria are used to distinguish the severity of CVS:
While most patients meet the Rome IV criteria for CVS, experts highlight key diagnostic clues for providers:
The prompt clinical recognition and diagnosis of CVS is key in management, although the ANMS-CVSA guidelines recommend some tests to rule out similar conditions. A patient’s workup should include blood work and a urinalysis. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy or other upper gastrointestinal imaging can be used for the exclusion of other conditions; repeated imaging should be avoided. Cannabis use can interfere with the interpretation of imaging results.
Patients with CVS experience 4 phases of illness: well, prodromal, emetic, and recovery. Each phase has a different treatment and management goals.
Some patients experience coalescent CVS, which is a worsening progression of symptoms with increased episode length and frequency and fewer to no asymptomatic days. Management of this stage remains a challenge, and patients should be provided with prophylactic therapy for their symptoms.
Some patients have developed methods of alleviating CVS symptoms, including cannabis use and self-induced vomiting.
Although many patients use cannabis recreationally or for symptom alleviation of CVS, its distinction from cannabinoid hyperemesis (CHS) is unclear. Experts have suggested that CHS is a type of CVS when symptoms occur for over 1 year with heavy cannabis use (>4 times weekly) before symptom onset. In contrast, cannabis use in patients with CVS tends to be more occasional and to self-soothe symptoms.
To retroactively diagnose CHS, a patient should halt cannabis use for over 6 months or at least 3 cycle lengths; CHS can be ruled out if a patient continues to experience symptoms. Patients who use cannabis often face a stigma from providers that can lead to issues accessing treatment. These patients must be managed the same as patients without cannabis use, as it can still provide benefit.
While the emetic phase is associated with uncontrolled vomiting, providers tend to overlook symptoms of retching or unremitting nausea, both of which can be equally debilitating. Patients may drink large amounts of water or self-induce vomit by sticking fingers into their throat to provide temporary relief in this phase. These behaviors should not be mistaken for malingering and should be recognized as unique to this condition.
Mood disorders are commonly associated with CVS, as 50% to 60% of patients report anxiety, depression, or panic disorder. In addition, approximately 20% to 30% of patients with CVS report migraines and approximately 3% experience seizure disorders. Collaboration between health care services, including neurologists, psychiatrists, and sleep specialists, are important in managing patients with CVS. Psychological and physiological factors trigger CVS episodes in approximately 70% to 80% of patients. Some lifestyle modifications recommended to patients include attempting to avoid triggers, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding prolonged fasting, and practicing stress management techniques.
Patients with moderate-severe CVS should receive prophylactic treatment. Experts state that the goal of prophylactic medications in CVS is to prolong the well phase and/or reduce the severity and length of the emetic phase. The ANMS-CVSA guidelines recommend the following prophylactic treatments based on case series and expert opinion:
Abortive therapy is recommended to avoid the emetic phase or reduce its severity. This treatment is recommended for both mild and moderate-severe CVS. The sooner abortive therapies are taken in the prodromal phase, the higher the probability of aborting an episode. The ANMS-CVSA guidelines recommend the following abortive treatments based on case series and expert opinion:
While some patients respond to monotherapy, most patients require combination therapy with 2 or more agents to stop CVS episodes. The most common combination includes sumatriptan and an antiemetic agent. Sumatriptan can be administered intranasally, which is useful if a patient is actively retching and vomiting. Promethazine and prochlorperazine are available as a suppository and ondansetron is available as a sublingual tablet. Sedatives can be useful in patients experiencing an episode, with the rectal form of alprazolam available as a useful option during an episode. Fluid restoration is the priority in the recovery phase of CVS.
Patients presenting to the ED with uncontrolled retching and vomiting should be treated, even if there is suspicion of CHS. Abdominal pain typically presents with CVS episodes and severe pain may require narcotic pain medication to supplement the abortive regimen, while non-narcotic pain relievers are preferred. Experts recommend intravenous ketorolac as the first-line, non-narcotic medication to treat severe abdominal pain in patients with CVS. It is recommended for patients to be placed in a quiet, dark room in addition to receiving intravenous (IV) benzodiazepines to induce sedation. Other sedating antipsychotic medications (droperidol and haloperidol) are typically reserved for the ED. All patients admitted to the ED should receive IV dextrose-containing fluids and IV administration of medications.
Due to the fundamental lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of CVS, it remains a challenge to develop treatments. In addition, further research should be conducted to understand the comorbidities common among patients with CVS. Recent studies have identified racial disparities in clinical outcomes among patients with CVS and future research is required to understand the reasons for this gap.
“Fortunately, the increasing recognition of CVS and its profound impact on patients and the health care system are likely to motivate progress in the years to come,” the guideline authors stated.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/assault-on-diversity-equity-inclusion/,"The Assault on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion","The July/August Washington State Medical Association (WSMA) publication, WSMA Reports, has an insightful and concise history of the trajectory of the hotly contested topic of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts in Washington. It’s lead paragraph notes:
In the summer of 2020, after the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Manual Ellis, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd, many corporations and higher education institutions nationwide issued statements condemning racism and committing themselves to the hard work of diversity, equity, and inclusion. For a few years, DEI efforts flourished, with colleges and universities creating related statements, policies, programs, and offices.
As the piece notes, a movement of backlash against these efforts has been strong and sustained since early 2023. According to the WSMA piece, it began when 2 right-leaning organizations, the Manhattan Institute and the Goldwater Institute, described a multi-pronged approach to attacking DEI. The Manhattan Institute describes itself on its website as a community of scholars, journalists, activists, and civic leaders dedicated to advancing opportunity, individual liberty, and the rule of law in America and its great cities.
Their January 18, 2023 Issue Brief is titled “Abolish DEI Bureaucracies and Restore Colorblind Equality in Public Universities” In the brief, it is noted:
There is a lot that state legislatures can do to reverse the illiberal takeover of higher education through DEI offices that ironically, stifle intellectual diversity, prevent equal opportunity, and exclude anyone who dissents from a rigid orthodoxy. Here are 4 proposals for reforming public universities:
These rather straightforward reforms would go back to the negative trends that have afflicted higher education.
According to the WSMA newsletter, there have been over 80 “anti-DEI” bills proposed in US state legislatures with language similar to the Manhattan Institute wording above. Of these, it is reported that 14 have become laws, another 14 have moved towards approval, and 47 have failed to progress.
The state of Washington has been fortunate to have avoided this movement to date. In 2021, Washington approved legislation requiring higher education institutions to provide professional development for faculty regarding anti-racism and DEI initiatives. As of the publication of the WSMA Reports, no anti-DEI legislation had been proposed in the state of Washington.
As of May 2024, Best Colleges features a “DEI Tracker,” an excellent resource for those interested in tracking efforts nationwide to restrict DEI efforts in the academic community, with state-by-state anti-DEI legislation.
States that have passed anti-DEI legislation include Idaho, Utah, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, Iowa, Tennessee, Alabama, and Florida.
States with anti-DEI legislation introduced with no passage yet include Oregon, Montana, Arizona, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Indiana, Kentucky, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia.
States “on watch” or where no bills have been introduced include Washington, California, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia.
One of the helpful features of this site is its state-by-state description of specifics of the efforts by legislators to limit DEI efforts.
Three universities in Washington have joined forces in fighting restrictions on DEI and promoting DEI initiatives. These include the Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences in Yakima, the Spokane Medical School at Washington State University, and the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.
In the WSMA Reports piece about DEI, Pacific Northwest University’s Mirna Ramos-Diaz, MD, MA, FAAP describes the summary of the goals of DEI, and the rationale for making DEI a high priority in the Washington state medical schools.
DEI is taught through what she refers to as “the restorative practice lens, which begins during orientation when students are placed in community-building circles. Students are asked to bring in an object that relates to their journey to the health sciences and share what it means to them.” She notes, “We allow everyone to be heard, equally. When they get to know each other, they’re more likely to collaborate with that person, less likely to cause harm to that person, or are more likely to be thoughtful, and engage and share resources … And, holy moly, they begin seeing their similarities, amidst their differences.” From there, PNWU students are given lessons on restorative justice, which places community well-being at its center, says Dr Ramos-Diaz. “It balances accountability with support. This is never about blaming. It is always about ‘how do we repair harm in the community?”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/health-care-worker-burnout/,Does Organizational Support Help Reduce Health Care Worker Burnout?,"Retention of quality health care workers is important for all health care facilities, and burnout is an important barrier to retention.  Both clinician-level and organizational-level solutions are required to address burnout. In this literature review, we discuss examples of organizations that have taken on the issue of burnout to help foster healthier environments for health care workers. By providing these examples, we offer PAs and physicians ideas they can present to their organizations to advocate for their well-being.  Likewise, the article provides organizations with positive examples of how they can better support their employees. Lastly, we discuss gaps in the literature and opportunities for further study on this important topic.
Burnout has long been a problem for health care workers, and the problem was magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the factors that contribute to burnout include having little control over decisions, long-standing stressful situations, and a perceived lack of support from leaders.1 Maslach coined the phrase burnout in 1974, suggesting that it involved mental exhaustion, depersonalization, and “a reduced sense of accomplishment at work.”2 Remedies to combat burnout are varied but mostly have focused on the individual level.  While empowering individual health care workers to incorporate healthy lifestyle changes is important, these changes alone cannot combat burnout.
Through original research and literature reviews, researchers have explored how organizational changes can affect burnout. Although much of the literature focuses on burnout as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic, burnout is not a recent problem.2 This study found a similar level of burnout among physicians and surgeons, as well as medical students.2 A study focusing on PAs in Germany showed that signs of depression and anxiety occurred in this group when overall job satisfaction was low.3  In 2019, the American Academy of Physician Associates published the results of a national survey that revealed that approximately 33% of PAs reported signs of burnout.4  These examples show how burnout affects a broad range of health care professionals.
The current literature on health care worker burnout focuses on the causes of the problem, its consequences, and solutions. Much of the literature discusses individual-level solutions to burnout, but some researchers have acknowledged that burnout requires a multifactorial approach and have researched organizational-level changes.2,5
The current literature involves much discussion about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on burnout and how it has amplified this long-standing problem.  One research group used an online questionnaire that included the patient health questionnaire and Maslach Burnout Inventory to assess the mental health of health care professionals working during the pandemic.6 The results showed that the signs of anxiety, stress, and burnout were related to the workers’ “perceived lack of professional support.”6
Another study looking at 368 health care workers in Iran showed that 36% of the participants demonstrated signs of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic.7  In this study, the authors explored how an organizational change, such as improving the use of electronic health record (EHR) features, could help alleviate stress. In addition, the researchers showed that improvements in leadership approaches, such as transparent communication, clear expectations, and better workflow, all contributed to decreasing signs of burnout.
A literature review conducted by a team at the University of Maryland School of Medicine looked at duty of care as it related to organizational responsibility during the pandemic.8 They compared the responsibility health care workers have to their patients with the responsibility employers have to their employees. They suggested that when organizations exercise this duty to their employees, levels of burnout are lower. The review provides a relevant history of the subject of organizational responsibility by citing legal statutes such as The British Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974 and the International Labor Office Occupational Safety and Health Convention of 1981. The researchers acknowledged that although burnout is a longstanding problem, the pandemic magnified some hidden issues.  Reviewing organizational responsibility failures that occurred during the pandemic can provide additional opportunities to discuss burnout and solutions.
Some studies on burnout have focused on the individual as the agent responsible for making changes, with individual-level recommendations including increasing physical activity, improving diet, getting counseling, achieving a better work-life balance, and participating in social activities.2 While all these recommendations can play a part in reducing burnout, they only address one part of a large, complex puzzle. Furthermore, in their review article, Carrau et al point out that focusing on individual can in some ways be compared to victim-blaming because there is evidence that individuals exhibit burnout as a reaction to their environment.2
Therefore, some researchers have reported on specific organizational-level changes that have shown some promise to help combat burnout.  DeChant et al studied burnout among health care employees at hospitals in Pakistan.5 They describe the concept of internal corporate social responsibility, a management strategy that focuses on multiple aspects of caring for employees, and suggest that employers of health care workers have a responsibility to prioritize their well-being.
Menzin et al conducted a review that evaluated the many facets of burnout and its effects on work life and personal life.9 They discuss various solutions, including flexible scheduling, mental health support, and other organizational interventions.  In addition, they also discuss the role of larger health care organizations such as the American Medical Association in helping to alleviate the burden of burnout.
In another study, Dyrbye et al sought to explore the role of mentoring in reducing levels of burnout in health care workers.10 They surveyed 14,500 employees at a cancer hospital and found that having a positive mentoring relationship helped reduce burnout. The researchers included detailed demographic information on the respondents, which strengthened the validity of the results. They noted that mentoring is just one method to address burnout.
Cavanaugh et al evaluated the role supervisors play in alleviating or aggravating burnout.11 They surveyed 39,896 non-physician health care employees, including PAs, using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. They found that the more positively leadership was scored by respondents, the lower the rates of burnout.
Tanios et al tested the Mentoring and Professionalism in Training curriculum to see if it influenced burnout.12 Overall, 106 health care professionals, including PAs, participated in this study. The study started with a description of the common triple aim of improving health care, which includes improving patient experience, reducing cost, and improving population health. The researchers added the important aspect of improving the personal and professional experience of health care providers, thus creating a quadruple aim.12 All the participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory before and after their participation. After the study, the researchers found that the participants still experienced emotional exhaustion, but their sense of resilience and achievement had improved. This study provides another tool that organizations can implement to improve their employees’ overall job satisfaction.
DeChant et al conducted a systemic review of literature published from 2007 to 2018.5 They found that organizational policy changes had the greatest effect at combatting burnout and described 4 categories of organizational change: teamwork, time, transitions, and technology. Teamwork involves improving overall communication between coworkers and also their EHR.  Time related to making changes to clinic schedules to improve workflow, including changes to patient schedules as well as to clinician work hours. Transitions related to policy changes also help with workflow. Technology improvements focused on enhancing the use of EHR to reduce stress by making clinicians’ administrative duties easier.
These studies offer a useful view of the problem of burnout as well as solutions for organizational change. There is consistency among researchers as far as the definition of burnout, and most tend to use the early work of Christina Maslach and her burnout inventory as a gold standard for their research.2,9,12
The impact of COVID-19 on burnout was a major topic for much of the available recent literature.1,1,6-8 The pandemic exposed the problem of burnout in ways that may have been ignored otherwise. Researchers pointed out the consequences of a lack of organizational support and how this negatively affected health care workers during the early days of the pandemic.6
Perceived organizational support was a major trend in much of the literature.1,3 Clinicians who felt that they were supported by their leaders tended to report fewer symptoms of burnout. Workers reportedly perceived organizational support as having healthy and open communication with leaders, feeling like they have some control over workflow decisions, and having an employer that prioritizes employee mental health.  Organizations that implemented changes to workflow, EHR, and communications saw fewer reports of burnout symptoms among employees.
The research also highlighted the universality of the problem of burnout among health care workers.3,6,13 Some of the included articles were based in Germany, Pakistan, and Iran. This review does not extend to an in-depth analysis of cultural differences, but it shows that burnout is a problem for health care workers regardless of geographical location.
Most notable was the consensus on the consequences of burnout, which are profound and seen at all levels from organizational to personal. Burnout was shown to have negative effects on patient care, clinician mental health, health care costs, and employee retention.1,2 This review of the literature suggests that change on the organizational level is mandatory to combat burnout and mitigate its consequences.
This review of the literature on burnout and organizational solutions shows that there has been significant research into this subject in recent years, but there are still areas that need to be further explored. One limitation of this review was that few studies discussed the impact of burnout on PAs specifically, and many did not include PAs. As Benard and McMoon noted, more information is needed to see how the PA profession either protects against or exacerbates the problem of burnout.4
One trend reported in many studies was that women tended to indicate more feelings of burnout than men.1-3 It is unclear whether this trend shows a direct gender correlation for burnout because further review of the literature is needed to control for this factor. However, how burnout affects female workers is worth noting as organizations work to improve conditions for their employees.
To ensure the robustness of the health care system in the future, clinician burnout needs to be the focus of all involved entities. These studies have shown that patient care, health care costs, and the mental health of clinicians are all negatively affected by burnout. Solutions on the individual and organizational level can be applied, and in the future, it would be worthwhile to evaluate the role of governmental-level changes as well as the benefits of empowering clinicians to be change agents and advocates for better working conditions.","Cynthia M.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/lgbtq-patients-cancer-disparities-discrimination-lack-of-data-2/,"LGBTQ+ Patients and Cancer: Disparities, Discrimination, and a Lack of Data","Studies have suggested that certain risk factors for cancer are more common in LGBTQ+ patients, these patients may be more likely to develop certain cancers, and they may have worse outcomes than non-LGBTQ+ patients with cancer.1-26 However, researchers say a lack of robust data has made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about how cancer affects the LGBTQ+ community.1
“Data about sexual orientation and gender identity is not routinely collected in health care,” explained Tyler Kratzer, associate scientist at the American Cancer Society and first author of a recent study on cancer in LGBTQ+ patients.1
Kratzer noted that, because US cancer registries rely on data from health care facilities, there is a lack of data on cancer in LGBTQ+ patients. Nevertheless, Kratzer and colleagues compiled available data in an attempt to gain insights regarding cancer risk factors, screening, incidence, and outcomes in LGBTQ+ patients in the United States.
Kratzer and colleagues found that compliance with recommended cancer screening in LGBTQ+ patients was largely similar to compliance in non-LGBTQ+ patients.1 Transgender men had lower rates of colorectal cancer screening than any other group, and transgender patients had lower rates of cervical cancer screening than cisgender women, but rates of other screenings were similar across groups.However, a study presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting 2024 revealed a low rate of screening among LGBTQ+ patients.2,3 Of the 817 LGBTQ+ cancer patients evaluated, 80% did not receive appropriate cancer screening for their age. Reasons for this lack of screening included the provider not mentioning it to the patient, the patient not having a provider for routine care, and the patient not having health insurance.There is also evidence to suggest that LGBTQ+ patients tend to be diagnosed with cancers later than non-LGBTQ+ patients, which could be due, in part, to a lack of screening.1,4
Kratzer’s study also suggested that some LGBTQ+ patients had more cancer risk factors than their non-LGBTQ+ counterparts.1 For example, smoking was more common among LGBTQ+ youth, lesbian and bisexual women were more likely than heterosexual women to be overweight, transgender patients were more likely than cisgender patients to be obese, and bisexual women were more likely than heterosexual or lesbian women to consume excessive amounts of alcohol (more than 7 drinks per week).
On the other hand, rates of HPV and HBV vaccination were higher among lesbian, gay, and bisexual men than among heterosexual men. Among women, HPV vaccination rates were highest among bisexuals, followed by heterosexuals and lesbians. HBV vaccination rates were highest among lesbian women, followed by heterosexual and bisexual women.
“It was great to see the data on HPV and HBV,” said Matthew Schabath, PhD, research program lead in the cancer epidemiology program at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, who was not involved in this study. “Both of these viruses can cause cancer, and HPV is particularly concerning, so it was very encouraging to see the higher rates of those vaccines in LGB people.”
A study published last year revealed higher rates of bone, genitourinary, gynecologic, hematologic, skin, and thyroid cancers among lesbian, gay, and bisexual patients than among heterosexual patients.5,6
And a study published in May of this year suggested that, compared to heterosexual women, lesbian women may have higher rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroid cancer, and basal cell carcinoma.7,8
A range of other studies have shown disparities in breast cancer, gynecologic cancers, and prostate cancer between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ patients as well.1
In their article, Kratzer and colleagues noted that lesbian and bisexual women “likely have a higher risk of breast cancer because of higher prevalence of risk factors, including fewer childbirths and higher prevalence of alcohol use and excess body weight.”1
One study showed a 10% higher risk of breast cancer among bisexual women and a 6% higher risk among lesbian women when compared to heterosexual cisgender women.1,9 Data have also suggested that transgender men have a higher risk of breast cancer than cisgender men, and this may be due to a lack of top surgery or incomplete breast tissue removal during surgery.1,10
Transgender men have been shown to have a lower risk of breast cancer than transgender women, which may be due to the use of estrogen-containing hormone therapy.1,11,12
One study showed that LGBTQ+ patients were more likely than cisgender and heterosexual women to experience delays between symptom onset and breast cancer diagnosis, to decline oncologist-recommended treatment, and to experience breast cancer recurrence.1,13 Researchers speculated that these findings could be a result of patient distrust of health care providers and/or provider bias against LGBTQ+ patients. 1,14
“We [LGBTQ+ people] do have increased risk factors for cancer, and these are honestly all really related to discrimination, which is the core factor uniting all of these increased risks,” said Scout, PhD, executive director of the National LGBT Cancer Network in Providence, Rhode Island, who identifies as trans, nonbinary, and bisexual and is a co-author of the Kratzer paper.1
Gynecologic cancers have been reported in transgender men who have undergone gender-affirming surgery.1,15 Researchers have hypothesized that testosterone therapy may increase the risk of hormone-responsive endometrial and ovarian cancers because it can be converted to estrogen in the body, but epidemiologic study findings are inconsistent.1,15,16
Compared to cisgender women, transgender men may have a greater risk of developing cervical cancer and dying from it due to lower rates of cervical cancer screening, Kratzer and colleagues noted.1,15-17 They added that transgender men may face barriers to gynecologic care, such as discomfort with female sex organs, the need to disclose their transgender status, and fear of receiving a gynecologic examination, although there is conflicting evidence related to these barriers.
“These fears may lead to delayed diagnosis and worse health outcomes and can be addressed, in part, by increasing provider awareness and normalizing a broad range of patient backgrounds,” Kratzer and colleagues wrote.1
Study results have not yet clarified whether gay or biosexual patients are more likely to develop prostate cancer than their heterosexual peers.1,18
However, it is known that transgender women remain at risk of developing prostate cancer even after gender-affirming surgery.1,19 Transgender women receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy appear to have a lower risk of prostate cancer than cisgender men, but there is some evidence to suggest that transgender women are more likely to have aggressive disease.1,20,21
A study published earlier this month suggested that transgender women and cisgender men had a similar risk of metastatic prostate cancer at presentation, high-risk localized disease, and prostate cancer-specific death, but transgender women had superior overall survival.22
Another study published earlier this month showed that lesbian, gay, and bisexual cancer survivors were more likely to experience financial hardship than their heterosexual peers.23,24
And a study published in June showed that LGBTQ+ cancer survivors were more likely than non-LGBTQ+ survivors to have chronic health conditions and disabilities, including asthma, depressive disorders, kidney disease, stroke, diabetes, vision disability, cognitive limitations, and difficulty walking, dressing, and running errands.25,26
If steps are not taken to reduce disparities between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ patients, inequalities will worsen with time, Dr Schabath speculated.
“We are doing a much better job of treating cancer patients with targeted therapies, immune therapies, early diagnosis, and early screening,” Dr Schabath said. “Patients are going to start living longer, and these disparities will only get worse over time if we don’t address [them].”
At ASCO 2024, researchers reported that 30% of 115 oncology providers surveyed were unsure how to discuss sexual orientation and gender identity with patients, and 36% of providers were unsure how this information may affect treatment considerations.2,27
Most providers (65%) predicted that patients would feel safe disclosing their LGBTQ+ identity, but only 24% of the 817 LGBTQ+ patients surveyed said they would be at least moderately comfortable discussing their identity with their providers.
However, an educational intervention was able to improve communication between LGBTQ+ cancer patients and providers. The proportion of providers who said they were committed to always or often discussing gender identity and sexual orientation with cancer patients at the first visit increased substantially after the educational intervention — from 1% to 68% for providers at community centers and from 12% to 77% for providers at academic institutions.
Education led to other improvements in care as well. After the intervention, 46% of providers said their practices adopted resources tailored to the needs of LGBTQ+ cancer patients, 54% said their practices implemented gender neutral bathrooms, and 85% said their practices implemented inclusivity measures.
Dr Schabath noted that most patients at Moffitt Cancer Center complete a questionnaire that asks about their sexual orientation and gender identity. Since 2016, the questionnaire has been given to all patients treated at the center. Dr Schabath said completion rates are over 99% for the sexual orientation question and 91% for the gender identity question.
“We should be collecting data on sexuality and gender identity at every cancer center, health care system, and clinic in the US so we can continually track these disparities and come up with meaningful interventions to mitigate or eliminate them,” Dr Schabath said. “Cancer is not just what disease a patient has, what are the driver mutations or the protein expression of the tumor, it’s also about who they are, and, ultimately, we need this demographic data to deliver precision, personalized care.”
“We really encourage the medical system and providers and facilities not to choose for us [patients] by not letting us disclose our LGBTQ+ identities,” Dr Scout said. “Many of us care about our community and our health, and we should have the option to choose to disclose this information.”
Dr Scout also noted that there are many ways providers can show they care about LGBTQ+ patients and don’t want to perpetuate disparities. For example, providers can put their pronouns on their lanyards, wear rainbow lanyards, or wear “You are safe with me” buttons.
“Silence is loud, especially in this legislative environment, and it’s a statement we in the community hear,” Dr Scout said.
“I think one of the best solutions is that we need to provide education about the unique challenges that sexual and gender minorities face as early as possible,” Dr Schabath said. “In medical school, PA [physician assistant] school, nursing school, there has to be dedicated education because they are going to need it throughout their career. And I think this needs to be part of board exams.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/obesity-and-anesthesia/,Anesthesia Risk in Pediatric Patients With Obesity,"Obesity is a chronic health issue in America, affecting people of all ages. Specifically, the prevalence of obesity in childhood is increasing exponentially. This causes health problems that can affect multiple organ systems, likely into adulthood, and also increases perioperative risk.1 Children undergoing procedures requiring general anesthesia are at a greater risk for developing adverse events if they are obese.2 This paper discusses childhood obesity, its effects on organ systems, and its associated perioperative risks.
Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 in adults and weight at or greater than the 95th percentile in children.1 The prevalence of pediatric obesity has increased dramatically in recent years, from 16% between 2007 and 2008 to 19.7% between 2017 and 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).3 In more recent years, these numbers have grown even higher because of pandemic-related decreases in physical activity, increased caloric intake, and higher levels of stress. Current data indicate that childhood obesity affects 14.7 million children aged 2 to 19 years.4 This rate is expected to continue increasing as modernization and urbanization continue. The World Obesity Foundation has estimated that 206 million children aged 5 to 19 years will be living with obesity by 2025.5
Obesity is not limited to one race or ethnicity. In the CDC study, rates were 26.25% in Hispanic children, 24.8% in non-Hispanic Black children, 16.6% in non-Hispanic White children, and 9% in non-Hispanic Asian children.4 Obesity is also present across low-, middle-, and higher-income countries. In lower- to middle-income countries, higher socioeconomic status confers greater risk for obesity than lower socioeconomical status.1 In contrast, in higher-income countries, children living in socioeconomic disadvantage are at greater risk for being overweight and obese.
Childhood obesity is associated with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, sleep apnea, gastric diseases, depression, and other comorbidities,6 as well as perioperative concerns, such as respiratory and cardiovascular (CV) complications. A main perioperative concern is airway anatomy, which is different in children vs adults, and even more so in children with obesity. Children have a more anterior glottic opening, larger tongue-to-mouth ratio, and longer, floppier epiglottis.7 Their airways are also more prone to obstructing with neck flexion on a flat surface.7 In the presence of increased airway tissue, as in obesity, these features dramatically increase the risk for obstruction. Before a procedure, it is important for nurse practitioners (NPs) to complete a thorough airway assessment focusing on mouth opening, tonsil and adenoid size, and the ability of the child to sleep on a flat surface.
The NP also needs to investigate for signs of snoring or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This sleep-rated breathing disorder causes oxygen desaturation and is present in up to 80% of children and adolescents with obesity due to an increase in soft tissue around the pharyngeal airway.6,8 A review by Chidambaran et al notes that “for each increase unit increase of BMI above the mean in children, the risk of OSA increases by 12%.”8 The presence of OSA increases risk for airway obstruction, increases sensitivity to narcotic analgesics, and diminishes ventilatory response to CO2.8 The combination of OSA and high BMI increases risk for laryngospasm by 4-fold compared with non-obese BMI.9 Laryngospasm is a condition in which the vocal cords spasm involuntarily, causing airway obstruction that can occur rapidly. In patients with increased risk for OSA or diagnosed OSA, the NP should consider prolonged postoperative monitoring and possible hospital admission for overnight monitoring. The NP should also educate patients’ caregivers on the potential additive effects of anesthesia and opioids in a child with OSA and effective postoperative monitoring techniques.
Children with obesity also have an increased incidence of airway diseases. For example, asthma is present in 30% of this population.9 Obesity is associated with worsening asthma symptoms and poor response to corticosteroids.6 In addition, fat accumulation on the chest wall can decrease lung and chest wall compliance, intensify the work of breathing, and increase risk for upper respiratory infections. These effects can lead hypoxia and atelectasis in children.8 Perioperative considerations for NPs include thorough assessment of pulmonary function, asthma, and other airway diseases, including recent upper airway illnesses. Having this information available for anesthesia providers at the time of surgery reduces case cancellations and delays.
Obesity can have great effects on a child’s CV system as well. Children with increased BMI may develop coronary vascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis in the vascular structures of the heart, and have been found to have increased heart size, heart mass, and chamber size.9 These anatomical differences result in greater stroke volume and cardiac output compared.9 Many studies have shown that childhood and adolescent adiposity affect the structures and function of the heart.
In particular, children with obesity and OSA are at greater risk for left ventricular dysfunction. Prolonged hypoxia and increased carbon dioxide levels stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, increasing blood pressure.7 This causes the heart muscle to work harder than normal, which leads to enlargement and thickening in the left ventricle. In a study of 460 adolescents by Chinali et al, participants who were overweight or obese had greater left ventricle diameter and mass than those whose weight was considered normal.10 Patients with OSA can also have pulmonary hypertension, and if left untreated, this can lead to cor pulmonale.8 Anyone with a history of cardiac problems, systemic hypertension, or signs of ventricular dysfunction should undergo preoperative cardiology evaluation.8 NPs should complete a thorough CV assessment and consider consulting with pediatric cardiology for blood pressure management, echocardiography, and other imaging.
Before the date of surgery, it is important to have a comprehensive history in place and complete a physical examination. In the setting of pediatric obesity, the focus should be on the pulmonary and CV systems, as well as the airway, mouth, and neck. The morning of surgery, any changes in history or physical status should be addressed before proceeding with any elective procedures.
Children with obesity and asthma should be screened for potential flares and exacerbations. The severity of their asthma, current medication regimen, and history of hospital visits and anesthetic use should be noted. They should continue to take their usual asthma medications on the day of the procedure.
The presence of OSA should also warrant further investigation before the use of general anesthesia. If available, polysomnography or a sleep study would be beneficial. The severity of OSA will be important in anticipating any obstructive events that could occur during or after surgery. Children who are obese and have any type of pulmonary comorbidities should be assessed by pulmonologists and anesthesia providers preoperatively.11 Assessment for recent upper respiratory illness is imperative, as is consideration of postponement of elective surgery for any patient who has had a respiratory illness in the previous 6 weeks.
Difficult intravenous (IV) access is another potential issue in children who are obese, and this can delay or prolong surgery. Having a plan for IV access using distraction, local anesthesia, and ultrasound-guided cannulation is advised in this population. One randomized controlled study concluded that IV induction was safer than inhalational induction in children at risk for developing perioperative respiratory complications.12 Therefore, obtaining IV access prior to induction to anesthesia should be considered. Having equipment available for fast access can also lessen the stress on the child and minimize surgical delays.
Intraoperative considerations for children with obesity include airway and CV management. The anesthesia provider will secure the airway and maintain the patient’s vital signs throughout the procedure. Having the results of a comprehensive airway, pulmonary, and CV exam available for this provider can prevent or alleviate many intraoperative emergencies.
Postoperatively, children with obesity have greater risk for developing adverse respiratory events. They tend to have longer stays in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and frequent unexpected hospital admissions due to postoperative respiratory complications. There is no specific practice guideline for PACU care in this cohort; however, close monitoring of oxygen levels with pulse oximetry and/or capnography is advised.11 All children who are obese should be observed before discharge while unstimulated for any signs of apnea or hypopnea, which can increase the length of PACU stay.8 Lastly, these children, especially those with OSA, should be assessed by the surgical and anesthesia teams to determine the necessity of an overnight stay for close monitoring.
Children with obesity face increased perioperative risks. Understanding their anatomical, pulmonary, and CV needs is vital to providing safe care preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. As the prevalence of pediatric obesity continues to grow, it is imperative that the disease process and its perioperative implications are understood in order to best care for this population.","Vi Do, BSN RN; Katherine Meuti, DNP, MSN, CRNA, APRN"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/pcos-perimenopause-menopause/,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Perimenopause and Menopause,"This is the final installment of our 6-part series on the lifelong journey of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and the stops along the way. In this installment, Danielle R. Stratton, DNP, RN, PPCNP-BC, will discuss what a female with PCOS may face as they move into the perimenopausal and menopausal stages of life.
Perimenopause is considered the time of life in which the female body transitions to the end of the childbearing age and menopause. During this transitional stage, the ovaries begin producing fewer hormones, and this causes the menstrual cycle to become irregular and unpredictable. Menopause is the natural female hormonal reproductive decline when a woman reaches between the age of 40 and 50 years. It is signaled and defined by 12 months since her last menstruation. The menstrual cycle then ceases.1,2
Polycystic ovarian syndrome and menopause are both hormonal-related. It is important to know that menopause does not cure PCOS, which is a lifelong disorder. Polycystic ovarian syndrome symptoms are similar to perimenopausal symptoms, females with the syndrome are exposed to these symptoms for most of their lives. When a female with PCOS enters the stage of menopause, she will still experience the symptoms of PCOS and, in addition, menopausal symptoms.1,2 It can be more difficult to determine symptoms of perimenopause and menopause if you have PCOS, especially if one has a history of irregular periods.
Although it is not completely understood, menses of patients with PCOS may become more regular as they age. There is a gap in research, however, about menstrual cycles during the transition phase in patients with PCOS. Females with PCOS have a decline in estrogen levels and tend to reach menopause an average of 2 years later than those who are not affected.3
Hyperandrogenism may persist with PCOS during menopause.1-2 As a female ages, serum androgen levels may increase as estrogen levels decline, leading to non-PCOS patients to experience hirsutism. However, it has been found that serum androgen, free androgen, and total testosterone levels remain or continue to increase in those with PCOS compared with healthy females. At the same time, estrogen levels continue to decline in both women with PCOS and those without PCOS. These increased serum androgen levels are elevated in some women with the syndrome until the age of 70 and decrease to a normal range into her 80s. As a female becomes more androgenic, symptoms worsen, and comorbidities worsen.1-3
There are baseline concerns that women with PCOS are at increased risk for hypertension, hypercholesteremia, heart disease, increased body mass index (BMI), and diabetes mellitus (DM) during this stage of life. Although more research is needed, there is concern that after menopause a female with PCOS has twice the rate of developing coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular accidents, and or myocardial infarctions than women without PCOS, putting them at higher risks of increased mortality secondary to these comorbidities and or events.1-3
Inflammatory markers and metabolic variables at baseline worsen with age. However, with these markers elevated in women, this puts women with PCOS at an even higher risk of life-long health concerns beyond menopause.3
There is no cure for polycystic ovarian syndrome. Women with PCOS may experience menarche at an earlier age and transition to menopause at a later age, almost 2 years later, than those without PCOS. The syndrome is difficult to diagnose when a woman is in menopause because some of the cardinal symptoms of PCOS may subside at this time of life. Healthy lifestyle factors are an important key in improving or eliminating symptoms of PCOS, but also symptoms of perimenopause and menopause.
Awareness of PCOS is about recognizing the disease and encouraging healthy living, which impacts the quality of life and longevity of women. Early diagnosis has the potential to encourage young women to seek medical advice early and prevent long-term complications. In addition, improving awareness and understanding of the syndrome is regarded as a crucial first step in the management of the syndrome.4
It has been shown that delayed diagnosis is commonly associated with poor patient experiences in females with PCOS worldwide. There are clear opportunities for enhancing awareness among women and health care providers to improve timely diagnosis.5 The primary health concern of females is excess weight, emphasizing the need to address lifestyle and weight management for all ages with PCOS.5
Overall, when a female is pursuing help from her health care provider, she is looking for information and support across a range of modalities. In turn, health care providers need to enhance their knowledge to be comfortable with early detection and recognition, diagnosing, and beginning treatment for a female with PCOS.
Whether diagnosed in adolescence or adulthood, health care providers need to know the person with PCOS; know what they are experiencing and truly hear their concerns about their health and life; then, we will treat the syndrome and comorbidity. Doing this for a female, especially beginning in the adolescent age with PCOS, sets her up for health maintenance at whatever stage of life she is in. Following her in her journey down the Yellow Brick Road will change her experience with health care professionals, the treatment of PCOS, and living with the syndrome immensely.
Health care in the United States needs to continue developing up-to-date evidence-based guidelines, design health professional resources, design patient resources, and disseminate that information to improve a female’s experience from diagnosis through life.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/fasting-and-diabetes/,Fasting and Diabetes: Understanding the Latest Guidelines,"Fasting has been an integral part of religious practices for thousands of years. Considering the renewed interest in fasting for weight loss and other health benefits, patients with diabetes may be curious about fasting to enhance their health or maintain their cultural traditions.
Despite potential benefits, fasting with diabetes comes with a heightened risk for certain complications, particularly when patients undergo longer-term fasts, take multiple medications, or have additional health concerns.1 Striking the balance between respect for your patients’ belief systems and keeping them safe can thus be challenging.
To navigate this tenuous topic, we spoke with Nuha El Sayed, MD, MMSc. Dr Sayed is the Senior Vice President of Health Care Improvement. She worked closely on updating the American Diabetes Association’s Standards of Care in diabetes.
Dr Sayed explains that fasting is possible for some people with diabetes. Nonetheless, she still prefers to take a cautious approach. “I have scores of people with diabetes who are considered low risk for fasting who fast successfully…I also have many people who may be at higher risk for fasting who insist on fasting for religious or other reasons, but we agree on safety parameters to break their fast.”
Here’s what you should know about applying the latest guidelines and best practices to your patients.
Diabetes practitioners may be hesitant to condone fasting methods that interrupt a patient’s current diabetes care plan. However, some patients stand to benefit from fasting, and it shouldn’t be discounted before weighing the pros and cons.2
Since weight loss is a goal for many diabetes patients, finding effective strategies that patients are willing and able to try can be an essential aspect of diabetes management. Intermittent fasting is a weight loss strategy that includes structured fasting and “feasting” periods. There are a few different popular protocols for intermittent fasting, such as:
Study findings show that intermittent fasting is a simplistic and practical approach that promotes similar weight loss results as seen with traditional calorie restriction (3-8% from starting weight). Intermittent fasting is also generally considered safe for those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, patients on insulin or secretagogues may require medical monitoring during the fasting window.1
Furthermore, a growing body of evidence supports intermittent fasting for a wide range of health benefits related to heart health, inflammation, and immune regulation.3
Fasting can also offer mental and emotional health benefits. Findings from studies on religious fasting have shown a greater sense of community, self-acceptance, and reductions in feelings of anxiety and depression during the fasting period.2 Some patients may feel fasting facilitates a deeper connection between their body and mind by emphasizing their awareness and focus on eating mindfully and breaking away from unhealthy food habits.
Because fasting for religious or other reasons is not uncommon, Dr Sayed says that it’s vital for health care professionals, including Registered Dietitian Nutritionists, certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialists, and others, to inquire about fasting practices among people with diabetes.
Dr Sayed advises providers to be mindful of the increased risk for hypoglycemia, dehydration, hyperglycemia, and ketoacidosis among people with diabetes who fast. She feels that there’s a need to provide education and support to accommodate individuals’ choices about religious fasting, including advice on glucose monitoring, medication and fluid adjustments, timing and intensity of physical activity, and meal choices pre- and post-fast.
Fortunately, some specific recommendations are already available for certain fasting periods, including Yom Kippur and Ramadan.2,4 These guidelines suggest ways to modify blood glucose monitoring and antidiabetic medications.
For example, studies on Ramadan suggest that glucose-dependent diabetes drugs — metformin, acarbose, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors — aren’t as likely to cause hypoglycemia during fasting. As a result, there’s usually less need for adjustment while fasting.
Normal dosing of short-acting insulin secretagogues is also considered safe when administered during mealtimes. However, modern sulfonylureas may increase the risk for hypoglycemia. In addition, there are some concerns about dehydration with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, particularly since no water intake is permitted from sunrise to sundown during Ramadan fasts.2
Ideally, continuous or at least more frequent blood glucose monitoring during fasts can help increase patient awareness and self-efficacy. Patients should be advised that checking blood sugar does not constitute a break in the fast.
No two diabetes patients are exactly alike; some can fast more safely than others. Most religions allow fasting exceptions for those who are unwell or not fit for fasting, but devout followers may be reluctant to excuse themselves from the practice.2 For instance, although pregnancy is a contraindication for fasting, this recommendation may be ignored when there is religious or community pressure to fast regardless.
Patients older than 65 years of age have a greater likelihood of comorbidities that may complicate fasting, including cardiovascular disease, impaired kidney function, and dementia. They may also take multiple medications that affect their glucose control.2 Additionally, in some cases, the fasting periods also affect sleep, physical activity, and other habits that influence metabolism.2 Rating systems to help determine if a patient is at risk or safe to fast can be helpful and provide an objective way to explain the reasoning behind your recommendations.2
Dr Sayed recommends the following culturally sensitive steps when counseling diabetes patients on fasting:
Dr Sayed takes a similar approach with all patients, whether they do short-term fasting for religious reasons or weight loss. However, she says longer fasts warrant a deeper discussion.
“With prolonged fasting, my initial step is to understand the motivation behind a person with diabetes wanting to undertake such an approach,” she shares. “Given that usually safer alternatives [for weight loss] are available, I collaborate with the individual to develop a more medically safe alternative to meet their objectives.”
She goes on to explain, “Considering the potential risks, I generally advise against prolonged fasting for most people with diabetes. If a person insists on a prolonged fast against medical advice, strict and close medical supervision is recommended.”
Ultimately, patient care is a collaborative effort built on trust and respect. While providers often have legitimate concerns about their patients’ lifestyle choices, teamwork is always more effective. Take the time to understand your patients’ motivating factors before expressing concern or giving directives. Establishing a strong foundation paves the way to reaching common ground.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/pcos-cardiovascular-disease/,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Cardiovascular Disease,"This is the fifth installment of a 6-part series on the lifelong journey of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the stops along the way that a female may face. In this installment, I will discuss PCOS and cardiovascular disease.
Continuing the journey with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), the multitude of health comorbidities that can occur all play a major role in the stress on a patient’s cardiovascular system. There is a very high prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance with PCOS. As a result, a female is at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), along with dyslipidemia and hypertension, possibly leading to heart disease.1
It has been found that women with PCOS have a heart disease risk factor profile similar to men’s. This is due to the possible risk factors of hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and anovulation. Chronic anovulation in association with clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism resulting in male pattern characteristics of hypertension, hypercholesteremia, increased body mass index (BMI), and hirsutism, possibly causing thinning of hair or male patterned baldness, increased testosterone levels, and increased androsterone levels. Research shows that a female with PCOS is twice as likely to have a cardiovascular event of a myocardial infarction or cerebral cardiovascular accident than patients without PCOS.1-3
Cardiovascular complications often go undetected and can be a silent killer in women because symptoms can be non-specific and different than in men. Women don’t often experience chest pain or other classic symptoms, or they may experience more subtle symptoms than male patients. When a female patient does seek help, it has been found that health care providers can sometimes downplay their symptoms, or misattribute cardiac symptoms to gastrointestinal reflux or anxiety.1,2
Research suggests that PCOS can accelerate the development of increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.1 This can occur at any age group, and not just premenopausal or menopausal, as would be the normal time of presentation in a female patient without PCOS. Increased risk of cardiovascular disease has also been found to be more prevalent in premenopausal women with PCOS.1 One gap in research for potential future studies is to identify the risk of cardiovascular events in females with PCOS. There would be a significant benefit from extensive and clear hallmark phenotyping of PCOS abnormalities.
The many complications of PCOS discussed in this series, including metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and atherosclerosis, are the main contributing factors that put a patient at high risk of cardiovascular disease and complications.1-3
Metabolic syndrome is a complication and a condition distinguished by excess abdominal visceral fat, insulin resistance, hypertension, and abnormal cholesterol levels or atherosclerosis. Metabolic syndrome has a significant negative health impact and is one of the many complications of having PCOS. It is also one of the major contributing factors to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Women with PCOS and metabolic syndrome are twice as likely to develop cardiovascular disease or related complications and have increased mortality at younger ages than those without the syndrome.1-3
Hypertension is considered a silent medical condition because many individuals are not aware they have it. This is when the heart is pumping harder to circulate the blood throughout the body.1-3 Studies show that females with PCOS had increased blood pressure (24%) in comparison to females living without PCOS. Stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system causes hypertension in patients diagnosed with PCOS. Furthermore, an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system increases renal sodium reabsorption, and a reduction in the synthesis of nitric oxide have all been linked to the onset of hypertension in patients with PCOS.2
A patient with PCOS is at risk for unhealthy cholesterol levels: increased triglycerides, increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, increased total cholesterol, and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which contributes to atherosclerosis.1-3
Females with PCOS are at higher risk of developing atherosclerosis; however, lifestyle changes may not be enough to reduce their risk because hormonal dysregulation plays a major role in this process of PCOS. Research has shown that in female patients with PCOS, both those with and without obesity, can develop atherosclerosis because insulin resistance is a factor in their hormonal environment. Patients with PCOS are the group of women most likely to develop earlier onset cardiovascular disease when compared to those without the syndrome.1,2
We need to better understand and continue researching the relationship between the effects on the cardiovascular system and cardiovascular disease in women diagnosed with PCOS. For all patients, we should encourage healthy nutrition and regular exercise. In health care, we want to identify anyone at higher risk of developing cardiovascular complications and instill healthy lifestyle practices. However, the approach needs to be more proactive in patients with PCOS, and providers need to work with each individual to continue reaching the goal of health maintenance, blood pressure monitoring, and continued cardiovascular follow-up as she grows older.1-3

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-infertility/,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Infertility,"This is the fourth installment of a 6-part series on the lifelong journey of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the stops a patient may face along the way. In this installment, Danielle R. Stratton, DNP, RN, PPCNP-BC, will discuss PCOS and infertility.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infertility in females. This does not mean that it is impossible for a patient with PCOS to become pregnant. Some female patients with PCOS have more difficulty with infertility than others. For those experiencing infertility, the process is an individualized plan of care.1,2
PCOS symptoms manifest in early adolescence and can continue into young adulthood and throughout life. An abnormal menstrual pattern may be of little concern to most females and their health care providers. However, starting in adolescence, the main clinical problem is the control of amenorrhea or menstrual irregularity and hirsutism, the most common clinical manifestations and complaints from patients in this age group. Oligo-anovulation in the adolescent age, if persistent, is a significant matter of concern. Hirsutism and moderate to severe acne should be considered a clinical manifestation of hyperandrogenism (HA), which leads to a high risk of infertility. If we begin to treat the whole individual and the syndrome beginning in adolescence, we will set them up for a healthier future.1,2
Infertility rates among patients with PCOS are high. In one study, 90% to 95% of anovulatory women seeking treatment for infertility had PCOS.3 The syndrome involves hormonal imbalances, insulin resistance, and metabolic abnormalities that markedly increase the risk of infertility, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.4
As we continue on this journey, we see that the relationship between PCOS and insulin resistance affects more than just the development of obesity and diabetes. Insulin is a critical hormone in females of reproductive age. It is key to the action of the central nervous system in ovulation. Insulin resistance contributes to the production of smaller eggs and the delayed production of eggs.5
In a female without PCOS, a normal menstrual cycle produces a follicle that is mature and ready to ovulate for fertilization, which is between 18mm and 28mm in diameter. Many females without PCOS may not ovulate for other reasons, and may not have regular menstrual periods. However, the difference between a normal and polycystic ovary is that the polycystic ovary contains many small cystic follicles that are between 2mm and 9mm in diameter, which may not ovulate regularly.6
Women with PCOS have excess amounts of the hormones testosterone and androstenedione, resulting in higher testosterone levels in the blood. Also, when a patient’s ovaries do not produce properly matured follicles, there is no ovulation or ovulation of an immature follicle, resulting in the inability of the egg to be fertilized.6 Most women with PCOS have elevated levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and reduced levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). When you couple all of this with elevated androgens and insulin, infrequent or absent menstruation is the result.4
A woman with PCOS more often than not will have difficulty getting pregnant and will require treatment to increase and improve her chances for pregnancy. This process includes the need for ovulatory induction.4,6
Treatment options for fertility with PCOS can be used alone or in combination or stepwise, with one stage leading to the next, if any stage of treatment is ineffective.
These options include:
A review article by Katyal et al suggests that vitamin D and inositol, a sugar made in the body and available as supplements such as myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol, may also be effective therapeutic options for patients with infertility and PCOS.8 “Vitamin D influences ovarian follicular development, glucose regulation, and insulin sensitivity. When combined with metformin therapy, it is associated with improved menstrual regularity and ovulation. Inositol is crucial for cellular signaling, energy metabolism, glucose regulation, and fertility. This systematic review underscores the importance of investigating inositoland vitamin D within a PCOS management strategy, given the disorder’s prevalence and impacts on fertility and metabolic health,” wrote the authors.
The challenge of infertility and the decision to go through the process of fertility treatment can place physiologic stress on a patient’s body as well as being emotionally and mentally exhausting. These stressors on the body can contribute negatively to a patient’s well-being and add to the multitude of chronic stressors a patient with PCOS is already dealing with.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/biden-administrations-negotiated-price-cuts-for-10-common-prescription-drugs/,Biden Administration’s Negotiated Price Cuts for 10 Common Prescription Drugs,"The Conversation — The Biden administration announced the reduced prices of the first 10 drugs it has negotiated with pharmaceutical companies over their Medicare prices.
Provisions authorizing these negotiations were part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which took effect in 2022, but these lower prices aren’t scheduled to take effect until 2026.
The drugs are purchased through Medicare Part D, a prescription drug coverage program for Americans who are 65 and older. The 10 medications were used by 9 million patients with Medicare coverage in 2023, and they accounted for US $56.2 billion in total Medicare spending. Had the negotiated prices been in place that year, the government estimates that Medicare would have saved about $6 billion.
To put this in perspective: Total annual spending on prescription drugs in the US exceeds $405 billion, and Part D alone spends more than $215 billion.
As a scholar who researches the politics of health policy, I remain skeptical that negotiations will end up having a substantial impact on the US health care system in the foreseeable future, even if the law survives ongoing legal and implementation challenges.
At the same time, I do expect that many older adults will reap substantial savings on their out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs over the coming years. But that will primarily happen due to other Inflation Reduction Act provisions.
The Inflation Reduction Act allows the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to negotiate prices with the companies that make some of the most expensive drugs in the Medicare program, including life-saving cancer and diabetes treatments like Imbruvica and Januvia.
Democrats have hailed these drug pricing provisions as game-changing. Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now running for president, is making efforts to rein in drug prices part of her election campaign.
Former President Donald Trump, however, has been relatively quiet on the issue. Public opinion polls show overwhelming public support for the policy.
Medicare will soon begin to negotiate prices for more drugs, including 30 over the next 2 years.
If the policy continues to move forward as planned, the drug price negotiation provision is expected to save the US government about $98.5 billion by 2031.
The Biden administration hopes that some of these cost savings will be passed down to Americans 65 and older through reduced Medicare Part D premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs. The White House also hopes to reduce the federal deficit by $237 billion.
While negotiations over Medicare drug prices have received the most attention, the Inflation Reduction Act included other provisions that might be even more beneficial for older adults.
These include limiting out-of-pocket spending by older adults on prescription drugs to no more than $2000 annually by 2025, limiting the growth of Medicare Part D premiums, providing rebates if certain drug price increases outpace inflation, eliminating out-of-pocket costs for vaccines and providing premium subsidies to low-income people 65 years and older.
Despite their vocal opposition and their ongoing public relations campaign that has attacked this process, all affected US drugmakers decided to engage in the price negotiations.
The daunting alternatives, including paying a penalty that could run as high as 95% of their US pharmaceutical product sales, and a requirement to pull their drugs from the Medicare and Medicaid markets, proved to be strong incentives.
However, the manufacturers of medications have been fighting the measure in court. And despite several losses, this battle will likely continue for the foreseeable future, with uncertain outcomes.
Americans pay substantially more for prescription drugs compared with people who live in countries with similar economies. For example, per capita pharmaceutical spending in the US amounted to $1432 compared to $1042 in Germany and $766 in France in 2022.
The reasons for this disparity are multilayered and include the overall complexity of the US health care system and the lack of transparency in the drug supply chain. Of course, many other countries also directly set prices for drugs or use their monopoly over health services to drive down costs.
Drug costs impose a big burden on Americans. People who are 65 and older are particularly affected, with 1 in 5 not taking all of their medications as prescribed due to high costs.
In my view, the government’s efforts are a step in the right direction. The potential for real savings for Americans 65 and older will undoubtedly grow as more drug prices are negotiated.
Yet, some real concerns remain.
Even if the negotiated lower prices survive the industry’s legal challenges, it’s possible that future Republican administrations won’t embrace this policy, as Republicans have historically opposed price negotiations for Medicare.
The true effect for patients with Medicare will likely be much smaller than it appears. That’s because the Medicare program and patients often already receive discounts on many of these drugs. These discounts will now be eliminated.
In addition, the pharmaceutical industry has a history of skillfully exploiting loopholes that may further limit the financial impact. Manufacturers have already told shareholders that they expect limited impacts on their profits.
It’s also too soon to tell if this is going to be a win for all Americans. It’s possible that Americans who aren’t covered by Medicare may actually see prices go up, even on these same drugs. Working Americans could thus wind up shouldering ever larger burdens to deliver this support for older adults.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/pcos-insulin-resistance-diabetes-mellitus/,Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: Insulin Resistance and Diabetes Mellitus,"This is the third installment of a 6-part series on the lifelong journey of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and the stops along the way that a female may face. In this installment, Danielle R. Stratton, DNP, RN, PPCNP-BC, will discuss insulin resistance and diabetes and the significant impact it can have on a female with the syndrome on her health and the impact on her entire body systems, and her health’s future as we continue with this series.
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder impacting women of reproductive age. The etiology of obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome is not fully understood.1 However, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus (DM) play a role in the development of extra intrabdominal adipose tissue throughout a female’s span of life.2 As an endocrine disorder, PCOS is linked with persistent insulin resistance over time leading to metabolic complications. This leads to a vicious cycle of developing further multisystem concerns, especially in a patient of reproductive age.
Insulin resistance is prevalent in females with PCOS independently of obesity; in patients with obesity,1 it is amplified. Insulin resistance is an inadequate response to the hormone insulin, which means the body makes the insulin but cannot use it effectively. This puts the patient at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.3 This is a critical component involved in metabolic and reproductive health issues associated with PCOS, and one of the difficulties in management.1
Females with obesity are at risk of developing insulin resistance, however, women with PCOS are at higher risk. With the development of insulin resistance, the pancreas still secretes insulin but the body ceases to store glucose properly. Glucose will then continue to accumulate in the blood and gradually change the body’s response to glucose. This results in hyperglycemia, and with worsening insulin resistance, leads to diabetes mellitus.1-3
Insulin resistance has been found in adolescents with PCOS, however, health care providers are not always testing and monitoring for this early in a female’s life. Adolescent females with PCOS are at risk of developing glucose intolerance, leading to insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Approximately 10% of females with PCOS will be found to have type 2 diabetes by the age of 40.2
Patients with a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes are particularly at higher risk. Females with PCOS and a family history of type 2 diabetes may have a combination of insulin resistance and an impairment in insulin secretions. However, the extent of insulin resistance one may have does not predict the therapeutic response to insulin-lowering treatments.4
The relationship between PCOS and insulin resistance has been widely studied. Insulin is a pivotal hormone in females of reproductive age. The action of insulin in the central nervous system (CNS) is imperative for ovulation. Insulin resistance contributes to the production of smaller eggs and/or the delayed production of eggs.3 Other clinical manifestations of insulin resistance that a female with PCOS may develop include hyperlipidemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, hepatic disease, renal disease, acanthosis nigricans, and sleep disorders.2
A majority of women and adolescent girls with PCOS have insulin resistance and consequently hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia has a major negative effect on the physiology of the body, but also on the metabolic and reproductive health, especially in women with PCOS. The evidence in the literature supports that every effort should be taken to reduce hyperinsulinemia and its impact before and during puberty in females with hyperandrogenemia. Furthermore, health care providers need to take the lead and treat adult females with PCOS more aggressively.1-5
It is important to note that not all females with PCOS have insulin resistance and/or develop diabetes mellitus. This is one reason why PCOS is not fully understood. Despite being a common development, not every woman develops every sign or symptom of PCOS — it is not a cookie cutter syndrome, and not every sign and symptom affects each female in the same way. Because of this, routine assessment of insulin resistance is not recommended. There is no validated test currently in medicine to measure insulin resistance, as a result, it is not necessary to definitively make the diagnosis of PCOS or to select the individualized treatment(s).4-5
A patient with PCOS cannot control all the factors that increase their risk of developing insulin resistance, however, they ensure they are active and exercising regularly, they have healthy nutrition habits, and they are managing stress.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/recurrent-pericarditis-aha-initiative/,AHA Initiative Aims to Improve Care in Recurrent Pericarditis,"For the estimated 40,000 adults with recurrent pericarditis in the United States, a new initiative announced by the American Heart Association (AHA) may lead to better outcomes by reducing treatment barriers for patients and educating providers about current science and best practices in pericarditis management.1
Following an initial episode of acute pericarditis, up to 30% of patients will experience at least 1 recurrence, and approximately one-half of these individuals will have additional flares.2 Common treatments for pericarditis include aspirin or other NSAIDs, colchicine, and corticosteroids. Immunosuppressive agents and pericardiectomy may be used in refractory cases of recurrent pericarditis.3
Compared with patients who experience a single episode of pericarditis, those with recurrent disease are more likely to experience complications such as pericardial effusion or tamponade.4 Due to the painful, unpredictable nature of the disease, recurrent pericarditis is also associated with reduced quality of life and significant disability. In a study of 83 patients, 50% reported work impairment and 62% reported activity impairment due to recurrent episodes.5,6
Noting that recurrent pericarditis often goes undiagnosed and untreated, the AHA recently announced a 3-year plan to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life in this patient population.1 The Addressing Recurrent Pericarditis initiative will reportedly address barriers in pericarditis care, educate health care providers, and develop tailored educational resources for patients.1 The initiative, sponsored by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, will be implemented at 15 regional health care sites across the United States.
Cardiology Advisor interviewed AHA volunteer Jimmy Kerrigan, MD, cardiologist at Ascension Saint Thomas in Nashville, Tennessee, to discuss the goals of the new initiative and the importance of accurate diagnosis and treatment in recurrent pericarditis.
Dr Kerrigan: Pericarditis in general can be difficult to diagnose. While some people have standard symptoms, such as chest pain that worsens in certain positions or with deep breathing, along with specific findings on laboratory testing and an ECG, others may not have these symptoms. Especially for patients who have had pericarditis before, what they may feel with later episodes may be different than the first time around.
With recurrent pericarditis, most people still have chest pain, and many also feel tired, short of breath, or are unable to exercise as much as they normally can. Because so many different conditions can cause these types of symptoms, pericarditis may not be the first thought that comes to mind when trying to figure out what is wrong with our patients so that we can help them feel better.
Pericarditis can be tricky to figure out. It’s important to make the right diagnosis, because if we don’t, it’s almost impossible for patients to get the right treatment. That’s one of the reasons the Addressing Recurrent Pericarditis initiative started—to help teach doctors and other health care professionals when to think about pericarditis and how to treat it best.
Dr Kerrigan: Here’s the thing about recurrent pericarditis: A lot of health care professionals don’t even know about it. When a patient goes to their primary provider or the emergency room, pericarditis might not be on their radar, which means it can take a long time to get a diagnosis. And even if they are diagnosed, finding the right specialist for treatment can be difficult.
Treatments have changed a lot recently, and what doctors did just a few years ago might now be considered harmful to patients, which is another reason why we are working on this initiative—to educate health care professionals about recurrent pericarditis and ensure they know how to use the right diagnosis and treatment methods.3,7 We’re doing that through implementation science, which takes the best ideas for identifying and treating recurrent pericarditis and gives tools to put them into practice in various systems of care so that patients can get the needed care.
Dr Kerrigan: The main gaps we need to address are teaching people how to spot recurrent pericarditis, even when it doesn’t cause the usual symptoms, and how to treat it once it’s diagnosed, so that it doesn’t get worse. If not treated right, recurrent pericarditis can lead to a more serious condition called constrictive pericarditis, which can require heart surgery to fix.
The places that are taking part in this project will help make educational tools to fill in these gaps. Once we have those tools, we’ll use them to teach clinicians the best ways to identify and treat patients with recurrent pericarditis. This education will be both online and in person. We also want to make “digital toolkits” that health care professionals and systems can use to make it easier to find and treat patients. We’ll use every way we can to make sure that patients get the best care possible.
Dr Kerrigan: Be vigilant. When patients present with symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath, especially if they have a history of pericarditis, even if remote, we hope that health care providers will think about recurrent pericarditis and arrange for the appropriate testing to get the right diagnosis. Additionally, remain up to date with the treatment of pericarditis with regards to best practices for both the acute instance and recurrences in order to help prevent future harm. Otherwise, pay attention to updates as they come out, both from this working group and other bodies tasked with improving care for pericarditis patients.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-obesity/,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Obesity,"This is the second installment of a 6-part series on the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In this installment, Danielle R. Stratton, DNP, RN, PPCNP-BC, discusses obesity and the significant impact it can have on patients with PCOS. This is a condition that most females with PCOS battle from adolescence through end of life.
The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) heralds significant changes in a woman’s life trajectory. Women with PCOS often express heightened concerns regarding their weight, yet they frequently lack clarity in assessing and appreciating their overall health and lifestyle choices. Therefore, health care providers must educate each woman upon diagnosis, emphasizing that this syndrome does not define their identity.1
Health providers need to empower each patient with PCOS to:
Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common obesity-related endocrine syndrome in females,2 and obesity is a major concern for those with PCOS. Although the etiology of obesity is not fully known, it is estimated that half of females with PCOS are considered obese (defined as a BMI ≥30 kg/mg2). For those females that are in the nonobese category, approximately one-third have a concern about intra-abdominal adipose tissue, also known as visceral fat. Visceral fat accumulation is a major health concern for everyone, not only females with PCOS, because over time it can cause a multitude of health complications that impact different body systems.2-7 A high level of visceral fat is associated with insulin resistance.8
Women with PCOS tend to have a higher body mass index (BMI) than patients without PCOS and have difficulty losing weight as they get older. This begins a cycle of the continuous effect of insulin resistance leading to type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), sleep apnea, hypertension, heart disease, risk for cerebrovascular accidents, hypercholesterolemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, poor immune function, stress, depression, and anxiety.9
Studies have shown that androgens play a key role in the determination of body fat distribution. Anatomically and physiologically, it is known that males have a greater distribution of visceral fat in the upper portion of the body compared to females, who tend to accumulate fat in the lower body. A female with PCOS has hyperandrogenism and increased testosterone levels.10 Hyperandrogenism can induce multiple symptoms of PCOS, including obesity, androgenic alopecia, hirsutism, and acne.11
The accumulation of visceral fat from adolescence into adulthood is a defining symptom of PCOS.8 The chronic exposure to higher levels of androgens in females with PCOS modifies body fat accumulation and distribution, leading to increased visceral fat. This, in turn, adversely impacts insulin sensitivity, resulting in insulin resistance, contributing to the gain of more visceral fat, overall weight gain and ultimately obesity.10 The combination of insulin resistance and obesity exacerbates symptoms of hyperandrogenism, creating a vicious cycle for a female with PCOS and increasing the symptoms she may experience in her life.11
Early-onset treatment of PCOS is crucial in reducing the patient’s risk of developing these system-wide complications. A holistic treatment approach, addressing comorbidities, should begin as early as possible after diagnosis of PCOS, particularly in adolescents or young adults with obesity. Although progress has been made in the study of PCOS, further research is needed. Adolescents and young adults with PCOS and obesity require more attention from health care providers and researchers to improve their quality of life today and into the future.5-7
Management of obesity is the same as for those with and without PCOS, beginning with healthy lifestyle changes focused on nutrition and increasing daily activity. A recent meta-analysis of 19 randomized control trials that included 727 patients with PCOS found that the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) was the most effective in reducing insulin resistance, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin levels, and triglyceride levels in women with PCOS. For reducing BMI, the most effective intervention was a low-calorie diet, and for weight loss, the low-calorie diet with metformin was the most effective. In a comparison of a normal diet (55% carbohydrate, 15% to 20% protein, and 25% to 30% fat) vs metformin, metformin produced the greatest reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total testosterone levels and the normal diet ranked first for increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.12
Supplementation with probiotics, vitamin D, and L-carnitine has provided additional benefits to patients.13-16 The coadministration of a probiotic and vitamin D for 12 weeks has been shown to have beneficial effects on the mental health of patients with PCOS, as well as reducing hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress on the body.13 Vitamin and supplements assist in synthesizing serotonin levels, increase the function of neurons to release dopamine, release antioxidants that decrease serum total testosterone levels, and decrease oxidative stress.14 The literature suggests that supplementation, specifically with probiotics, should be considered in adolescents with PCOS. A literature review found an improvement in weight, BMI, insulin, and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), indicating the potential role of probiotics to protect fertility.15
It is well established that providing the body with sufficient nutrients contributes to energy, cell growth, lipid metabolism, reproduction, and overall health. In the body of someone with PCOS, several nutrients have been shown to play a role in overall health and regulate pathways and synthesis, and may help to counteract complications of PCOS.13-16
The next stage of weight management involves individualized pharmacotherapy. The current treatment for obesity in patients with PCOS includes glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) (Table). In conjunction with a low-calorie diet, GLP-1 receptor agonists have demonstrated substantial weight loss (6%-11%).17 These agents mimic the effects of the GLP-1 hormone that is secreted from L-cells, which are located in the distal portion of the small intestine. This hormone causes a decrease in the release of glucagon, suppressing the hypothalamic hunger center and slowing gastric emptying. This leads to early satiety, which affects the release of insulin by increasing postprandial glucose levels. As a result, GLP-1 agonists have been shown to reduce energy intake by suppressing appetite.18
Research has found that GLP-1 immunoreactivity in the neurons of the myenteric and submucosal plexuses within the duodenum and proximal colon regulates motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Further, neuronal GLP-1 was also found to be located within the brain, mimicking the anorexic effect when one is given a GLP-1 agonist(s), leading in turn to potential weight loss.18
Although these GLP-1 agonists have been shown to cause weight loss, health insurance may not cover their use without a diagnosis of DM. All of the GLP-1 agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide, tirzepatide) can all be used to treat DM and research has shown them to be effective in combination with metformin in treating PCOS, with the added benefit of weight loss.18,19
For patients with significant weight gain, recommendations for bariatric surgery to assist in weight loss should be considered.9 In a study by Machado Júnior et al of the effects of sleeve gastrectomy on the hormonal profile of patients with PCOS, the authors found that plasma estradiol levels were higher (preoperative mean of 63.4 pg/dL vs postoperative mean of 91.0 pg/dL), and mean fasting insulin levels were significantly lower (24.4 mIU/mL vs.9.0 mIU/mL; P <0.001) at 3 months after surgery. In addition, luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were lower (7.2 vs. 4.5; P =0.047) and an inverted LH/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio was seen at 3 months (1.5 vs. 0.9; P =0.008). The patients also had significant weight loss (mean BMI, 40.5 kg/m2 vs. 33.4 kg/m2; P <0.001).20
Integrating proactive screening for hyperandrogenism and obesity into the standard protocol for managing patients with PCOS is paramount for comprehensive care. Empowering women early after their diagnoses to be proactive about their health is critical. With an array of weight loss options available, ranging from lifestyle changes to medical interventions, individuals with PCOS have avenues to improve health outcomes. By prioritizing early intervention and personalized treatment strategies, health care providers can significantly enhance the quality of life for women with PCOS.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-psychosocial-effects/,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Psychosocial Effects,"This is the first installment of a 6-part series on the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In this installment, Danielle R. Stratton, DNP, RN, PPCNP-BC, will discuss the basics of the syndrome and the psychosocial impact it can have from diagnosis to later life.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a diverse, chronic, complex, incurable, under-detected, female endocrine disorder that, over time, can cause a multitude of health complications impacting different body systems. The journey a person takes from prior to and after diagnosis is like Dorothy’s journey along the Yellow Brick Road.1
Because PCOS often goes undiagnosed, it is crucial that health care providers, especially pediatric health professionals, are educated on how to identify an adolescent female at risk for PCOS, diagnose and implement treatment, and introduce interventions to promote maintenance of health. Delayed diagnosis of PCOS is commonly associated with poor patient experiences, which follow them into adulthood.2-7 By improving awareness, one can improve the diagnostic experience, education, management, and health outcomes for young patients.
The syndrome was initially named Stein-Leventhal Syndrome, after the late American gynecologists Irving F. Stein, Sr, and Michael Leo Leventhal, who first associated anovulation with the presence of ovarian cysts in 1935.8 There is some evidence that PCOS was first reported in the 1700s when an Italian scientist, Antonio Vallisneri, described an infertile married female with shiny ovaries, with a white surface, and the size and look of pigeon eggs.9
In 1935, Stein and Leventhal described a similar condition in a group of 7 women who also exhibited hirsutism, menstruation irregularities, and enlarged ovaries with multiple small follicles on the surface. Their original report mentioned that abnormalities in the stimulation of hormones result in bilateral cystic ovaries.8
For many years the presence of ovarian cysts with anovulation was the diagnostic criteria for what was known as Stein-Leventhal Syndrome. Research in the 1980s, however, began system wide components of the disease, including endocrinologic, adrenal, and ovarian hyperandrogenic; metabolic, and psychological components that evolved as qualifications of the syndrome.9
In the early 1990s, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) began to sponsor educational medical conferences on what was now known as PCOS, which pioneered the formal diagnostic criteria leading to the recognition of the syndrome across medical diagnoses. Stein-Leventhal Syndrome and PCOS were used interchangeable until the name officially changed to PCOS by 2004.9
Researchers now know that PCOS is a complex hormonal condition with genetic and environmental causes that is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with a high prevalence of PCOS and metabolic syndrome seen in a family history.2-4 The syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation.7 It is one of the most common endocrine metabolic reproductive disorders, affecting 8% to 13% of women of reproductive age.10 Approximately 6 million women in the United States are affected by PCOS. The condition, however, remains undiagnosed in up to 70% of women worldwide.10 It often manifests during adolescence and is associated with disruptions in health-related quality of life.6 The condition results in enlarged ovaries with small cysts on the outer edges and is the primary cause of anovulatory female infertility associated with an imbalance in female sex hormones.4,9
Patients usually present with abnormally high androgen levels, which is an important component of putting the PCOS puzzle together.11 High androgen levels have a major impact on reproductive health and are the leading source of infertility in women in their childbearing years.12 The prevalence of PCOS has increased almost 65% over the last decade. It is unclear if this is in relation to the syndrome itself, or if health care providers are more aware of the signs and symptoms of PCOS, leading to further investigation and diagnosis. Therefore, a convenient but consistent diagnostic criteria algorithm is necessary to assist in accurate diagnosis worldwide.13
With the prevalence of PCOS increasing, providers need to recognize symptoms and promptly begin treatment to reduce associated comorbidities.12 Early diagnosis and intervention for adolescents with PCOS can change the clinical course and quality of life for patients living with this condition.2

There is no single test to confirm a diagnosis of PCOS, making diagnosis challenging.7 Even before a definitive diagnosis of PCOS, females with clinical signs of androgen excess, oligomenorrhea, and amenorrhea can be regarded as being at risk for PCOS.
This is a complex disorder involving multiple organ systems with onset during the early pubertal years.7 It is important to diagnose PCOS as early as possible to limit the potential comorbidities and lifelong complications such as infertility, metabolic syndrome, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, increased cancer risk, and psychosocial dysfunction.2,9 Women with PCOS are also more likely to have anxiety, depression, and mood disorders.12 Timely implementation of individualized therapeutic interventions will improve overall management of PCOS, prevent associated comorbidities, and improve quality of life.5-7,14-16
The experience of diagnosis may have lasting effects on well-being and self-management. Therefore, prompt evaluation and clinical support after diagnosis may prevent associated complications and optimize overall health.5,6 Management of both those at risk for and those with a confirmed diagnosis of PCOS includes education, healthy lifestyle interventions, and therapeutic interventions targeting their symptoms.5-7,14-16 Often the therapeutic interventions are a combination treatment, not only to target the individual symptoms, but to prevent future complications and promote a healthy future.17
A diagnosis of PCOS can have both a positive and negative impact on a patient’s life, impacting their physical and psychosocial well-being. Behavior and lifestyle choices that are made at diagnosis will have an impact on their lifelong health journey.19 Women with PCOS are reported to have more concerns about their weight but less clarity about their overall health and lifestyle choices. This leads to lower self-esteem as well as a 3 times higher incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders compared with those without the diagnosis of PCOS.20 However, it is difficult to determine if anxiety and/or depressive disorders occur before or after the diagnosis of PCOS. Many of the physical features of PCOS (obesity, hirsutism, acne, acanthosis nigricans, male-pattern baldness, and hair thinning) can increase the risk for anxiety and depression. Moreover, underlying hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation, resulting in infertility, also contribute to the impact on mental health.2,4,7,19
Many patients with PCOS experience psychosocial dysfunction, which is defined as “experiencing negative psychosocial effects related to a condition.”19-20 This may result in impaired functioning in their personal and interpersonal relationships at school, home, or work. The understanding of the person who guides the patient through early diagnosis will determine how the patient experiences her individual journey of health down the Yellow Brick Road and can contribute to her positive or negative experiences in the future.
Quality-of-life issues play a role in managing physical health and mental health. Screening for psychological comorbidities is essential and impacts the physical health of a patient with PCOS. Both are crucial and can have a positive or negative impact on quality of life.
PCOS is grossly underdiagnosed despite its prevalence and implications for reproductive, metabolic, and psychological health.16 Being proactive and screening for low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and eating disorders needs to be part of all health care providers’ protocol when caring for a patient with potential or diagnosed PCOS ― from the start and throughout all ages and stages of life.2,9,19

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/childhood-vaccines-updates/,Back to School Means Updating Childhood Vaccines,"The lazy, crazy days of summer are drawing to a close and it is time to start thinking about back to school and all that entails to prepare students to optimize their health. Vaccines can be number one on the list. We need to take a serious look at how the number of children who receive all necessary vaccines for school has dropped since the COVID-19 pandemic began its devastating march around the world.1 The immunization rates are even lower in children who are eligible for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program.2 This federal program provides no-cost vaccines to children who are uninsured or are Medicaid eligible.3 In some states VFC also covers children whose insurance does not cover vaccines. It is time to review what vaccines are indicated to keep all students healthy and practice some infection prevention.
Reminder/recall is one of the best ways to get parents/caregivers to bring children into providers’ offices for that all important review of vaccines.4 Many state immunization registries have functions that can easily generate reminders for parents. States such as New York follow the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practice (ACIP) guidelines for children and adolescents vaccine schedules for school attendance. All providers need to be familiar with the immunization requirements for school attendance in the states in which they practice. This information is easy to access by contacting the state health departments who will have the requirements posted online.
Children entering Pre-K programs vaccination schedules:
Kindergarten requirements include:
Intervals between doses of the Hep B and VAR vaccines are of utmost importance for the vaccines to be effective and intervals should follow the schedules noted for Pre-K children. If the intervals are less than recommended, then additional doses are indicated. Many of the children we will be seeing in preparation for returning to school may be behind schedule. Please consult the CDC’s catch-up schedule for further guidance to ensure that children receive the appropriate vaccines on an accelerated schedule.
Children entering grades 1 through 5 are required to have the same vaccines as indicated for kindergarten except for Hib and PCV, which are not required. Only 3 doses of DTaP/Tdap are indicated for grade 6. Sixth-grade children should have a Tdap booster at ages 11 to 12 years, however, a dose given at age 10 years is acceptable in addition to the other required vaccines. Hib and PCV are also not required for grade 5.5
For grades 7 through 11, the vaccine series required is the same as for grade 6 with the addition of a dose of Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) if they did not receive a dose at age 11 to 12 years.
In addition to the vaccines required for grades 6 through 11, students in grade 12 need an additional dose of MenACWY vaccine administered at age 16 years or older.5
Let’s not forget about the students headed for college. They too should have all of the vaccines recommended for adolescents in grade 12. But college-bound students need to be made aware of the risk of Meningitis B (MenB), including a discussion of the vaccine using shared decision making.5  Meningitis B, while relatively rare, is the only strain of meningitis seen on college campuses in over 10 years.6 There are 2 MenB vaccines, which are NOT interchangeable. If one brand is started, then the series must be completed with the same brand. If the same brand is not available, then the series must be restarted with the other brand.
Bexsero® is a 2-dose series given at 0 and 1 month. Trumenba® is a 2-dose series given at 0 and 6 months. If the second dose is administered earlier than 6 months a third dose must be given at least 4 months after the second dose. CDC has a fact sheet on shared clinical decision making that is very helpful.
Recently a 5-valent Meningitis vaccine was licensed. If a student is receiving MenACWY and MenB vaccines at the same visit, MenABCWY vaccine (Penbraya™) may be given. This vaccine is limited to students aged 16 years and older and it contains Trumenba®. Since there is no interchanging of vaccines all subsequent doses of MenB vaccine must be Trumenba®.
Do not forget the influenza vaccine. The CDC recommends that everyone age 6 months and older receive an influenza vaccine as long as there are no contraindications. It is sobering to note that there were 102 pediatric deaths nationwide as of March 2024. These tragic losses of life were most likely preventable since nearly 90% of cases occurred in unvaccinated children.7 Remember persons with a history of egg allergy of any severity can be vaccinated with any influenza vaccine indicated for the recipient’s age and health status with no additional safety considerations.5
New and improved influenza vaccines are coming according to CDC. One study examining people’s immune response to various influenza vaccines suggests that vaccination with non-egg-based flu vaccines might improve the antibody response to circulating influenza viruses over traditional egg-based vaccines. The findings indicate that repeated vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines could redirect antibody responses from immune memory, offering possible insights for improving vaccination strategy. Cell-based vaccines will reduce the impact of the seasonal virus at a lesser production and distribution cost.8
The FDA approved KP.2-adapted COVID-19 vaccines for the 2024-2025 season. The vaccines will include a monovalent component that corresponds to the KP.2 strain of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicrom JN.1 lineage, according to the FDA.9
The updated formulation pertains to both approved (Comirnaty and Spikevax) and authorized (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine) mRNA vaccines. Targeting the KP.2 strain is expected to provide better protection against COVID-19 based on current data indicating that KP.2-adapted vaccines generate a substantially improved neutralizing response against currently circulating Omicron JN.1 sublineages compared with Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted COVID-19 vaccines.
Children and young adults will be part of the new vaccine strategy.
Some final thoughts about immunizations. The problem for the health of the American people is not a virus, it is disinformation! 10  Clinicians need to listen and acknowledge patient and parent concerns, and always be kind. Patients and parents are afraid of what they hear and read, and they need nurse practitioners and physician associates to be their trusted sources of information.11 While progress has been made to get back to the immunization levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic, we have a way to go. Nurse practitioners are already instrumental in getting patients back on track with vaccines. Back to school offers an opportunity to have these all-important immunization conversations with parents and students, and get all children immunized.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/hidradenitis-suppurativa-biologics/,Use of Biologic Agents to Treat Refractory Hidradenitis Suppurativa: a Primary Care Case Study,"A 42-year-old woman presents to the urgent care clinic with several painful “boils” in her left axilla that have been present for the past 2 weeks. She reports that the boils started out small and have become larger, more inflamed, and more painful over time. The patient has had these in the past and has used both topical and oral antibiotics with some success. She was seen by her primary care provider 1 week ago, and despite treatment with intralesional corticosteroid injections and incision and drainage of the lesions by a surgeon, her condition worsened.
The patient’s medical history includes type 2 diabetes and hypertension, for which she takes metformin and losartan daily. She reports no allergies, hospitalizations, or other significant past surgeries other than the incision and drainage. She has a 20 pack-year history of cigarette smoking and denies alcohol or substance use. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago, with regular menses reported, and she has had 2 pregnancies carried to term. Her family history includes rheumatoid arthritis on her mother’s side but no other significant findings. Her review of systems is negative other than the current complaints.
On physical examination, the patient is a well-developed, obese white female in mild distress with stable vital signs except for a low-grade fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C). Assessment of her left axilla reveals numerous erythematous, inflamed, and tender abscesses with evidence of surrounding sinus tracts and scarring from previous exacerbations. No drainage is noted. Examination of the right axilla reveals old scarring and sinus tracts without active inflammation or adenopathy. The remainder of the dermatologic and general exam are clear, without evidence of pathology. The patient is diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), Hurley stage II. She refuses further surgical treatment due to pain and scarring and thus is started on oral tetracycline and referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment, potentially with biologic agents.
Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronically relapsing skin condition characterized by recurrent, inflamed and painful nodules, malodorous discharge, sinus formation, and scarring of intertriginous body regions.1 The disease affects the apocrine sweat glands in areas of the body where skin rubs together, such as the axillae, groin, and buttocks. It can be a debilitating condition that affects a person’s quality of life (QOL) by causing pain, discomfort, and embarrassment. It is associated with a variety of comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, axial spondyloarthritis, risk of cardiovascular disease, and mental health issues (anxiety, depression, sexual dysfunction).2 The cause of HS is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the immune system and hormonal changes. Treatment is mainly empirical and includes antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and surgery, as well as lifestyle changes such as weight loss and smoking cessation. In moderate to severe cases, treatment can be complex. A need for new effective interventions is acknowledged.
The exact cause of HS is unknown. Historically, apocrine glands were thought to play a main role; however, follicular occlusion is now believed to be the most likely mechanism, along with several other contributing factors. The most recognized risk factors for HS are related to genetics, hormones, obesity, cigarette smoking, medical conditions, age, and the environment (Table 1).3-5 Epidemiologic studies show that sex also plays a significant role in the development, severity, and location of HS.
The clinical presentation of HS involves severe inflammation, occlusion of the follicle, and scarring. These features are also common in dissecting cellulitis of the scalp and acne conglobate.4 Some experts also include pilonidal cyst/sinus and refer to the group as the follicular occlusion tetrad.4 It is important to note that not everyone with features of HS will go on to develop HS. Nonetheless, awareness of these influences is paramount for early diagnosis and effective treatment.
The presentation of HS is influenced by the severity, location, and stage of disease. Inflammatory nodules are thought to be the first type of lesion and are the mildest form, typically found in the axilla, groin, or buttocks. However, due to the location and similar presentation of other mild inflammatory conditions, HS is usually not diagnosed as early as one might expect. In a recent survey of 517 patients in 24 countries, the average diagnostic delay was 7.2 years and the median disease duration at the time of HS diagnosis was 2.5 years.6 This may be because HS is commonly misdiagnosed as boils or furuncles. The key distinguishing factor between HS and these conditions is that primary HS lesions are deep-seated and round-topped and lack the pointed appearance of furuncles.4
Symptoms of pain, burning, pruritus, and malodorous discharge are common in HS. The progression of a nodule to an abscess may yield purulent or serosanguineous drainage that is associated with pain relief. This can occur spontaneously or as a result of manipulation by the patient. Recurrent abscesses or boils described as painful and tender to palpation are also common. Many of these do not regress completely, resulting in scarring. In HS that persists for months or even years, inflammatory nodules or multiple abscesses may become interconnected, leading to the formation of sinuses or fistulas. Open comedones may also be seen in chronic HS and are often visualized as double- or multi-headed due to the loss of the sebaceous gland and hair from damage to the folliculopilosebaceous unit.4 With this more severe form, diffuse involvement of the skin can lead to scarring, contractures, and disability.
The appearance of HS-related scarring can vary depending on the affected nodule type and skin area. It can involve acneiform-type scars from occluded small nodules, to fibrotic, rope-like bands or indurated scarred plaques. Of note, severe scarring can reduce mobility and cause lymphedema in areas such as the axilla and groin. These factors and the chronic nature of the illness further reduce QOL in patients with HS.
The classification system used most widely for HS in clinical practice is the Hurley staging system (Table 2), first described in 1989. Hurley stages I, II, and III correspond to mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. This simplicity makes the Hurley system a preferred choice in both diagnostic measurement and treatment guidance. Other scoring systems, such as the Modified Sartorius Score, HS Physician Global Assessment, Severity Assessment of HS, HS Clinical Response, and International HS Severity Score System, are also used.4
A patient-oriented approach to treatment for HS involves lifestyle modifications, medical therapies, and/or surgical modalities and is based on patient preference, inflammatory activity, and disease severity. Treatment can be broken down into 4 elements:
Initial management of Hurley stage I/mild HS includes topical clindamycin 1% solution and intralesional corticosteroid injection (eg, triamcinolone acetonide 5-10 mg/mL administered directly into an inflammatory nodule). For an inadequate or non-response to topical clindamycin, the addition of oral tetracycline to therapy may be needed. For patients who do not improve with oral tetracycline or those presenting with Hurley stage II, the combination of clindamycin and rifampicin may be introduced.7
Other medical interventions, beyond topical and oral antibiotics, can also be considered for HS. Antiandrogenic therapies such as spironolactone work by reducing androgen levels and may help in managing hormonal factors contributing to HS. Metformin, dapsone, and acitretin also can be considered, as each has its unique mechanism of action. Metformin, often used in diabetes management, may have benefits in HS due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Dapsone is an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory medication. Acitretin, a retinoid, is known for its effect on skin cell growth.
In recent years, a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of HS has spurred research on potential molecular targets for new therapies, such as interleukin (IL)-17, the IL-1 axis, and JAK/STAT signaling.1 This approach aims to eliminate the need for temporary oral medications or surgical procedures, allow for a more sustainable recovery process, and potentially involve overlapping benefits with the use of different biological agents.
In contrast to other inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis vulgaris, only one drug—adalimumab—is FDA-approved for moderate to severe HS. This injectable tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, fully human monoclonal antibody is commonly used in the treatment of Crohn’s disease and other inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. Like Crohn’s disease, HS is an autoimmune disorder. Therefore, after multiple HS treatment failures, adalimumab is often the suggested treatment option.
With its mechanism of blocking TNF-alpha, adalimumab can reduce inflammation, pain, swelling, and drainage from HS lesions. It also has been shown to reduce the overall number of HS lesions and improve QOL in patients with moderate to severe HS.1 In 2 phase 3 multicenter, double-blind placebo-controlled studies (PIONEER I and PIONEER II), adalimumab was associated with significant efficacy vs placebo, with HS Clinical Response rates of 41.8% vs 26.0% and 58.9% vs 27.6% in the 2 studies, respectively.5,8
Adalimumab is administered as a subcutaneous injection with an initial loading dose of 160 mg followed by 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week.1 The dosage and frequency may be adjusted based on individual factors, such as symptom severity and treatment response. Common side effects of adalimumab may include injection-site reactions, upper respiratory infections, and headache. Less common but more concerning side effects may include infections, allergic reactions, and increased risk for certain types of cancer, including lymphoma.
The most promising biologics in phase 3 trials are secukinumab, and bimekizumab.7 Secukinumab is an IL-17A inhibitor used in the treatment of psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis.9 In an open-label study in moderate to severe HS, secukinumab 300 mg weekly and then every 3 or 4 weeks, led to at least a 50% reduction in inflammatory nodules and abscesses and no increase in draining fistula in 14 of 20 patients at 24 weeks.10
Bimekizumab is a blocker of both IL-17A and IL-17F. Randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of bimekizumab vs placebo or adalimumab in moderate to severe HS and underscore the potential role of biological agents in this disease.9
Surgical interventions for HS can range from procedural treatments to minor or major surgeries. Types of minimally invasive surgery include incision and drainage and deroofing of lesions. Incision and drainage are typically used for acute cases of tender, fluctuant abscesses and provide temporary relief but are associated with nearly 100% recurrence. Deroofing is used for persistent nodules and sinus tracts in Hurley stage II and III lesions. In an open study of deroofing in 44 patients with a total of 88 lesions located on the groin and axillae, the recurrence rate was 17% after 4.6 months, and 83% of patients showed no recurrence after 34 months.11 Post-procedural complications can include bleeding, infection, and scarring.
Excision is more invasive, aimed at removing the diseased tissue in its entirety, but can be limited depending on the type and area of the skin. As recurrence may be seen with any form of surgery, some patients require second or third revision procedures. These individuals consequently experience the increased morbidity that is associated with repeated surgeries.11
The debilitating nature of HS severely affects patient quality of life, mobility, and psychosocial health. Because there is no cure, the development of newer treatments is essential, particularly for patients in whom current medical and surgical options have been exhausted. Adalimumab is the only FDA-approved biologic for HS; however, secukinumab, an IL-17A inhibitor, is currently under FDA review for this use. If approved, secukinumab would offer a new avenue for managing HS by targeting specific molecular pathways associated with the condition. Use of biological agents already on the market for refractory cases of HS may also be something clinical practices are willing to consider for their patients.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/fda-rejects-mdma-assisted-therapy-for-ptsd-treatment/,FDA Rejects MDMA-Assisted Therapy for PTSD Treatment,"The Conversation — Drugmaker Lykos Therapeutics announced that the Food and Drug Administration declined to approve the company’s application for the use of MDMA-assisted therapy in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. It is the first such decision issued on a psychedelic drug application.
Many investors and researchers have been predicting a psychedelics boom, with MDMA being just the first of a number of psychedelics in the drug development pipeline.
The FDA’s decision has disappointed psychedelic therapy advocates, and the stock prices of psychedelic industry leaders tumbled with the announcement. But the FDA did make recommendations as to how the application could be improved in such a way that MDMA might receive future approval.
Yet another setback came days later when the journal Psychopharmacology retracted three papers related to MDMA-assisted therapy, citing “protocol violations amounting to unethical conduct,” particularly in one clinical trial.
MDMA, or midomafetamine, is known colloquially as “molly” or “ecstasy.” It is technically an amphetamine – like the drug in the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication Adderall – but MDMA is often categorized as a psychedelic. It is considered to be more pleasure-inducing than other amphetamines, and for this reason it has been a popular party drug. Some researchers call MDMA an “empathogen,” or a “feeling enhancer.”
While MDMA is currently a Schedule I drug – meaning that the Drug Enforcement Administration considers it to be highly dangerous with no accepted medical use – a number of clinical trials point to the benefits of using MDMA in combination with talk therapy for patients suffering from PTSD. The FDA granted “breakthrough therapy” status to MDMA-assisted therapy in 2017, which sped along its development and review.
PTSD affects between 9 million to 13 million people annually in the US, and no novel treatments for the condition have been developed in the past 20 years.
Lykos Therapeutics filed an application for FDA approval of its version of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD in February 2024. In it, the drug is paired with a type of psychotherapy intended to bring out a patient’s “inner healing intelligence”, which Lykos defines as “a person’s innate capacity to heal the wounds of trauma.”
In June 2024, an FDA advisory committee voted overwhelmingly against the idea that the relevant clinical trials had proved the efficacy of MDMA for the treatment of PTSD. Just as decisively, the panel also voted against the idea that the benefits had been shown to outweigh the risks, such as increased blood pressure and abuse potential.
At that time, the advisory committee took issue with several aspects of Lykos’ application. First, it noted the problem of “functional unblinding,” which is the fact that most people participating in the trial would know if they are on a powerful psychoactive substance or not, biasing the results. This is a problem for any psychoactive medication, and Lykos critics believe the company should have followed FDA guidance that it use an “active placebo” – a placebo that also has psychoactive effects – for comparison in its previous clinical trials.
The panel also raised questions about the form of psychotherapy used alongside MDMA, as well as ethical concerns about various forms of misconduct in Lykos’ trials. In one of the company’s studies, a participant reported sexual misconduct by the therapists involved.
The FDA is not bound by the votes of such advisory bodies, but it typically follows their guidance. So the decision on Friday was no great surprise.
The FDA requested an additional phase 3 study, the stage of clinical trials that rigorously demonstrates the safety and efficacy of a particular treatment in comparison to standard treatment.
Lykos stated that it will request a reconsideration of the decision and discuss the FDA’s recommendations with the agency to ensure that the company is on the right path forward.
Lykos CEO Amy Emerson, who called the decision “deeply disappointing,” says she believes it will take “several years” to conduct the new trial.
But with the journal Psychopharmacology’s retraction of three papers related to this work, Lykos has a difficult road ahead of it.
One prominent psychedelics company, Compass Pathways, is generally considered next in line for FDA approval of a psychedelic drug, with phase 3 clinical trials for its synthetic psilocybin well underway. There are other companies preparing for phase 3 trials of their own proprietary compounds.
In the wake of the advisory panel judgment in June, Compass noted that it is not pairing its drug with therapy in the way Lykos has. Another company claimed that it has a “better trial design that is more in line with FDA guidance.”
Other psychedelics companies clearly believe they can still succeed where Lykos has not.
The FDA’s decision was more about Lykos’ specific approach than an outright rejection of psychedelics for therapeutic use.
But psychedelic drug development is a fraught process by nature. The drugs involved induce a severely altered state that puts people in a vulnerable position. Some people in the industry that I have spoken to believe it’s nearly impossible to avoid accusations of impropriety, given the nature of the experience.
Most research also pairs psychedelic drugs with some form of therapy or facilitation, and as the FDA has made clear, its role is to assess drugs, not the psychotherapies that might go along with them.
The interaction between the drugs and the human element involved in the treatment is the subject of some debate. Lykos’ missteps in its application shine a light on some of the ways that companies involved in psychedelic drug development face unique obstacles on the way to FDA approval.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/infectious-diseases-spike-when-kids-return-to-school/,Infectious Diseases Spike When Kids Return to School − Here’s What You Can Do About It,"The Conversation — Ready or not, back-to-school season is here, and kids will be bringing home more than homework. They’ll be carrying germs, too.
These viruses and bacteria will be agents that cause the common cold, influenza, norovirus, COVID-19, strep throat and more. There’s a reason why boxes of tissues and sanitizing wipes show up on most school supply lists.
As a nursing professor with experience in public health promotion, I have spent the past several years helping the public understand how to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, especially the flu and COVID-19.
Here are some ways to minimize illness transmission from school to home.
In what health care providers call the summer wave, COVID-19 infections have been increasing throughout the summer of 2024. As of July 30, 2024, the number of COVID-19 infections has grown or is likely to grow in 35 states and territories.
Summer heat waves force people inside and into close proximity. As record-setting temperatures continue driving this trend, the number of COVID-19 cases is expected to increase. This increase is expected to extend into the 2024 to 2025 school year.
Currently, COVID-19 variants KP.3 and KP.3.1.1 are the dominant circulating virus strains. These variants are among the FLiRT variants, nicknamed after the locations of their spike protein mutations. These variants spread more easily from person to person and are able to evade vaccine-induced immunity better than previous strains.
These highly contagious COVID-19 strains, combined with the relaxed isolation guidelines that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released in March 2024, are likely to increase classroom disease transmission this coming school year. These updated CDC guidelines apply to all respiratory viruses, not just COVID-19.
The new guidelines recommend that everyone stay home when they are sick but also suggest that a person can return to normal activities once symptoms are improving and the person is fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication. While it is too early to know the transmission impact of these guidelines, they may lead to more people coming out of isolation while still infectious.
Children play a large role in transmitting the COVID-19 virus. Children often do not have overt symptoms when they are infected with COVID-19, leading to increased contact and spread.
A 2-year study following over 160,000 households composed of both adults and children found that just over 70% of viral transmissions, including COVID-19, in these households were pediatric index cases, meaning they started with a child. Further, these pediatric index cases were reduced by 60% to 80% during school breaks. This data suggests that COVID-19 infections will continue to increase once the school year starts.
In May 2024, the CDC also released guidance for preventing classroom spread of infectious disease, including COVID-19 and other common infectious diseases such as the flu, norovirus and strep throat. This guidance places emphasis on proper respiratory etiquette, hand-washing and vaccination.
Proper cough and sneeze hygiene is especially important to reduce transmission of diseases such as COVID-19 and the flu, which are commonly transmitted through respiratory droplets. Coughs and sneezes create respiratory droplets that can be full of viruses or bacteria. Because these droplets are forcefully expelled, they can be spread around the environment and inhaled by another person.
That’s why it is important to turn your face away from others and cover up coughing or sneezing with a tissue and then quickly dispose of the tissue. If a tissue is not available, your sleeve is the next best option. Whichever method you use, it is important to wash your hands afterward. In addition to encouraging proper respiratory etiquette, classrooms should also have appropriate ventilation.
The CDC’s classroom guidance also focuses on proper hand-washing. Up to 80% of infectious diseases are spread through touch. Classrooms have countless high-touch surfaces, including light switches, tabletops, shared supplies, doorknobs, sports equipment and toys.
Proper hand-washing can prevent about 30% of diarrhea-related illness and about 20% of respiratory infections, such as colds and flu. The CDC also reports that proper hand-washing reduces absenteeism due to gastrointestinal illness by up to 57%.
Another important part of reducing classroom spread of infectious disease is keeping children up to date on vaccinations. Proper vaccination can reduce disease transmission rates 40% to 50% for flu and COVID-19, 80% for child pneumococcal cases, upward of 90% for chickenpox and 100% for diseases such as polio and smallpox.
For the past several years, the CDC has recommended receiving the flu and COVID-19 vaccine at the same time when possible. Despite this recommendation, there has been some hesitancy in the uptake of both vaccines at the same time.
A 2024 Canadian study found that 20% of respondents did not see the benefit in co-administration, and another 17% were concerned about adverse reactions of receiving both vaccines together. However, several years of CDC data demonstrates the safety of receiving the flu and COVID-19 vaccines together.
Moderna recently released Phase 3 clinical trial data on a new combination vaccine against both the flu and COVID-19. This combination vaccine, currently called mRNA-1083, has demonstrated higher effectiveness when compared with individual vaccines for the flu or COVID-19. Moderna is expected to seek FDA approval soon. This combination vaccine may increase vaccine uptake because only 1 shot will be required instead of 2.
The most important way to reduce the spread of germs in school is to follow the principle of keeping kids home when they’re sick. When sick kids go to school, they infect not only other students but teachers and staff too. When teachers get sick, it affects student learning and costs the US billions of dollars each year.
Most schools and day care centers have guidelines on when to keep a child at home. As a general rule, a child should stay home from school or day care if they have a fever, vomiting, diarrhea or if they are generally unwell and unable to fully participate in school.
Without the presence of a fever, it is OK to go to school with a cough or runny nose, as long as the child feels well enough to participate in class. To return to school or day care, the child should be fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications. When a student is returning to school with respiratory symptoms, consider having them take extra precautions, such as using a mask to protect others for the next 5 days.
If you have concerns about whether to send your child to school, it’s always a good idea to seek advice from your health care provider.
Last but not least, focusing on healthy habits such as getting enough sleep and exercise, as well as eating nutritious meals, helps boost the immune system.
These actions should be practiced by family members of all ages.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/health_care_on_the_ballot/,Health Care on the Ballot,"It is less than 2 months before the November 5, 2024 presidential election. A lot has changed from the beginning of the campaign. There was an attempt on the life of Former President Donald Trump just ahead of the Republican National Convention, which saw JD Vance picked as the VP candidate. President Biden stepped down as the Democratic nominee, which opened the path to a Kamala Harris/Tim Walz ticket.
Let’s briefly look at how the parties compare on access to health care. The Obama-Biden administration passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in March 2010. In 2017, Mr Trump unsuccessfully attempted to repeal and replace ACA. The Biden-Harris administration successfully passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which expanded eligibility for ACA marketplace subsidies. The current administration also saw record-high enrollment in ACA marketplace, according to Kaiser Family Foundation. Candidate Trump has called to “never give up” on repealing the ACA.
Women’s reproductive rights are one of the centerpieces of the Harris ticket. Vice President Harris supports a federal law to restore Roe v Wade, which created a national standard of protecting a pregnant woman’s constitutional right to an abortion before the viability of the fetus. Mr Trump takes credit for repealing Roe v Wade and supports leaving abortion policy to the states. ACA enacted a contraceptive coverage requirement that Ms Harris supports but Mr Trump would try to repeal.
LGBTQ Health: As president, Mr Trump worked to remove LGBT rights and access to health care. As a candidate, Mr Trump has proposed to prohibit gender-affirming care for young people. The Biden-Harris administration has issued an executive order seeking to advance equity for LGBTQ people. Currently, 25 states bar transgender people from accessing gender-affirming health care.
Both parties have worked to reduce prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries and protect consumers from unexpected medical bills through the No Surprises Act.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/rsv-symptoms/,"RSV: Symptoms, Diagnostic Testing, Treatment, Prevention, and Patient FAQs","Our easy-to-read fact sheets provide clinicians with reliable information to share with patients and their caregivers.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants, children, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals.1 The virus is one of the main causes of hospitalization and death among infants and a leading cause of pneumonia in adults aged 65 years and older. The risk for asthma is nearly 3-times greater in children aged 3 years and younger who contract RSV infection. Among adults, RSV may exacerbate symptoms in those with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, arrhythmia, and heart attack.2
The most common symptoms observed in hospitalized infants are cough, runny nose or congestion, irregular breathing, and change in eating habits, with similar symptom presentation among children in community settings. Young children are less likely to experience fever but more likely to experience wheezing or rapid breathing. The mean length of hospital (LOS) stay for children with RSV is 4 to 5 days; however, prolonged hospitalization may occur among those with severe disease who require mechanical ventilation.2
Among adults with RSV in community settings, the most common symptoms include runny nose or congestion, cough, and sleep disturbance. In hospital settings, adults most commonly experience cough, congestion, fever, weakness, and irregular breathing. In immunocompromised adult patients, the most common symptoms include cough, fever, and irregular breathing. Symptoms of RSV in adult patients can last up to 20 days, and hospital LOS can range from approximately 3 to 20 days, depending on symptom severity.2
Although testing is not always performed for suspected RSV infection, the most common way to test for RSV is via nasal swabbing. To confirm infection, the sample collected via nasal swab is placed on a test strip to determine if the virus is present. These tests, known as first-generation point-of-care tests, are typically performed when a patient presents to a clinic with symptoms suggestive of RSV infection. Rapid chromatographic immunoassay tests can be used to obtain results quickly; however, they are less sensitive than reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which can take up to 1 hour to detect small quantities of the virus.3
Second-generation point-of-care tests also use samples collected via nasal swabbing to detect viral nucleoproteins in patients younger than 20, but these tests cannot distinguish between the type of RSV present. Samples may also be sent to a clinical laboratory for testing, though results may not be returned for several hours or days with this diagnostic method.3
Most cases of RSV can be treated at home with symptom-based care. Over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can be used to reduce fever, and physicians can recommend the appropriate dose for children and infant. Although nasal saline drops and suctioning can help relieve symptoms of congestion in children with RSV, staying hydrated is also important.4
Nebulized 3% saline may also be used in children with severe RSV-associated bronchiolitis to improve symptoms and reduce the LOS in the hospital.5
One way to prevent RSV infection is frequent hand washing with soap and water; it is recommended to wash continuously for 20 seconds. Other preventive measures include avoiding close contact with symptomatic individuals as well as disinfecting surfaces.6
Vaccinations are available to lower the risk for severe RSV infection. Although no vaccines have been approved for pediatric patients, protection against RSV among infants can be achieved through maternal vaccination during pregnancy. It is recommended that pregnant women receive the Abrysvo® RSV vaccine between weeks 24 and 36 of pregnancy to confer protection to their infant after delivery. If maternal vaccination is not available, infants can receive a single injection of nirsevimab to provide them with the antibodies necessary to minimize disease severity.1
A single RSV vaccine dose is recommended for adults aged 60 years and older at increased risk for severe disease. The 3 RSV vaccines available for older adult patients include Abrysvo, as well as Arvexy® and mRESVIA®.
Testing procedures for RSV, influenza, and COVID-19 are similar. For all 3 infections, testing involves nasal swabbing to retrieve a sample to be used on a rapid test strip or PCR test to identify the type of infection.7
Risk factors for severe RSV infection include preterm birth, vitamin D deficiency, chronic lung disease, immunodeficiency, older age, and exposure to second-hand smoking. Children living with other school-aged children or siblings are also at increased risk for RSV. Compared with older children, infants are at a greater risk for severe illness as their airways are smaller and more prone to obstruction.6
The virus is highly contagious. The virus is transmitted from an infected person via droplets commonly released via cough or sneeze, which may then enter another individual via the eyes, nose, or mouth. A single cough is estimated to produce up to 3000 droplets and the infectious can remain for up to 6 hours on nonporous surfaces, such as glass, countertops, or metal. Droplets can remain contagious for up to 2 hours on some surfaces, such as paper or fabric, and for up to 30 minutes on skin. Airborne transmission of the disease may occur if smaller droplets are inhaled.6
Children who are diagnosed with severe RSV-associated bronchiolitis can develop asthma.5 However, most symptoms of RSV typically resolve within 20 days.2

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/depression-and-cardiovascular-disease/,Early Detection of Depression Key to Halting Cardiovascular Disease,"Depressive disorders (DDs) are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).1 In the United States, those with DDs are 3 times more likely to develop CVD than those without DDs, and CVD develops on average 7.5 years earlier than those without major depressive disorder (MDD).2 Although the cause-and-effect relationship between these 2 diseases is poorly understood, it is believed to be multifactorial and bidirectional. The lifetime prevalence of MDD in the US is 20.6% and continues to increase,3 making DDs a significant modifiable CVD risk factor that must be addressed. Screening and early treatment of DDs are just as important in preventing CVD as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and smoking.
Cardiovascular disease encompasses a myriad of conditions, including coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, transient ischemic attack, peripheral vascular disease, and heart failure.4 Depressive disorders also encompass multiple diseases, such as MDD, dysthymia, bipolar II disorder, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, seasonal affective disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, and other mood disorders.
Approximately 7% of adults in the US have DDs,5 with 4% suffering from MDD.2 The 12-month prevalence of MDD is 10.4% and lifetime prevalence is 20.6%.3 In 2015, DDs were responsible for 3.7% of all disability-adjusted life-years,6 and it is the leading cause of disability worldwide.4
The correlation between CVD and DDs appears to disproportionately affect women more than men.  Women have a 50% greater prevalence of DD than Men.2,5
As the incidence of DDs increases, the risk for CVD also increases.6 The INTERHEART study7 evaluated modifiable risk factors affecting MI across 52 countries of varying economic status. Risk factors were then ranked by population attributable risk. The authors reported that psychological factors ranked third highest modifiable risk factor behind dyslipidemia and smoking. Psychological factors were shown to be more significant risk factors for MI than diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. The American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology have declared DDs a modifiable prognostic factor for coronary heart disease.4 Despite this fact, the mechanism by which DDs increase the risk for CVD, or vice versa, is poorly understood.8
The simplest explanation for the relationship between DDs and CVD is detection, not causation. Because many diseases included under the umbrella of CVD can be asymptomatic for many years, they do not prompt the individual to seek medical care and thus may go undiagnosed. Patients with DDs, however, are more likely to seek medical attention for other somatic manifestations and may incidentally be found to have CVD.1
Depression also is associated with many unhealthy behaviors that are known risk factors for CVD. These include smoking, increased alcohol consumption, inappropriate use of prescription medications and illicit substances, poor nutrition, physical inactivity, poor hygiene, and poor adherence to medications (Table).1,2
Table. Rate of Participation in Known CVD Risk Behaviors
The catecholamine hormones produced in response to stress include dopamine, noradrenaline (norepinephrine), and adrenaline (epinephrine). Platelet dysfunction resulting from catecholamine exposure has been linked to many cardiovascular disorders, such as angina pectoris, heart failure, atherosclerosis, thrombus formation, and arterial hypertension.9
A 3-fold increase in platelet thromboxane production has been noted with epinephrine infusions.9 This increase enhances fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation. Dopamine has been found to increase platelet microaggregate formation and adhesion to collagen. Because platelets and neurons share many similarities in their subcellular organization and protein composition, platelet aggregation may mimic neuronal function and be correlated with DDs.9
Dopamine and serotonin levels also may be affected by dysregulation of the gut microbiome through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. There is strong evidence that DDs and CVD are each independent catalysts for gut microbiome dysregulation through the HPA axis. It is possible that DDs and CVD can each be caused by changes to the gut microbiome.10,11 The gut microbiome also can be altered by many other non-mood or cardiac causes, such as irritable bowel syndrome, thus producing DDs and CVD simultaneously.10
Elevated levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine are also found in patients suffering from DDs. In addition to changes in serum levels, there is a direct correlation between the severity of depressive symptoms and catecholamine levels in the urine.9
It has been well established that inflammation plays a causative role in many forms of CVD, such as atherosclerosis and MI.12 Cytokines can be broken down into pro-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-6, and anti-inflammatory factors, such as IL-4 and IL-10.9 Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are found in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with DDs, as are low levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines.12
Vagal Tone. Vagal tone, or activity of the vagus nerve, is responsible for cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. A decrease in vagal tone increases the risk for CVD. Decreased vagal tone also affects mood disorders. However, it is not known whether this is a direct cause-or-effect relationship.12
Adipokines. Adipokines are neuroendocrine regulators that affect energy metabolism. Adiponectin is an anti-inflammatory adipokine associated with cardioprotective effects and decreased CVD risk. In patients with DDs, adiponectin levels are low and treatment with antidepressants has been shown to increase these levels.9
Leptin is a vital adipokine involved in regulating food intake and inflammatory reactions. Increased leptin levels have been linked to obesity, atherosclerosis, and thrombus. Elevated levels of leptin after MI are associated with increased mortality, stroke, and heart failure.9
Although the metabolism of leptin and gene expression have been noted to be altered in those with DDs, no differences in levels of leptin have been reported between depressed and nondepressed patients.9
Reactive Oxygen Species. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, are formed by partial oxygen reduction and easily react with molecules within cells, resulting in cellular damage. An increase in ROS and the resulting cellular damage have been associated with CVD and DDs. It is unclear whether ROS would result in DDs causing CVD or vice versa. Instead, ROS is likely a common causative agent for DDs and CVD, increasing the likelihood that the 2 diseases would coexist.12
Antidepressant Medications. Many antidepressant medications have been associated with CVD. Tricyclic antidepressants are linked to an increased risk for stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, and MI.13,14 The more commonly used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) cause corrected QT prolongation, which is rarely of clinically significance. Serotonin inhibitors also increase the risk for nonfatal stroke. Stroke is more commonly seen with SNRIs compared with SSRIs.2,13,15 Mood stabilizers such as lithium are associated with sinus node dysfunction, bradycardia, and atrioventricular heart blocks.13 As a result, treatment for DDs can be considered a causative factor for CVD.
Grief. Prolonged grief reactions may result in DDs through the concept of loss. Anxiety is often the result of fear of a potential loss. Depression commonly results from an “actual” loss. A loss, however, does not need to be recognized by others to be “actual.” It only needs to be objectively real to the individual. Patients with CVD often experience loss of health, occupation, income, social role, status, or independence, increasing the risk of developing a DD.3
MI: A Normal Response. For every 3 patients hospitalized for MI, 2 will develop some form of DD.2 The most common type is adjustment disorder with depressed mood. To meet the diagnostic criteria, there must have been an identifiable stressful event in the preceding 3 months. An adjustment disorder with depressed mood can be a normal response and may improve within 6 months. Symptoms of depression that occur after 3 months and last longer than 6 months no longer qualify as an adjustment disorder with depressed mood.3
There is no clear threshold for when depressive symptoms begin to increase the risk for CVD. However, the risk for CVD is increased not only by the length of a single depressive episode but the cumulative time affected by the DD.5 This evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of DDs may effectively prevent CVD.
For much of the research discussing DDs and CVD, DDs are often assessed using a screening questionnaire and not confirmed by a mental health provider or the criteria set forth by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Physician associates (PAs) and nurse practitioners(NPs) can quickly screen for depression in any clinical setting.
The 2 most commonly used screening tools are the 2- and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQs).6 Each item is scored from 0 to 3. The PHQ-2 includes 2 items: “little interest or pleasure in doing things” and “feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.” A score of 3 or more is a positive result. The PHQ-2 is also approved for adolescents as young as 12 years. The US Preventive Service Task Force and American Academy of Family Physicians recommend initiating annual depression screening at 12 years of age. The PHQ-9 assesses the severity of depression from minimal to severe based on the score. Both tests have similar sensitivity; however, the specificity increases from 78% with the PHQ-2 to 92% for the PHQ-9.6 A positive score on either test should elicit evaluation by a mental health professional.
Depression affects the effectiveness of rehabilitation after an acute coronary event. The addition of group therapy and antidepressants improves success rates during cardiac rehabilitation. The use of SSRIs after an acute coronary event has been shown to decrease rates of cardiac-related hospital readmissions.14,15
Improved screening for and treatment of DDs are needed. Screening must be implemented at the primary care level to recognize and treat DDs before an individual develops CVD. PAs and NPs working in cardiology, interventional cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, cardiac rehabilitation, and primary care should are encouraged to conduct routine screenings. With 66% of patients developing DDs after acute coronary events, as well as its negative effect on recovery, screening for DDs should be as common as advising postcoronary patients to stop smoking or maintain a healthy diet.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/adolescent-seizures-nonmotor-ed/,Nonmotor Seizures in Adolescents Missed in ED: How to Ask the Right Questions,"Early diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy is intrinsic to the prevention of worse disease outcomes, developmental delays, and seizure-related injuries and deaths.1,2
The results of a recently published study in Neurology indicate that nonmotor seizures are rarely recognized in adolescents presenting to the emergency department (ED), which can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment within this patient population.3
Researchers of a retrospective analysis of enrollment data from the Human Epilepsy Project aimed to assess the recognition rate of motor vs nonmotor seizures in 83 adolescents aged 12 to 18 who had focal epilepsy and were evaluated in pediatric and non-pediatric EDs.3
At the time of presentation to the ED, 70% of all patients lacked an epilepsy diagnosis. Although most patients (90%) visited the ED for motor seizures, many also had a history of nonmotor seizures (38%).3
Compared with motor seizures, nonmotor seizures were less likely to be correctly identified (81% vs 33%; P =.008). Nonmotor seizures were also often misattributed to causes such as anxiety, dehydration, and gastrointestinal complaints.3
In patients presenting with first-time motor seizures who also had a history of nonmotor seizures, the history of nonmotor seizures went unrecognized. Compared with the rate of recognition of nonmotor seizure history among adolescents, the rate of recognition among adults is greater, but still low (23%).3
“Our study highlights a critical need for physicians to inquire about the symptoms of nonmotor seizures, even when the presenting seizure is motor. Future interventions should focus on improving nonmotor seizure recognition for this population in EDs,” the researchers concluded.3
The failure to recognize a history of nonmotor seizures can lead to diagnostic delays, as clinicians may consider the motor seizure to be a first-lifetime seizure rather than 1 of many seizures, which would prompt an epilepsy diagnosis and initiation of antiseizure medication.
“We have seen this result in another tonic-clonic seizure occurring in close succession to the first after the person has been discharged from the ED, and this second tonic-clonic seizure has led to injuries in some cases,” explained study co-author Jacqueline French, MD, professor in the department of neurology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and Comprehensive Epilepsy Center and director of The Epilepsy Study Consortium (TESC).
According to Dr French, “Failure to recognize nonmotor seizures leads to unnecessary delays in the initiation of therapy. This is particularly important, because once therapy is initiated, it is quite likely to be effective.”
“While the failure to recognize nonmotor seizures can also occur in the outpatient clinic and other settings, most individuals experiencing a tonic-clonic seizure will present to the ED, so the ED serves as an opportunity to address this issue,” she continued.
Although the study did not divulge why the recognition of nonmotor seizures was less common among adolescents vs adults, Dr French suggested that the discrepancy may be attributable to adolescents having a greater difficulty describing the symptoms of nonmotor seizures, or that the ED staff may be more likely to discount reports of nonmotor events in adolescents.
According to the study data, many of the participants with a history of nonmotor seizures had previously described their symptoms in similar ways, including hearing voices, auditory disturbances, episodes of “aura,” feelings of tingling or numbness, and feelings of fear or anxiety. These symptoms “conceivably could have been elicited with a thorough review of systems that included a nonmotor line of questioning,” the researchers noted.
To accurately recognize a history of nonmotor seizures in patients presenting with what may at first appear to be a single motor seizure incident, Dr French and her colleagues emphasized the importance of thorough history taking and asking 2 key questions:
According to a 2022 qualitative study based on interviews with 10 physicians, the following 5 characteristics may help identify seizures:
Clinicians may ask patients about any other short-lasting, stereotyped episodes they may have experienced, Dr French explained. An affirmative response “should prompt discussion about starting an antiseizure medication or urgent discussion with, or referral to a neurologist, depending on what is described,” she advised.
In line with the current findings, previous research has found substantially longer diagnostic delays in individuals with initial nonmotor seizures.5 In addition to delays in treatment initiation, delayed diagnosis adds unnecessary stress to the parents and families of children with epilepsy.3 Improving rates of accurate and timely diagnosis in these patients will require ongoing education of ED physicians, as well as further research dedicated to the exploration of the frequency of unrecognized nonmotor seizures in the ED and related consequences.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/vitamins-for-crohns-disease/,How Does Crohn Disease Cause Vitamin Deficiency?,"Our easy-to-read fact sheets provide clinicians with reliable information to share with patients and their caregivers.
Crohn disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and irritation in the digestive tract. This is a lifelong disease; while it cannot be cured, it can be well-managed with proper treatment and interventions.1
There is not a single identifiable cause for the development of this disease. Ultimately, CD causes a dysfunction in the immune system in which immune cells inappropriately attack healthy gut bacteria. Researchers note that it can be caused by a variety of factors, such as age, genes, and smoking.1
Symptoms of CD may vary based on severity and location; it can be gradual or happen instantly. A “flare” is when symptoms are active. Patients may experience diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. CD exacerbates other conditions, such as vitamin deficiency, which may result in a variety of symptoms that affect neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and other systems in the body. Symptoms can include joint pain, rashes, and kidney stones.1
Individuals with CD are at higher risk for vitamin deficiency. The inflammation associated with this condition can impair the body’s ability to absorb essential nutrients like vitamins. Additionally, pain and nausea from the disease can reduce appetite, leading to lower nutrient intake. Over time, this can contribute to malnutrition among patients with CD.²
The following vitamin deficiencies are commonly associated with CD:3
What works for one patient will not work for everyone. An IBD-friendly diet can help patients get more of the nutrients they are lacking. Since certain foods can lead to discomfort for patients with CD, it is crucial to inform a doctor about any foods that cause problems. A doctor may suggest oral supplements, such as over-the-counter (OTC) vitamins, as alternatives to these problematic foods. It is important to discuss with a health care provider to determine the right strength of vitamin supplement for the patient, since it can vary based on sex, weight, age, and preexisting conditions. Taking too much of a supplement can cause side effects. Always check the supplements’ nutrition labels for preservatives, artificial colors, or sugars that may aggravate CD.⁴
Table. Types of Vitamin Deficiencies and Associated Dietary or Supplement Recommendations

Eating a well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet can help provide patients with the needed nutrients. This means incorporating a variety of vegetables, fruits, healthy proteins, and fortified whole grains into your diet while staying hydrated. However, with a CD diagnosis, it is not certain which foods can specifically cause a symptom flare. Depending on the situation and after consulting with a doctor, it may be best to initiate OTC vitamins or multivitamins to supplement nutrient deficiencies. Some supplements that have shown to be helpful in a patient with CD are omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, iron, zinc, and vitamins B12, D, A, and K. The frequency and dose of consumption should be listed on each supplement bottle. It is essential to be adherent to routine checkups with your provider. If you are experiencing any symptoms, notify your health care provider.⁶
The frequency depends on current symptoms, risk factors, and individual health conditions. It is standard practice to check all vitamin levels, via blood test, at least once per year. However, some providers recommend that patients with active disease, on corticoid medication, or those suspected of having a vitamin deficiency be tested more than once a year (potentially 2 or 3 times per year).  Moreover, certain groups of patients, such as vegetarians, pregnant individuals, and older adults, may require more than the standard annual testing.8
This depends on the patient and their medication history. It is possible for vitamins and food to interact with certain medications. Talk to your provider if you experience any symptoms.
Some notable examples of common CD medication drug and food interactions are the following:

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/oral-ulcerations-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-patient/,A Puzzling Case: Oral Ulcerations in a Patient With Rheumatoid Arthritis,"A 94-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider complaining of mouth sores. The sores have been present for 3 to 4 months without improvement. The patient reports the onset of the ulcers coincided with a change to her medication regimen for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that she had been taking for years. The ulcers are in the back of her throat and on both sides of her gums. She describes the ulcers as painful to the touch, making consumption of food difficult.
Since the onset of the ulcers, the patient has lost 15 lbs, and nothing has helped alleviate her mouth pain despite using Orajel™ mouthwash. In addition to her weight loss, the patient has noticed daily fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and acid reflux. She denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or muscle weakness/ataxia. She rates her pain as 8 out of 10.
Her medical history includes a long-standing diagnosis of RA and osteoarthritis. She also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Current medications include methotrexate (RA), budesonide/formoterol  (COPD), and tramadol (osteoarthritis). The patient denies any allergies and is up to date on her vaccinations.
The patient’s vital signs are unremarkable, except for a noted 15-lb weight loss since  her last visit 6 months ago. Physical examination is remarkable for several irregular erythematous ulcerations along the buccal mucosa bilaterally, the right posterior pharyngeal wall, and the midline of the soft palate. The ulcerations are tender to palpation and bleed easily when scraped. The patient’s dentures are clean and fit appropriately. The tongue appears slightly enlarged. The uvula is non-deviated and the gag reflex is intact. There is no lymphadenopathy palpated in the anterior or posterior cervical chains. The tonsils are absent. The patient can swallow liquids but with difficulty.
After the examination, blood work was ordered that included a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, complete metabolic panel (CMP), and a peripheral blood smear. The patient is also scheduled to have an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) the following week with an outpatient gastroenterology specialist.
Once the laboratory results are completed, review of the reports is revealing (Table 1). The CBC illustrates reduced red and white blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets. The CBC also reveals an elevated mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, absolute neutrophils, and red cell distribution width.
The results of the CMP are unremarkable, with low and high values being within acceptable range. Analysis of the blood smear shows normochromic red blood cells that are macrocytic. The blood smear also reveals hypersegmented neutrophils, as evident by the many lobes visualized within the neutrophils themselves.
The results of the EGD are remarkable for dispersed ulcerations in the upper third of the esophagus with metaplastic changes at the gastroesophageal junction, the latter unrelated to the current ulcerations but because of prolonged acid reflux.
With the CBC, blood smear results, and EGD evaluation, it is evident the patient has a macrocytic anemia. But what is the cause of this anemia and could it be the root of the patient’s oral ulcers? To answer these questions, more laboratory work is ordered. These laboratory tests included homocysteine, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and serum folate levels (Table 2).
The laboratory work reveals elevated homocysteine with a normal MMA; folate levels are critically low. In concert with all the laboratory results, the diagnosis of folate deficiency anemia is made.1,2
To identify the cause of this patient’s anemia, understanding the various entities that can be responsible for reduced folate has to be analyzed. Upon further questioning of the patient, it is discovered that the medication change that occurred around the onset of the ulcers was to her methotrexate. The dosage of the methotrexate was increased.
Methotrexate is considered the first-line treatment for RA. Despite this long-term use, the exact mechanism of action is not firmly understood.3 In this case, the proposed mechanism for oral ulcerations is because of the antagonistic action that methotrexate has on folic acid receptors and transport molecules in inflamed tissues.3 With methotrexate bound to folic acid transport molecules and receptors, any viable folic acid present in the body is left to be excreted by the kidneys and intestines, never absorbed for use. Folate is the water-soluble vitamin, vitamin B9, and folic acid is the oxidized, stable form of folate. Folate and folic acid play important roles in preventing neural tube defects, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, depression, and osteoporosis.4
For the patient, the increase in methotrexate dosage significantly depleted her folic acid stores, as evidenced by the critically low laboratory result. Deficiencies in folate lead to poor cellular metabolism, impaired cellular division, and impaired enzymatic reactions required for gene regulation.4-6 This breakdown of normal cellular function leads to a breakdown of tissues, most notably in the gastrointestinal tract.
The treatment of choice for this patient was straightforward: Withhold her methotrexate dosage and begin folate vitamin supplementation for symptom resolution. Withholding the methotrexate dosage while restoring her depleted folate stores is the recommended course of action in this clinical scenario.7,8 When the oral ulcerations had resolved and the patient reported a significant reduction in pain, the methotrexate was restarted at the lower dosage. In addition, daily folate vitamin supplementation was added to the patient’s pharmacologic regimen to prevent further occurrence of ulcers. Moving forward, serial laboratory blood work is required to monitor for signs of improvement, resolution of anemia, and folic acid levels.
Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by chronic inflammatory erosive changes in the joints caused by an autoimmune response.9 The disease can occur in any decade of life, but predominantly arises in the third to fourth decade. Symptoms can be variable: joint swelling, erythema of the joints, fatigue, periodic fevers, and morning stiffness that improves with activity.9 The joints classically afflicted by RA are the metacarpophalangeal, metatarsophalangeal, and proximal interphalangeal joints.10
Early recognition of RA symptoms is imperative to prevent further joint damage and initiate treat-to-target therapy.11,12 Vigilance for the recognition of oral ulceration and potential connection to medication use should be suspected when a patient presents with such complaints.
Treatment of RA is aimed at producing remission or reducing disease activity to a low-disease activity level.10,12 Many pharmacologic options are used to fight the progression of RA. The most widely used drug, the first-line option for RA, is methotrexate. Methotrexate’s side effect profile includes nausea, hair loss, gastrointestinal upset, folic acid degradation, and hepatotoxicity.10 Health care providers must be mindful of these side effects and monitor for them with routine laboratory work. Mitigating these side effects will ensure patient medication adherence and improved clinical outcomes.8,10,13

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/sleep-apnea-and-obesity/,Sleep Apnea and Obesity: Is There a Bidirectional Relationship?,"Our easy-to-read fact sheets provide clinicians with reliable information to share with patients and their caregivers.
Although sleep apnea is not always associated with weight, obesity is one of the leading causes of sleep apnea. Sleep apnea can be treated independently, or it can be managed by treating any underlying causes, such as obesity.
Obesity has become increasingly common among adults and children in the US and around the world. Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher. A diagnosis of obesity is associated with higher annual health care and medication costs. The condition has a variety of causes including genetics, leptin deficiency, brain injury, and depression. Obesity can lead to many complications, including increased risk for diabetes, heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, and high blood pressure. It can also lead to obstructive sleep apnea.1
Sleep apnea is a condition in which breathing stops and restarts during sleep, usually disrupting sleep patterns.2 There are two types of sleep apnea, central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea.
Central sleep apnea occurs when the brain stops sending the proper signals to the muscles that control breathing while asleep. This is most common in people with a history of heart failure, stroke, or opioid use. It can also occur when sleeping at high altitudes, where the air pressure is lower. Symptoms of central sleep apnea include shortness of breath that causes sleep disruption, observed pauses in breathing while asleep, and trouble falling or staying asleep. These may also lead to daytime symptoms such as mood changes, excessive daytime sleepiness, and trouble focusing.
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when the muscles that control breathing are working, but the upper airways become blocked, preventing the body from getting enough oxygen and waking the person up to breathe. Blockages can form from body mass weighing down the airways in the chest and neck area or from a person’s tongue falling back to block the airway. These breathing interruptions prevent the person from getting good-quality sleep, which can have daytime effects like excessive sleepiness, mental illness, impaired driving, or work performance. Obstructive sleep apnea has been associated with higher risk for cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. Symptoms of OSA include waking up from sleep gasping for breath or choking, as well as loud and disruptive snoring.
Excess body fat in the abdomen and chest can decrease lung volume, or the amount of oxygen the lungs can hold, by limiting the amount the chest can expand and narrow the airways. Excess fat in the neck area can increase pressure on the upper airways, potentially collapsing the airway. Research has linked a 10% increase in BMI to a 32% increase in the number of times breathing stops or pauses during sleep. Excess fat in all of these areas can cause obstructive sleep apnea in individuals with obesity, especially when the person is lying down on their back, and lead to symptoms like snoring or feelings of choking upon waking.3 It is estimated that 25% of all adults will experience obstructive sleep apnea, and that as many as 45% of adults with obesity will experience this condition.4
The primary treatment for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine during the night. CPAP is a machine that uses mild air pressure to keep airways open and increase lung volume during sleep. This treatment can lessen or eliminate snoring, improve sleep quality, and lessen daytime sleepiness. Side effects of CPAP treatment may include congestion, runny nose, dry mouth, or nosebleeds. If a CPAP machine is prescribed by a doctor, insurance may cover the costs.3
For patients with obesity and sleep apnea, weight loss can improve lung function and lessen the severity of obstructive sleep apnea, but will rarely get rid of it entirely. The American Thoracic Society recommends a comprehensive lifestyle intervention program including reduced-calorie diet, increased physical activity, and behavioral counseling.3 Exercise has been shown to improve symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea even when there is minimal weight loss associated with the exercise, but lifestyle intervention programs have shown better improvement in sleep apnea than just weight loss or exercise alone.5,6 A 10% reduction in weight has been linked to a 26% reduction in the number of times breathing stops or pauses during sleep.3
Bariatric surgery has also been shown to improve or resolve sleep apnea in many but not all patients. Notably, there are many variables that may impact resolution, such as the severity of obstructive sleep apnea, the presence of type 2 diabetes, the patient’s age, and the percentage of body weight lost as a result of the surgery.7 Studies have shown that bariatric surgery resulted in resolution or improvement of obstructive sleep apnea in up to 86% of study participants, though it is possible for symptoms to return with weight gain and aging.3,5
Medications for weight loss such as phentermine HCl/topiramate extended-release may also improve symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea in people with obesity, and can improve daytime wakefulness. Since symptom resolution is often seen while taking the medication, patients stopping medication should take measures to maintain weight loss.8
In some cases, sleep apnea can be improved by lying down on your side instead of lying supine on your back. This relieves some of the pressure being placed on the airways and can improve breathing during sleep.9 Weight loss and exercise are also methods that may improve sleep apnea without the need for pharmacological interventions.
Yes, people of average weight and BMI can experience obstructive sleep apnea, though it is less common than in people with obesity.10 It is estimated that approximately 25% of adults will experience obstructive sleep apnea.4 Central sleep apnea may also be experienced by people regardless of their weight and may be caused by heart failure, stroke, opioid use, or other conditions.11
Sleep apnea can occur at any age, but the risk increases as people get older. This is because fatty tissue can build up in the neck and tongue areas, making it harder to breathe while lying down in a supine position.3
No, not all people with obesity will experience sleep apnea. It is estimated that up to 45% of people with obesity experience obstructive sleep apnea.4

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/menopause-increases-risk-of-sexually-transmitted-infections/,Menopause Increases Risk of Sexually Transmitted Infections,"The Conversation — Diagnoses for sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, are increasing in older adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports the number of people older than 65 diagnosed with chlamydia, gonorrhea or syphilis in the US increased about 3-, 5- and sevenfold, respectively, from 2010 to 2023. Data also suggests that women older than 50 are at greater risk for HIV than younger women.
Explanations for why these infections are so common in older adults include limited understanding of STIs in this age group, infrequent condom use and increased availability of medications for conditions that typically limit sexual activity in older adults, such as like Viagra and Cialis for erectile dysfunction and estrogen creams and tablets for vaginal dryness. Many older adults are reluctant to discuss their sexual history with their partners and health care providers, which contributes to misconceptions that they are monogamous or sexually inactive.
In my work as an infectious disease scientist, I examine the largely unexplored biological reasons for why postmenopausal women have increased susceptibility to STIs. My recently published research shows that menopause is associated with loss of the genital tract’s protective barrier, an essential defense against the microbial pathogens that cause STIs.
Menopause is the stage in a woman’s life marked by no menstrual periods for 12 consecutive months. In the US, menopause begins on average between ages 45 and 55. It is estimated that by the year 2030, 1.2 billion women worldwide will be menopausal or postmenopausal.
Menopause results from a loss of estrogen production from the ovaries, which can diminish vaginal lubrication and vaginal tissue elasticity. This can cause a condition called genitourinary syndrome of menopause, or GSM, which involves symptoms such as vaginal dryness and irritation, painful sex and frequent urinary tract infections. Roughly half of postmenopausal women experience GSM.
In addition to these negative effects on vaginal health, research from my lab has found that menopause also compromises the structural integrity of the tissue lining the vagina. The surface of the vagina is composed of multiple layers of epithelial cells that are held together by numerous adhesion molecules, including the proteins desmoglein-1, or DSG1, and desmocollin-1, or DSC1. These proteins strengthen the vaginal lining and restrict pathogen access to deeper tissue, reducing the risk of infection.
To explore how menopause affects the vaginal lining, we compared the DSG1 and DSC1 levels in vaginal tissue from postmenopausal and premenopausal women. We found significantly lower DSG1 and DSC1 levels in postmenopausal women.
We then surgically removed the ovaries of mice to model the loss of ovarian estrogen production in postmenopausal women. We also detected significantly less DSG1 and DSC1 proteins in vaginal tissue from mice without ovaries compared with mice with intact ovaries.
Mice without ovaries also had greater susceptibility to infection with herpes simplex virus type 2, or HSV-2, and were less able to clear chlamydia infection from their lower genital tract. On the other hand, applying estrogen cream to mice without ovaries restored the integrity of their vaginal lining and fully protected these mice from HSV-2 infection.
Fully understanding the behavioral and biological risk factors that contribute to STI susceptibility can help clinicians and public health officials tackle the startling increases in STIs among older adults.
Together, our studies show there is a loss of integrity in the vaginal lining after menopause. While additional research is needed, findings from our lab suggest that estrogen-containing compounds used to relieve vaginal irritation and other symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause can also reduce susceptibility to STIs among older adults.
In the meantime, health care providers can help reduce the risk of STIs among older adults by consistently counseling them about safe sex practices and offering routine STI screening.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/intestinal-ultrasound-for-ibd-clinical-practice-update-from-the-aga/,Intestinal Ultrasound for IBD: Clinical Practice Update From the AGA,"The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) released a clinical practice update in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology about the role of intestinal ultrasound (IUS) in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs).
The primary objectives in IBD management are to reverse endoscopically evident inflammation, maintain long-term remission, and to avoid complications. Treatment guidance in IBD relies largely on noninvasive biomarkers of inflammation, such as fecal calprotectin (FC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, as other more invasive monitoring approaches are burdensome and more costly.
In the United States (US), IUS has emerged in the last 3 years as a useful, noninvasive, radiation-free alternative to monitor IBD activity, whereas IUS has been used for more than a decade in Europe.
In general, IUS has a comparable accuracy with magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) and computerized tomography enterography (CTE) but does not require oral or intravenous contrast, can be performed in the clinical setting, does not emit radiation, and is less costly than other imaging modalities. Given the ability to deliver IUS in the gastroenterology clinic and at a lower cost, IUS has the potential to improve access to treat-to-target care. Furthermore, IUS requires less plastic and paper supplies than colonoscopy or MRE, making it a more environmentally friendly disease-monitoring approach.
The equipment needed for IUS comprises a high-resolution ultrasound system, low-frequency convex transducer, and high-frequency linear transducer. An IUS exam is conducted with an initial convex transducer global assessment of the bowel followed by a linear transducer assessment of disease activity. The primary outcomes of an IUS exam are bowel wall thickness (BWT) and bowel wall hyperemia.
More severe IBD is visualized with IUS by the presence of inflammatory mesenteric fat, loss of bowel wall stratification, and lymphadenopathy. Intestinal ultrasound can also be used to visualize abscesses, fistulae, phlegmons, sinus tracts, and strictures.
The clinical applications of IUS include screening to rule out or confirm IBD diagnosis and real-time monitoring of disease activity to adjust disease management. Intestinal ultrasound is most valuable for treating special patient populations, such as pregnant patients and patients with renal comorbidities who are not candidates for radiation-emitting and/or sedation-requiring procedures.
In Crohn disease (CD), previous studies have reported that resolution of IUS findings within 3 months of initiating biologic therapy indicated treatment response. Intestinal ultrasound findings were also found to predict treatment failure. In one study, patients with higher BWT at baseline were 42% less likely to achieve transmural healing a year after initiating treatment. Another study reported that a lack of IUS response at 4 weeks predicted poor endoscopic response at 48 weeks (negative predictive value [NPV], 73%).
In ulcerative colitis (UC), a study reported that BWT normalized as early as 2 weeks after switching treatment. Intestinal ultrasound outcomes were found to predict treatment response. One study reported that patients initiating tofacitinib who had an absolute BWT less than 2.8 mm were more likely to achieve endoscopic remission at week 8 (sensitivity, 73%; specificity, 100%; area under the curve [AUC], 0.87). Another study found that a 20% or more reduction in BWT within 48±24 hours after initiating intravenous corticosteroids increased the likelihood of endoscopic response (odds ratio [OR], 22.6; 95% CI, 4.2-201.2) and decreased the likelihood of requiring rescue treatment (OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.4-33.5).
The patient experience with IUS has been reported as favorable. Although patients stated they were willing to undergo invasive procedures, they preferred noninvasive approaches, such as IUS. Patients who received findings from IUS reported increased confidence in their decisions about disease management relative to those who received usual care.
However, IUS is not without limitations. It is less accurate for defining disease location or measuring the length of disease in the mild to proximal small bowel, for detecting inflammation in the proximal small bowel and rectum, it is not recommended for surveilling dysplasia, and outcomes can be affected by overlying bowel gas. The AGA stated that in the case of extensive small bowel CD, MRE was a more accurate imaging modality.
Currently, no official IUS certification for gastroenterologists has been established in the US. The International Bowel Ultrasound Group (IBUS) offers training and certification in IUS. The IBUS certification program comprises 3 modules and includes hands-on training with at least 40 patients.
“IUS has the potential to transform our current approach to diagnosis and monitoring of patients with IBD,” the guideline authors noted. “IUS objectively identifies treatment response, supporting a treat-to-target approach to IBD care. It can facilitate timely treatment adjustment and improve access to objective indicators of disease activity for special populations, such as pregnant patients, patients with comorbid serious diseases, and obese patients. Although IUS has some limitations, the value of IUS in diagnosing and monitoring IBD is comparable to established cross-sectional imaging modalities such as MRE and CTE.”

The rash is asymptomatic and he has no history of a similar rash. The rash is persistent with no aggravating or relieving factors noted. Mid-potency topical steroids and topical antifungals have offered no improvement. He does not use a heating pad on any areas involved by the rash. On examination, there are scaly hyperpigmented papules in a reticulated pattern scattered symmetrically on his chest, lower back, and bilateral axillae. The patient is otherwise healthy and takes no medications.
Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CARP), also referred to as confluent and reticulated papillomatosis of Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome, is a rare dermatosis typically affecting younger people and characterized by chronicity and frequent relapses.
French dermatologists Henri Gougerot and Alexandre Carteaud first described this entity in 1927 as “papillomatose pigmentée innominée,” meaning “unnamed pigmented papillomatosis.”1 After discovering additional cases of the same entity, in 1932, the dermatologists proposed the name “papillomatose confluente et réticulée,” which is translated to the English “confluent and reticulated papillomatosis.”2
CARP typically affects young people, with onset occurring often during puberty.3 Different studies have found male or female predominance in CARP, so it is unclear whether there is a true sex predilection. Racial predilection is also variable, depending on the study. Patients with CARP are often in good health; however, endocrinopathies such as diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, pituitary disorders, and abnormal menstruation have been associated with CARP.3
The disease presents as small papules that often become hyperkeratotic and verrucous.3 The disease classically involves the region between the breasts, superior abdomen, or interscapular region in a symmetric fashion.3 The papules tend to coalesce (confluent) in the midline trunk and are distributed in a net-like pattern (reticulated) at the periphery.3 In lighter skin colors, the papules are often flesh-colored to erythematous; in darker skin colors, the papules are usually hyperpigmented. However, a hypopigmented variant of CARP has been reported in patients with lighter skin.4 Symptoms can vary by patient, from asymptomatic to intensely pruritic.4
The histology of CARP demonstrates papillomatous acanthotic epidermis, hyperkeratosis, and mild perivascular lymphocytic inflammation.3 The histology of CARP is similar to the histology of acanthosis nigricans (AN), and these dermatoses can coexist in the same patient.4
The differential diagnosis of CARP includes erythema ab igne, tinea versicolor (TV), AN, Darier disease, and terra firma-forme.
Erythema ab igne also features a reticulated pattern and frequently affects the back, but erythema ab igne is not usually scaly and the net-like spaces are generally larger. A history of consistent exposure to a heating source (such as a heating pad, laptop, or space heater) definitively distinguishes erythema ab igne from CARP.
Tinea versicolor lesions are usually flat and ovoid with a fine, delicate scale, unlike the elevated and often hyperkeratotic lesions of CARP. Although both skin disorders favor the trunk, the precise areas of classic involvement are different; TV most commonly affects the chest, shoulders, neck, and upper back, whereas CARP commonly affects the intermammary region, interscapular region, and posterior neck.3
Acanthosis nigricans demonstrates thick plaques with a velvety texture, compared with the scaly reticulated papules of CARP. Both CARP and AN are associated with diabetes and obesity.3,5 Acanthosis nigricans is commonly found in the high-friction intertriginous zones, such as the neck and axillae; although CARP can involve the axillae and neck, the typical distribution also includes the chest and back.
Although familial cases of CARP have been rarely reported, it is typically an acquired disease.4 Darier disease, on the other hand, has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and therefore family history is extremely important when considering this disease. Like CARP, Darier disease often begins in younger people during puberty and involves seborrheic areas such as the chest and upper back.6 However, Darier disease is commonly seen on the face and scalp, which are atypical for CARP. Finally, histology easily distinguishes these 2 diseases. Darier disease demonstrates acantholytic dyskeratosis with corps ronds and grains, features that are totally absent in CARP.6
Terra firma-forme is a skin disorder wherein insufficient personal hygiene measures leads to buildup of the stratum corneum (retention hyperkeratosis). Concave areas of the face, neck, and trunk are commonly affected.7 However, the clinician may easily distinguish terra firma-forme from other skin disorders, as rubbing the plaques with 70% isopropyl alcohol swabs results in immediate resolution.3,7
Treatment of CARP can be difficult because there is no universally effective treatment strategy, and recurrences are common. Various oral antibiotics (especially tetracyclines), oral retinoids, topical keratolytics (such as lactic acid, salicylic acid, and urea), topical hydroquinone, and topical antifungals (such as selenium sulfide) are some of the therapies used for this disease. A course of doxycycline or minocycline for a few months is the most common treatment regimen for CARP and is effective (achieving lasting remission or extended disease-free state) in about half of patients.3,4
The patient in this case was diagnosed clinically with CARP and prescribed 100 mg of minocycline twice daily for 2 months. He experienced temporary remission of his disease with this treatment, but relapsed the following year requiring a repeat minocycline course.
A 28-year-old healthy man presents with a rash on his chest, back, and neck. The rash is asymptomatic with no pruritus, tenderness, or burning sensation. He has experienced several recurrences of this rash since childhood, usually during hot summers when he is frequently active outdoors and perspiring. The rash fades on its own as the weather becomes cooler. No household contacts have a similar rash. Hyperpigmented ovoid macules are present on the chest, back, and neck coalescing into patches, with a delicate overlying scale. On potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination of the scale, both rounded and wavy linear structures are appreciated.
Tinea versicolor, also called pityriasis versicolor, is a superficial cutaneous mycosis caused by Malassezia species. In this case, “tinea” is a misnomer because TV is not a dermatophyte infection. Malassezia organisms are dimorphic fungi; the yeast form is a commensal organism of the normal human skin microbiome but becomes pathogenic when it converts to the mycelial form.8,9
A pioneer in cutaneous diseases, English physician Robert Willan provided the first known description of TV in 1799 under the name “pityriasis versicolor.”10 German physician Carl Ferdinand Eichstedt elucidated the fungal etiology of the disease in 1846.10,11 In 1853, Charles Robin identified the specific organism and named it Microsporum furfur and changed the disease name to “tinea versicolor,” mistakenly believing it to be related to other dermatophyte infections.10-12 Subsequently, the organism was reclassified under the Malassezia genus as Malassezia furfur. More recently, other Malassezia species such as M. globosa, M. sympodialis, and M. restricta have also been implicated in TV.8,13
The disease presents as few to numerous ovoid macules and patches that often coalesce, favoring the upper trunk, shoulders, and neck. The lesions are covered in a fine, delicate scale, which is often better appreciated by gently scratching the skin. “Versicolor” reflects the propensity of TV to assume many different colors depending on the individual; erythematous, hypopigmented, or hyperpigmented presentations are the most common colors.8 The disease is usually asymptomatic or sometimes mildly pruritic.13 Patients should be advised that hyper- or hypopigmentation can persist for months even after adequate treatment.13
Tinea versicolor often occurs in warm, humid climates and during the summer season.8,13 The skin disorder is most frequently seen in adolescence to young adulthood, but all ages may be affected.13
Diagnosis is usually clinical, but in indeterminate cases a KOH examination or skin biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis. For KOH examination, some scale is painlessly scraped from the skin. Potassium hydroxide preparation helps to degrade keratinaceous debris and reveal the fungal organisms. On light microscopy, a mixture of hyphal and yeast structures resembling “spaghetti and meatballs” indicates the diagnosis of TV. On skin biopsy of TV, hyphal and yeast structures are observed in the stratum corneum.8
Tinea versicolor must be distinguished from clinical mimickers such as CARP, secondary syphilis, and seborrheic dermatitis.
Although CARP and TV both commonly feature confluence of lesions, CARP shows a reticulated pattern at the periphery of the confluent areas. The lesions of CARP are commonly papular, whereas the typical TV lesions are flat. Proliferation of Malassezia yeast and hyphae has been detected in a few CARP cases within lesional skin; however, most CARP cases lack this corneal “spaghetti and meatballs” (diagnostic of TV) and feature additional histologic features such as epidermal papillomatosis.3
Secondary syphilis lesions can be ovoid like those of TV, but lesions are often copper-colored and have a peripheral scale. Secondary syphilis lesions are often found on the posterior neck and lateral trunk, and palm and sole involvement is common.13 Unlike TV, secondary syphilis is often accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever and lymphadenopathy.13 Potassium hydroxide examination of syphilis scale will not reveal fungal yeast and hyphae. Positive rapid plasma reagin and histology with inflammation including plasma cells as well as positive immunostaining for spirochetes can also help distinguish secondary syphilis from TV.
Seborrheic dermatitis can affect the trunk, but more commonly affects the glabella, eyebrows, nasolabial folds, and scalp. The scale of seborrheic dermatitis is more yellow and greasy than the fine, delicate white scale of TV.
Treatment of TV is usually with topical or oral azoles, but other topical preparations may be used such as ciclopirox, selenium sulfide, and benzoyl peroxide.8,13 For milder cases or for maintenance treatments, topicals are the treatment of choice. For cases with extensive involvement, a short course of oral fluconazole or itraconazole is effective.8
The patient in this case was diagnosed clinically with TV and prescribed oral 200 mg of fluconazole daily for 5 days. He experienced significant improvement in his rash, but some hyperpigmentation persisted for several months after treatment. He was advised to use ketoconazole 2% shampoo weekly as a body wash to leave on for 5 minutes then rinse as maintenance treatment to prevent recurrence.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/breast-cancer-risk-in-female-healthcare-workers/,Importance of Radiation Exposure Control: Breast Cancer Risk in Female Healthcare Workers,"Breast cancer is the number one cause of cancer and second leading cause of cancer death in women. It affects 1 in 8 American women in their lifetime,1 and the incidence is increasing in all regions of the world, with invasive ductal carcinoma accounting for 55% of cases at diagnosis.2-4 Breast cancer development is a culmination of multiple risk factors: early menarche, nulliparity, late menopause, hormone replacement therapy, obesity, radiation exposure, alcohol consumption, family history, environmental exposures, and others.2 Although some breast cancers are related to heritable factors, the majority are not, making it crucial to identify and reduce other risk factors.
Radiation is a part of day-to-day life for many health care workers, particularly those in surgical specialties. This exposure can come from various avenues: radiographs, computed tomographic (CT) scans, nuclear medicine, and fluoroscopy procedures. Ionizing radiation leads to DNA damage and an increase in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). RONS are molecules derived from oxygen and nitrogen as by-products of cellular metabolism. Excessive production of these RONS can damage proteins, lipids, and DNA, leading to genomic instability. Also of note, DNA damage and RONS increase inflammation, leading to pro-carcinogenic effects and an environment that is more suitable for cancer proliferation in breast tissue.5
Although radiation exposure is a known risk factor for many types of cancer, the pathways of carcinogenesis related to hormones and ionizing radiation overlap in many ways. Because of this, the hormone sensitivity of breast tissue makes it even more susceptible to damage from ionizing radiation.5 Female  health care workers who are exposed to radiation in the workplace have been found to have a significantly increased risk for cancer. A study conducted by Chau et al included more than 500 female orthopedic surgeons and identified a 2.9-fold increase in breast cancer cases compared with the normal US female population.6
During surgeries that involve intraoperative imaging, all individuals in the operating room (OR) are exposed to direct and scatter radiation, with surgeons receiving the most direct radiation. As noted, radiation exposure leads to cellular damage through DNA alterations and the production of RONS. In some cases, cell death occurs. In others, neoplastic proliferation and genomic instability can occur.
These effects can be short or long term, and the risk for long-term effects increases with subsequent exposures. Deterministic effects of radiation are short-term effects that occur after a certain threshold is reached and are only worsened with subsequent exposures past that threshold. These thresholds are known and understood; therefore, deterministic effects can be controlled and the outcomes prevented with proper monitoring. Stochastic effects of radiation, however, are those that increase with each radiation exposure but without a specific threshold. They are more likely to occur with longer exposure or higher doses but can occur at any dose. Because of the lack of specific thresholds at which these effects occur, they cannot be prevented entirely. Carcinogenesis and teratogenesis are stochastic effects.7
Most patients with breast cancer have no symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Breast cancer is initially detected with screening mammography.1 Symptoms that patients may present with include breast pain, a palpable mass, nipple discharge (with or without a mass), asymmetric thickening or nodularity, skin changes, and axillary masses. Breast complaints are extremely common in women of all ages, although many complaints are a result of a benign process. The most common breast complaint is breast pain, which is not commonly indicative of cancer, followed by a palpable mass.1
Diagnosis of breast cancer most commonly begins with an abnormal finding on a screening mammogram. Screening mammography has been associated with a significant decrease in mortality in the United States (in conjunction with treatment advances). Those with a 20% or greater lifetime risk for breast cancer are also encouraged to undergo yearly breast magnetic resonance imaging.8
Screening mammograms are read and graded using the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).1 The BI-RADS first categorizes each mammogram based on breast composition.9 The mammographer then describes all pertinent findings, such as masses, asymmetry, architectural distortion, calcifications, and associated features. If any pertinent findings are present, further description of the findings will follow.10 The final assessment of the BI-RADS is subdivided into 7 categories (Table).9
Category 0, 3, or greater warrants short-interval follow-up, further imaging, and/or diagnostic studies as indicated by the recommendation for management.11 The recommendation for management is the final component of a BI-RADS report and is broken into 4 possible categories: need for additional imaging studies, routine interval mammography, short-term follow-up, or biopsy.9
Protection agencies and organizations regulate radiation exposure limits for medical professionals who are exposed to ionizing radiation. These policies vary from country to country but are typically based on recommendations from the International Commission on Radiological Protection and International Atomic Energy Agency. The current recommendations state that occupational exposure should be limited to a maximum of 20 mSv per year over a 5-year period. The recommendations also state that exposure in any single year should not exceed 50 mSv. For comparison, the general public is recommended to have less than 1 mSv per year over a 5-year period.11
Multiple studies and analyses have determined the upper outer quadrant of the breast as the most common site for all types of breast cancer.12-14 An analysis conducted in 2018 looked at more than 5000 breast cancer cases of which 36.2% involved only the upper outer quadrant of the breast. This does not account for the 24.7% of tumors that involved multiple quadrants.14
Radiation safety is vital in health care, and there are many techniques to reduce radiation-related health risks. These include:
Careful planning also can help reduce unnecessary or redundant radiation exposures. The use of proper technique and awareness can lessen the proximity and length of exposure to radiation sources. Adequate use of shields can physically limit radiation exposure.7

The use of new imaging modalities, techniques, and navigation systems have been a recent focus, particularly in spine surgery. Although these interventions and improvements are essential in reducing radiation exposure, they are costly and require a lot of training. Isocentric 3D C-arms are C-shaped CT systems used in many types of surgeries. C-arms can provide fluoroscopy, digital subtraction angiography, and 2D and 3D images. They have been shown to reduce radiation exposure to patients and OR personnel while providing equivalent or even superior images.7
The O-arm is another navigation system that has been proven to reduce radiation exposure to staff by allowing them to leave the OR when images are acquired.7 However, patients have higher levels of radiation exposure but still within acceptable limits. Overall, intraoperative CT navigation reduces radiation exposure to the surgeon and OR staff while improving procedure accuracy.15
Although optimizing imaging modalities is crucial in controlling radiation exposure, physical shielding with lead vests is also vital. For most people in an OR, it is not uncommon to see them grabbing any size or shape of lead vest before entering the OR. Whether this is because of a lack of resources or understanding of the necessity for properly fitting gear, these issues are easily addressed through mandatory training. The use of the proper shape and size of lead vests will not alter operating time, patient exposure, or surgical efficacy but would greatly benefit surgeons and all personnel within the OR.7
A study by the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center looked at the efficacy of different protective vests in preventing radiation exposure in female surgeons. The study simulated a female surgeon in 2 different positions, with 2 different C-arm positions and 5 different forms of protection using an anthropomorphic torso phantom. The investigators concluded that standard lead vests with or without wings are not sufficient to protect the breasts’ upper outer quadrant from radiation. They determined that lead sleeves and axillary supplements decreased radiation exposure more than standard lead vests with or without wings.16
Typical lead vests do not adequately protect axillary breast tissue, even in a vest that correctly fits the individual. An effort needs to be made to inform medical professionals of the risks of radiation exposure and how they can better protect themselves from exposure. Custom-fit lead vests that properly shield the upper outer quadrant and axillary regions of the breasts should become standard practice.
The rates of breast cancer are striking in female surgeons and other female health care workers who are exposed to radiation compared with the general population, and steps need to be taken to educate them and reduce this risk.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/search-seizure-in-the-hospital/,Search and Seizure in the Hospital: Do Constitutional Protections Apply?,"We have all seen TV shows where someone gets arrested and the police read the Miranda Rights: ‘You have a right to an attorney, anything you say may be used against you…’ But what if you are a hospital employee, and it’s not the police, but rather the hospital security that are doing the investigating and searching? Do you have any legal protections in that case?
The above scenario took place in a large hospital where Mr N, worked as a nurse. The hospital had its own internal security — called Protective Services. Protective Services ‘officers’ and ‘investigators’ maintained hospital security, enforced hospital rules, and investigated reports of wrongdoing.
The hospital also used Pyxis medication dispensing systems, which required an authorized user login before controlled substances could be removed from the medication cabinet. The system allowed users to cancel or override a medication checkout and return medication to the machine without reporting that medication had been taken.
One day, a nurse who worked in the same unit as Mr N reported to her supervisor that she had discovered a tampered vial of lorazepam in the Pyxis machine. Hospital staff, including Mr N’s supervisor, Ms S, examined the Pyxis machine and discovered an unusually high number of override commands that were cancelled by Mr N.
The following day, hospital staff noticed that Mr N had logged into a Pyxis machine even though he wasn’t currently working, or scheduled to be working, a shift at that time. That morning the Pyxis machine had been freshly stocked with new vials of lorazepam. When staff went to look at the machine following Mr N’s login, they discovered that the lorazepam vials appeared to have been tampered with and were not the ones originally placed in the medication cabinet.
Later that day when Mr N was working, a meeting was called. There were many attendees, some via Zoom, including the head of Protective Services and the Protective Services investigator, as well as Ms S, and administrative and human resources staff for the hospital. Attendees concluded that Mr N had something on his person and should be searched.
Ms S took Mr N to her office where Protective Services officers were waiting and asked him why he had accessed the Pyxis machine if he had not been working at that time. Mr N replied that he had been helping another nurse. Mr N then asked for an attorney.
The Protective Services officers ignored this and asked Mr N to empty his pockets on the table, which he did. His pockets contained syringes and flushes. Mr N was then informed that due to the circumstances, they intended to search his locker and backpack, as permitted by the hospital’s employee handbook.
Mr N protested, again asking for an attorney, and noted that they could not search his backpack due to “personal and privacy reasons.”
Throughout the experience, Mr N had been requesting an attorney, but was assured that he had representation with members of Human Resources present via Zoom.
Mr N was escorted to his locker and the contents were emptied into a clear bag and taken to the conference room, along with his backpack. A search of the contents revealed: 2 diazepam injections, 5 lorazepam vials, 1 hydromorphone vial, 6 vials of sterile water, 7 saline flushes, 19 syringes, 16 needles, and a bag with a crimper tool and numerous vial caps.
As the Protective Services staff photographed the evidence, Mr N told them that he had to take lorazepam ‘under the table’ to treat his anxiety because he could not have the drug on his medical record as a pilot.
The police were called and when the 2 officers arrived, they took over the investigation. The police searched and inventoried the evidence that had already been searched by hospital security. At some point, Mr N was read his Miranda warning, and declined to speak to the police. Mr N was ultimately placed under arrest for drug charges.
Mr N hired a criminal defense attorney who filed a motion to suppress the medications and Mr N’s statement to Protective Services at the hospital, arguing that they were illegally gained in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the US Constitution.
The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Fifth Amendment protects against self-incrimination. Miranda Warnings come from a 1960’s case – Miranda v. Arizona – where the Supreme Court instituted safeguards to inform criminal suspects of the protection against self-incrimination and the right to an attorney. However, these protections only apply to government actors, such as police, who are doing the questioning.
Mr N’s attorney argued the Protective Services security staff were effectively state actors, and thus their taking his statement and searching his property without a warrant was a violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The Court, however, disagreed.
While the Court did note that a private entity can qualify as a state actor in a few limited circumstances, it did not believe that was the case here. It noted that Protective Services staff had limited authority and could not make arrests.
As far as the search and seizure, when Mr N was hired and signed his employment contract, it was clear that there was no expectation of privacy to his locker and the employee handbook stated that lockers and backpacks were subject to search.
The Court refused to suppress the evidence — the statement and the medications — that Protective Services obtained from Mr N.
As an employee, you have very little expectation of privacy in the workplace. Lockers, backpacks, desk drawers, and so forth, are not places to keep anything that you want to remain private. If your employer has suspicions, they can look through your things.
Miranda warnings won’t protect you if you make an incriminating statement to someone who is NOT a police officer. Similarly, Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures only apply if it is a police officer doing the searching, not the private security of your employer.
The best way to protect yourself is to realize that you have no expectation of privacy at your place of business, so avoid ever bringing something in (or taking something out) that doesn’t belong.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/new-onset-diabetes-diagnostic-marker-pancreatic-cancer/,A Hidden Link: Disparities in New-Onset Diabetes as Diagnostic Marker for Pancreatic Cancer,"Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy. It is the third-most diagnosed cancer in the United States and the seventh-leading cause of cancer death worldwide.1 Its etiology is complex and not fully understood but is known to involve a vast array of inherited, modifiable, and nonmodifiable risk factors that cause damage or mutations to one’s DNA.2 These include diabetes mellitus, and in particular, recent-onset diabetes or new-onset diabetes (NOD).
The correlation between NOD and pancreatic cancer is believed to involve exacerbations in glucose intolerance resulting from cancer-induced tissue destruction.3 A recent study investigating this paraneoplastic phenomenon suggested that diabetes may be a marker for pancreatic cancer.3 Other publications support this notion, indicating that NOD could be a valuable element of pancreatic cancer screening tools.4 Of note, among clinical variables in patients with pancreatic cancer, a history of diabetes is directly and significantly related to a poor prognosis.5
Very few patients present with pancreatic cancer in its early stages due to a lack of symptoms. In more advanced stages, clinical findings may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, weight loss, jaundice, dark urine, and pale stools. The nonspecific nature of these symptoms underscores the need to identify predictors or markers for this malignancy and further study its relationship with diabetes.6
Diabetes occurs at varying prevalence rates in different racial and ethnic groups.6 A comprehensive review performed by the American Diabetes Association identified racial disparities, with Black American adults being 73% more likely to have diabetes and more likely to develop diabetes-related complications than their White counterparts.7 In addition to being predisposed to diabetes, Black Americans also have the greatest risk for developing pancreatic cancer compared with other racial groups.3
A study that used incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program for 2009 to 2018 showed that incidence rates for pancreatic cancer were highest amongst Black individuals (15.4/100,00) compared with non-Hispanic White (13.2/100,000) and Hispanic individuals (11.6/100,000).8 SEER data also indicate that Black patients have a slightly less favorable stage of cancer at diagnosis than White patients.9 Explanations for this involve a variety of social determinants of health related to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
A multiethnic cohort study was performed to analyze the correlation between NOD and the incidence of pancreatic cancer in 48,995 African American and Latino individuals—2 groups with known high risk for diabetes.3 The study found that the overall frequency of incident diabetes was significantly higher among those diagnosed with pancreatic cancer during the follow-up period (31.4%) compared with other cancers (colorectal, 16.4%; breast, 14.5%; prostate, 11.7%). In particular, NOD was more common in cases of pancreatic cancer (16.4%) than other cancers (colorectal, 6.7%; breast, 5.3%; prostate, 5.5%). Among patients with both pancreatic cancer and diabetes, more than half (52.3%) developed diabetes within the 36 months before their cancer diagnosis.3 The study concluded that those with NOD were at greater risk for developing cancer than those with long-term diabetes and identified a 2-fold increased risk for pancreatic cancer in African American and Latino populations with NOD.3
No methods for screening or early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer have been established for the general population. Rather, such screening is geared only toward high-risk populations, such as those with a family history of pancreatic cancer, including first-degree relatives; inherited genetic syndromes associated with pancreatic cancer, like Peutz-Jehghers syndrome, Lynch syndrome, BRCA mutations, or hereditary pancreatitis; and those with a history of benign pancreatic tumors or cysts.10 Current recommendations from the American Gastroenterology Association indicate that screening for these high-risk individuals should begin at 50 years of age or 10 years younger than the age of familial onset.11 These parameters leave out the many patients who could still develop pancreatic cancer.
Some researchers assert that intermittent assessment in patients with any risk factors for pancreatic cancer could have positive effects on putative screening results.12 These risks include NOD and chronic pancreatitis, as well as modifiable factors like cigarette smoking, alcohol use, obesity, and poor diet. Ongoing research on the development of screening models can significantly contribute to early detection. One example, developed by Sharma et al, evaluates changes in weight and blood glucose and age at onset of NOD, as these 3 features were found to distinguish NOD in pancreatic cancer from type 2 NOD.13 The tool calculates a score that categorizes patients as at high, intermediate, or low risk for pancreatic cancer, allowing for further workup to be considered for those in the high-risk category. Although not used actively in clinical care, this model and others may help bring some overlooked patients to the forefront.
Currently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends the use of endoscopic ultrasonography for high-risk patients with familial pancreatic cancer.12 Other applicable imaging methods include computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography/CT, and transabdominal ultrasound, with CT being the initial test of choice for pancreatic cancer in the clinical setting. A workup for pancreatic cancer also involves laboratory assessments of complete blood count, liver function, and serum levels of CA 19-9, an FDA-approved tumor marker. This marker is commonly used in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and is valuable in symptomatic patients; however, it lacks specificity for pancreatic cancer, as it can be elevated in other conditions as well. Combining CA 19-9 with additional biomarkers and diagnostic tools can enhance its predictive value.14
Overall, there remains a lack of standardized recommendations for screening individuals with diabetes for pancreatic cancer. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly vital for practitioners to be mindful of patients who present with possible risk factors such as NOD. This is particularly true for high-risk demographics.5

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/reducing-the-risk-of-cvd-in-patients-with-hiv/,Reducing the Risk of CVD in Patients with HIV,"Cardiovascular complications are among the most common comorbidities affecting people with HIV (PWH), with studies showing increased risk for myocardial infarction, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death in these individuals despite treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART).1 Compared with people without HIV, PWH have demonstrated up to twice the risk for cardiovascular disease,2 and this difference is not clearly linked to traditional risk factors or ART.1
While further research is needed to elucidate the nature of CVD in HIV, recent study findings offer hope regarding strategies to reduce the risk for CVD in this patient population. The phase 3 REPRIEVE (Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02344290) was the first large trial to test a CVD prevention strategy in PWH (n=7,769).3,4
According to the results, reported in August 2023 in the New England Journal of Medicine, the risk for a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was significantly lower among patients who received a daily dose of pitavastatin calcium compared with those receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48-0.90; P =.002).3
To discuss the clinical implications of these findings and other points regarding CVD among PWH, Cardiology Advisor interviewed Steven Grinspoon, MD, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief of the Massachusetts General Hospital Metabolism Unit in Boston and co-PI of the REPRIEVE trial, as well as Matthew J Feinstein, MD, MSc, associate professor of medicine in the division of cardiology and director of the Clinical and Translational Immunocardiology Program at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, Illinois.
Dr Grinspoon: CVD occurs among PWH who may be younger, as well as those with only moderate traditional cardiovascular risks.5,6 Research has suggested that both traditional and nontraditional risk factors contribute to CVD in PWH. For example, in addition to the risk related to excess smoking and traditional factors, PWH experience long-term increased immune activation and inflammation, even in the context of successful ART. These factors may contribute to collateral damage to multiple organ systems, including increased premature atherogenesis.6
Dr Feinstein: The elevated CVD risk in PWH remains after multivariable adjustment for demographic and clinical factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.6 A key proposed mechanism underlying this increased risk is chronic, nonresolving inflammation. This inflammatory burden is particularly notable in people with HIV who have low current or nadir/historical CD4+ T cell counts—especially if below 200 cells/mm^3)—as this reflects a shift in their immune repertoire that generally portends impaired inflammation-regulating immune responses and more vulnerability to sustained, unregulated inflammatory responses.
Apart from chronic inflammation, other coinciding comorbidities—such as tobacco smoking, which is more common in PWH than people without HIV—add to the burden of CVD. Some ART-related side effects, including lipid abnormalities, may also play a role, although data support continuous viral suppression on ART as clearly having benefit both overall and from a cardiovascular risk reduction standpoint for PWH.7
Dr Grinspoon: Physicians should always start with a focus on healthy lifestyle and reducing or minimizing traditional risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and poor diet. In addition, the use of successful ART to reduce inflammation is helpful, though residual inflammation and immune activation persist, as previously noted above. However, even with this focus, many PWH are vulnerable to excess CVD.
Dr Feinstein: The first step is awareness, and we’re getting there. Physicians being aware that their patients with HIV may have a higher risk than otherwise expected for CVD is essential. This can inform primary prevention and thorough risk assessments, as well as ensure physicians have a high index of suspicion to investigate for overt CVD in the presence of potentially suggestive symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath.
Based on emerging data from the REPRIEVE trial, it also appears that PWH may receive more than expected CVD risk-reducing benefit from statin therapy, which may lead to lower thresholds to consider statin therapy for CVD prevention in our patients with HIV.3
Dr Grinspoon: The recently completed REPRIEVE trial suggests a further emphasis should be placed on the use of a statin strategy, even among those with low-to-moderate CVD risk, among whom statins are not often prescribed. In the REPRIEVE study, PWH aged 40 to 75 years with low-to-moderate traditional risk, as calculated by the ACC/AHA pooled cohort equation, were randomized to pitavastatin or placebo and followed over 5 years.3
We observed a 35% reduction in MACE in the treatment group vs placebo. The reduction in MACE was larger than anticipated from reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) alone, suggesting additional effects of statin on non-traditional pathways, such as inflammatory pathways. Further analyses are ongoing in this regard.3
These results were achieved in a global trial of over 7,500 participants, covering high and low Global Burden of Disease (GBD) regions and including a diverse population, including women and a large portion of non-White participants. The effects were seen to be robust and similar in major subgroups, including by age, sex, and GBD region. Safety was reasonable, with anticipated effects on low-grade muscle aches and diabetes.3
Importantly, the protective effects in terms of heart attacks and strokes were seen even among the small group with diabetes. The data from REPRIEVE suggest that PWH with low-to-moderate traditional risk should be placed on a statin therapy and that this will prevent heart attacks and strokes and will save lives.3
Dr Feinstein: The REPRIEVE trial data are fascinating and add a lot to our understanding of this issue. The number 1 takeaway is that we see a larger-than-expected reduction in CVD risk than what we’d expect in a non-HIV population.3 In clinical trials in the general population, the amount of statin-related LDL-lowering achieved in REPRIEVE—a little less than 1 mmol/L on average—would be expected to reduce CVD events by about 20%, give or take.
Yet, this level of on-statin LDL reduction yielded a robust 35% CVD risk reduction in PWH in REPRIEVE. This tells us that the benefit of statins—or at least pitavastatin, though I would anticipate there is a broader class effect here—in CVD risk reduction for PWH may be especially strong. As a result, for individuals with HIV in whom we are considering statin therapy, these results help tip the balance in favor of benefit relative to risk.3
Dr Grinspoon: We need to understand why the effects of statins were so robust in REPRIEVE and which inflammatory and other pathways were modulated. We need to educate PWH on the risk of CVD, a risk that is occurring even in young PWH without significant traditional risks. We need to implement these results and educate PWH on the benefits of this strategy, and we need to be sure this is accompanied by a focus on healthy lifestyle as well.
Dr Feinstein: Remaining questions include whether even more potent lipid-lowering will continue to increase CVD risk reduction in people with HIV—for instance, beyond 35% and even up to 50% with more significant LDL lowering. Other questions relate to whether this higher-than-expected risk reduction is a direct anti-inflammatory effect of statins, or whether it’s simply a result of reducing LDL levels in a population (PWH) in which the response to each additional unit of harmful lipid may be especially inflammatory.
Of course, there are a number of implementation-related questions that will be important to tease out. These include investigating when the right time is to initiate statin therapy. On one hand, a risk-based approach is reasonable, as we do in the general population where those at higher absolute risk for CVD are the ones that derive the highest absolute benefit in the near-to-medium term from CVD risk-reducing therapies. Yet, on the other hand, there may be a biological argument related to early initiation of statins before substantial plaque has an opportunity to get a foothold and then drive persistent, unresolving inflammation.
There will be no easy answer to this question in the near-term, so at a minimum it is important that clinicians remember these 3 things:

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/emergency-care-ischemic-stroke-an-overview-of-current-guidelines-and-future-directions/,Emergency Care of Ischemic Stroke: An Overview of Current Guidelines and Future Directions,"Every year, nearly 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke; of these approximately 610,000 are new strokes.1 The approach to emergency stroke management (ESM) is widely researched, with guidelines updated regularly by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA), most recently in 2021 and 2022.2-6 However, to provide the best, most efficient care, clinicians need to be kept apprised of the latest evidence-based treatments that emerge between published guideline updates.
The AHA/ASA has developed a program, “Get With the Guidelines®-Stroke” (GWTG-S), that is a warehouse of evidence-based tools, resources, and trends meant to keep clinicians up to date on the latest information and promoting guideline use. The program states: “Following evidence-based guidelines improves outcomes. These tools and resources make it easier to provide consistent quality care.” GWTG-S provides several avenues of support to hospitals, researchers, clinicians, and patients including but not limited to access to the most up-to-date research, professional education (continuing education, workshops, and webinars), patient education, Qi field staff support, submission of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Core Stroke Measures and other data, and performance feedback through the GWTG-S registry for continuous quality improvement.4
Being on the front line of ESM, emergency medicine physician assistants (EM-PAs) are often one of the first clinicians to evaluate a stroke patient and call the “stroke alert.” It is of utmost importance that EM-PAs are up to date on the most recent AHA/ASA guidelines regarding recognition of stroke symptoms, treatment for ischemic stroke, endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), intravenous thrombolytic intervention, and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).2
Treatment of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) begins with recognition of stroke symptoms and activating a stroke alert. Recognition and analysis of stroke symptoms most often begins in the prehospital setting when either the patient or family notices they are having symptoms.
Originally developed in the United Kingdom in 1998 by stroke physicians for use by ambulance staff, the Face, Arm, Speech, Time (FAST) scale is based on its predecessors, the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS) and Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS). The scale has since been promoted by the AHA/ASA in public campaigns to educate laypeople about stroke prevention, recognition, and prompt engagement of the prehospital emergency system.7,8
The FAST scale is only for assessing the presence of stroke symptoms, not the severity, but as the name implies, there are only 4 items to be assessed and can be learned in about 10 minutes7,8:
Other symptoms to be noted include numbness of the face or extremities (especially if unilateral), confusion including difficulty with speaking or understanding speech, vision change in one or both eyes, trouble walking (dizziness, balance, or coordination), and severe headache without cause or history of headaches.8
Several tools exist for emergency medical service (EMS) providers for initial screening and severity scales for assessing symptoms of large vessel occlusion (LVO). This blockage is treated with tPA or EVT, unless the patient is not a candidate for tPA. The most accurate and widely used prehospital screening tool is the LAPSS, which has 91% specificity and 97% sensitivity for screening LVO in the field, followed by CPSS (73%-89%), and Rapid Arterial Occlusion Evaluation (RACE; 68%-85%).9 The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Field Assessment Stroke Triage for Emergency Destination (FAST-ED) are used in the prehospital setting for decision making of transportation directly to an advanced care Comprehensive Stroke Center, bypassing other more basic stroke care or transporting to the closest Acute Stroke Ready Hospital or Primary Stroke Center.10
The gold-standard screening tool for in-hospital assessment is the NIHSS; however, in the prehospital setting this and other severity scales have given way to increasing use of the FAST-ED. The consensus between the most recent studies is that additional research is needed.11
The FAST-ED was developed from, and is an abbreviated form of, the NIHSS that includes scoring for eye deviation and neglect, which evaluates for both posterior and anterior LVO. Only a few small studies have examined the accuracy and applicability of the FAST-ED (Table), but the consensus is a high sensitivity (60%-80%) with variable specificity (47.7%-89%).11-13 It has become more widely used than other scales in the prehospital setting because it is briefer than the NIHSS, yet maintains high specificity and sensitivity while including posterior LVO evaluation.10-13
The importance of early detection of LVO is related to decision making and EMS transportation to the most appropriate facility for definitive treatment with EVT. Definitive treatment for ischemic stroke is tPA or EVT. Not all hospitals have the capability of EVT; therefore, a decision needs to be made quickly in the field as to the facility with the most resources for EVT, considering time of “last known well,” severity of symptoms, and transport time to reduce time-to-intervention. Several studies for assessment of and creation of prehospital protocols for EMS have been done with demonstration that there is feasibility for a countrywide EMS protocol using decision-making scales.14
The AHA/ASA published an update in 2019 to the 2018 “Guidelines for Early Management of Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke,” which was comprehensive in managing the triage, imaging, and treatment of acute ischemic stroke, including algorithms for each step of stroke treatment.15 Several recent studies have been highlighted by the GWTG-S program in 2022 that focused on tPA or EVT.16
The enzyme tPA was discovered in 1946 in Denmark, but it wasn’t until the mid-1970s that it began to be studied in animal models as a blood clot dissolving agent.17 Between the 1950s and 1990s, streptokinase and urokinase were the common thrombolytics of the day, but had the drawback of causing significant internal hemorrhage. In the 1980s, multiple clinical trials showed the success with tPA in patients with myocardial infarction, and for treating stroke in animal models, when used early in treatment, with improved outcomes. Alteplase was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating myocardial infarction by 1987; however, it was not until 1995 when the FDA approved tPA for ischemic stroke.17
Current guidelines state that tPA must be given no longer than 4.5 hours after the last known time the patient was without symptoms. To meet certain inclusion criteria, the patient must be evaluated for a list of contraindications and relative contraindications to tPA administration.15 Several studies have evaluated tenecteplase as an alternative to alteplase that show a similar safety profile (no significant differences in rate of intracranial hemorrhage or parenchymal hemorrhage or other serious extracranial adverse events) with lower door-to needle time with tenecteplase because it is more easily prepared.18
The 2018 and 2019 updated EVT guidelines increased the window for thrombectomy from 6 up to 24 hours in selected patients.15 The GWTG-S program features research of EVT with most supporting the current 2019 guidelines and a few exploring the expansion of EVT in other populations such as patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO) or those older than 80 years of age.19,20
The Joundi et al study19 examined 3015 patients with BAO who underwent EVT. They followed the outcomes in patients presenting within 24 hours and concluded that outcomes were significantly better for those treated “within” 6 hours than those treated after 6 hours. These findings support EVT guidelines for anterior LVO instead of BAO and encourage quality improvement with workflow and shorter time to EVT treatment.
Adcock et al20 was a very large cohort study (302,965 patients) that studied the frequency of EVT and outcomes in patients 80 years of age and older. The findings of the study showed a marked increase of frequency of EVT from 3.3% to 20.8% between 2012 to 2019; however, outcomes at discharge were worse than younger patients with low functional independence, death, or discharge to hospice.
Although the Joundi and Adcock studies are not promoting novel treatment, they are asking questions that with additional research could lead to new guidelines and are exploring ideas that are important to supporting the mission of the GWTG-S program, which is evidence-based quality improvement in emergent stroke treatment.
Staying up to date with current guidelines and upcoming advances in ESM and ensuring evidence-based quality care with hospital-based quality improvement initiatives has been made much easier by the AHA/ASA GWTG-S program.21 Not only does the program serve as a warehouse of research for advancement in current treatment modalities, but it also looks to the future.
Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and augmented reality are all poised to take stroke care to the next level. Dresser and Kohn22 briefly explain how AI can advance stoke care: “By analyzing and combining clinical, laboratory, and imaging information, AI can give individualized recommendations for the best therapy to treat stroke and provide prognostic information for functional outcomes. This technology is also being used to assist with stroke rehabilitation.”
The future of ESM continues to build from the current guidelines, all with the common goal of reducing door-to-needle times and reducing morbidity and mortality from acute ischemic stroke. However, there is more work to be done with additional research of current treatment modalities and the rapid rise of biotechnology integration regarding stroke recognition, thrombolysis, and EVT.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/ats-guideline-targets-post-adenotonsillectomy-pediatric-osa/,ATS Pediatric OSA Guideline Targets Post-Adenotonsillectomy Apnea in Children,"The American Thoracic Society (ATS) has released a practice guideline targeting post-adenotonsillectomy (AT) obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children. The guideline was published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.
The guideline applies to children aged younger than 18 years who have persistent OSA, regardless of race, comorbidities, or other demographic characteristics, and is the first guideline in this population. Persistent OSA was defined as an obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (oAHI) of 1 or more event/hour.
The guideline includes recommendations on 6 areas related to managing children with persistent OSA:
An international panel of 13 specialists in otolaryngology, dentistry, pediatric sleep medicine, plastic surgery, and nursing who had expertise in pediatric OSA developed the guidelines using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
The panel initially proposed 16 key questions in the patient, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) format, and 6 were ultimately selected to be addressed. Panel members conducted a literature search for each key question in Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Eligible studies included at least 10 patients, of whom at least 75% were post-AT.
In its first recommendation, the guideline suggests that children who have persistent OSA and do not qualify for site-specific upper airway treatment may be candidates for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in estimates of the effect).
A drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) with other imaging modalities can be considered if CPAP is not desired, when adherence is poor, or when surgically modifiable sites of airway obstruction are suspected, according to the guideline panel. The recommendation prioritizes the need to identify upper airway abnormalities that are amenable to surgery or orthodontic care.
Clinicians are advised to determine the need for an in-laboratory titration study compared with empiric autoadjusting CPAP therapy in cases when CPAP is used. Regular downloading of CPAP data is recommended to assess adherence, and clinical visits are advised for evaluating facial appearance/growth and side effects. Patients should have intensive follow-up assessment during the first weeks after initiation, according to the panel.
Studies have reported improvement in OSA severity in children who use CPAP, and other research has shown significant improvements in school performance and a reduction in daytime somnolence among children with persistent OSA who use CPAP. Rare side effects may include facial ulcers and facial deformities.
The cost of CPAP may be significant, as treatment is long term; however, CPAP may be cost-effective if it is the only viable treatment option, the panel noted.
More research is needed regarding short- and long-term adherence to treatment and what is acceptable adherence in children. Large, multicenter studies are needed for outcomes such as quality of life, mood, weight changes, cognitive function, and behavioral changes, and additional research should include the long-term effects of CPAP masks on facial growth and use of custom masks.
As recommendation #2, the guideline suggests that children with persistent OSA and specific craniofacial features may be candidates for orthodontic/dentofacial orthopedic treatment (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in estimates of the effect). These children also should have an indication for orthodontic treatment based on a constricted maxilla (high and narrow palate, posterior crossbite), and rapid maxillary expansion (RME) may be the preferred treatment, according to the panel.
Children with persistent OSA should be assessed for maxillary constriction and referred to an orthodontist or dentofacial specialist for ongoing care when a deficiency is suspected, which is generally most appropriate between ages 6 and 13 years, the panel advises. Among children with maxillary constriction, RME has been associated with improvement in children with persistent OSA after AT.
Transient effects of RME may involve alterations in tongue and lip function, difficulty in drinking quickly, and speech difficulty, and tolerance difficulties in children with behavioral issues. Because RME is generally regarded as a dental intervention, medical insurance usually will not cover the cost, although dental insurance may. The initial costs for care with an orthodontist may be high.
Comparative effectiveness studies are needed to evaluate the effects in children with and without maxillary constriction, as are future studies with outcome measurements that include quality of life, behavioral changes, mood, daytime sleepiness, and weight changes, as well as a cost-effectiveness analysis.
In recommendation #3, the guideline suggests that children with obesity and persistent OSA have weight loss intervention (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in estimates of the effect). The panel suggests using weight-loss interventions including diet, exercise, and behavioral modification as part of a multidisciplinary weight-loss program for obese children with persistent OSA. In cases in which weight loss is not achieved, consideration should be made for surgical weight loss for eligible children, according to the panel.
The effects of weight loss in treating persistent OSA in children are uncertain, as there are no studies in this population. Observational studies that evaluated the effect of medical or surgical weight loss in children with OSA who had not undergone AT found that weight loss led to resolution of OSA and improved AHI. The potential long-term benefits need to be weighed against the costs associated with the interventions, the panel advised.
As recommendation #4, the guideline suggests that children with lingual tonsillar hypertrophy (LTH) and persistent OSA may be candidates for lingual tonsillectomy (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in estimates of the effect).
Research has found that lingual tonsillectomy is associated with improvement in AHI in most children, although studies have used polysomnography (PSG) as the main outcome measure and have not included quality of life and behavior measures.
This recommendation prioritizes the need to identify LTH in children who have persistent OSA, especially when risk factors such as Down syndrome are present, which can be done with awake nasopharyngoscopy, DISE, or imaging.
Studies have found that lingual tonsillectomy leads to improvement of OSA, although complete resolution of OSA (AHI <1) has infrequently been shown and most children will have less severe but persistent OSA after lingual tonsillectomy, according to the panel. Adverse effects of lingual tonsillectomy can include bleeding, voice changes, and reduced oral intake. Children who are overweight or obese or those who have Down syndrome are likely to have the least amount of improvement after lingual tonsillectomy. Long-term data are needed for outcomes of lingual tonsillectomy.
In recommendation #5, the guideline suggests that children with sleep-dependent laryngomalacia and persistent OSA may be candidates for supraglottoplasty (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in estimates of the effect).
The recommendation prioritizes the need to identify obstruction at the level of the supraglottis (sleep-dependent or congenital laryngomalacia) with use of DISE in children who have persistent OSA. Limited research has found improvement in OSA severity (AHI and oxygen saturation) after supraglottoplasty. Adverse effects of supraglottoplasty such as dysphagia generally are generally transient and minor.
Some children with dysphagia, including those with a high risk of aspiration, may not benefit from supraglottoplasty, and this complication should be part of shared decision-making, according to the panel. The ability to swallow safely should be evaluated before discharge, and speech swallow assessment may be needed if persistent. More data are needed on the use of supraglottoplasty in children with persistent OSA, the panel noted.
In recommendation #6, the guideline suggests that children with persistent OSA who are taking intranasal steroids may be treated with montelukast (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in estimates of the effect).
The panel recommends a treatment course for as long as 12 weeks if other treatment interventions are not available. In addition, the children should be closely monitored for potential behavior and mood-related changes, and PSG may be considered if symptoms of OSA continue after the end of treatment.
No studies have reported on the effects of montelukast on oAHI when it is coadministered with intranasal steroids vs use of intranasal steroids only. A small study found favorable effects of the drug combination on AHI compared with no treatment among children with mild persistent OSA. Reported outcomes have not included OSA resolution frequency, quality of life, OSA-related morbidity, or snoring.
The US Food and Drug Administration has recommended that montelukast’s benefits may not outweigh the risks, particularly in cases of mild disease symptoms that can be treated effectively with other medications. Intranasal steroids with or without montelukast may be preferred as an intervention to lower the severity of persistent OSA vs CPAP or other surgical interventions, according to the panel.
The cost for combining intranasal steroids and montelukast for 12 weeks may be high for some families, especially if they are not covered by insurance. Randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy of intranasal steroids with and without the combined effects of montelukast, the panel noted.
“Clinicians confronted with children with persistent OSA should personalize treatment decisions based on symptoms, relative benefits vs risks, and medical comorbidity, as suggested by these recommendations,” the panel stated. “Some treatment options with potential clinical benefit (eg, maxillomandibular surgery) in pediatric persistent OSA were not addressed in this guideline. This and other treatment interventions, such as hypoglossal nerve stimulation, high-flow nasal cannula, and myofunctional therapy, as well as other pertinent new evidence that may become available, will be addressed in a future update by the committee.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/fda-authorized-alternatives-weight-loss-drugs/,Why Millions Are Trying FDA-Authorized Alternatives to Big Pharma’s Weight Loss Drugs,"KFF Health News — Pharmacist Mark Mikhael, PharmD has lost 50 pounds over the past 12 months. He no longer has diabetes and finds himself “at my ideal body weight,” with his cholesterol below 200 for the first time in 20 years. “I feel fantastic,” he said.
Like millions of others, Mikhael credits the new class of weight loss drugs. But he isn’t using brand-name Wegovy or Zepbound. Mikhael, CEO of Orlando, Florida-based Olympia Pharmaceuticals, has been getting by with his own supply: injecting himself with copies of the drugs formulated by his company.
He’s far from alone. Mikhael and other industry officials estimate that several large compounding pharmacies like his are provisioning up to 2 million American patients with regular doses of semaglutide, the scientific name for Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, Ozempic, and Rybelsus formulations, or tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound and Mounjaro.
The drug-making behemoths fiercely oppose that compounding business. Novo Nordisk and Lilly lump the compounders together with internet cowboys and unregulated medical spas peddling bogus semaglutide, and have high-powered legal teams trying to stop them. Novo Nordisk has filed at least 21 lawsuits nationwide against companies making purported copies of its drugs, said Brianna Kelley, a spokesperson for the company, and urges doctors to avoid them. The FDA, too, has cautioned about the potential danger of the compounds, and leading obesity medicine groups starkly warn patients against their use.
But this isn’t an illegal black market, though it has shades of gray.
The FDA allows and even encourages compounding pharmacies to produce and sell copycats when a drug is in short supply, and the wildly popular GLP-1 drugs have enduring shortages — first reported in March 2022 for semaglutide and in December 2022 for tirzepatide. The drugs have registered unprecedented success in weight loss. They are also showing promise against heart, kidney, and liver diseases and are being tested against conditions as diverse as Alzheimer disease and drug addiction.
In recent years, the US health care system has come to depend on compounding pharmacies, many of which are run as nonprofits, to plug supply holes of crucial drugs like cancer medicines cisplatin, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil.
Most compounded drugs are old, cheap generics. Semaglutide and tirzepatide, on the other hand, are under patent and earn Novo Nordisk and Lilly billions of dollars a year. Sales of the diabetes and weight loss drugs this year made Novo Nordisk Europe’s most valuable company and Lilly the world’s biggest pharmaceutical company.
While the companies can’t keep up with demand, they heatedly dispute the right of compounders to make and sell copies. Lilly spokesperson Kristiane Silva Bello said her company was “deeply concerned” about “serious health risks” from compounded drugs that “should not be on the market.”
Yet marketed they are. Even Hims & Hers Health — the telemedicine prescriber that got its start with erectile dysfunction drugs — is now peddling compounded semaglutide. It ran ads for the drugs during NBA playoff games. (According to a Hunterbrook Media report, Hims & Hers’ semaglutide supplier has faced legal scrutiny.)
The compounded forms are significantly cheaper than the branded drugs. Patients pay about $100 to $450 a month, compared with list prices of roughly $1,000 to $1,400 for Lilly and Novo Nordisk products.
Five compounders and distributors interviewed for this article said they conduct due diligence on every lot of semaglutide or tirzepatide they buy or produce, upholding standards of purity, sterility, and consistency similar to those practiced in the commercial drug industry. Compounders operate under strict federal and state standards, they noted.
However, the raw materials used in the compounded forms may differ from those produced for Novo Nordisk and Lilly, said GLP-1 co-inventor Jens Juul Holst, of the University of Copenhagen, adding that care must be taken in drug production lest it cause potentially harmful immune reactions.
To date, according to FDA spokespeople, reports of side effects from taking compounded versions haven’t raised major alarms. But everyone with knowledge of the industry, including the compounders themselves, worry that a single batch of a poorly made drug could kill or maim people and destroy confidence in their business.
“I liken the compounding industry to the airline industry,” Mikhael said. “When you have an airline crash, it hurts everybody.”
The industry endured just such a catastrophe in 2012, when the New England Compounding Center released a contaminated injectable steroid that killed at least 64 people and harmed hundreds more.
In response, Congress and the FDA had strengthened oversight. Mikhael’s company is an outsourcing facility, or 503B compounding pharmacy — so-named for a section of the 2013 law that set new requirements for drug compounders. The companies are licensed to make slightly different versions of FDA-approved drugs in response to shortages or a patient’s special needs.
The law created 2 classes of compounding pharmacies: The FDA regulates the larger 503B compounders with standards like commercial drug companies, while 503A pharmacies make smaller lots of drugs and are largely overseen by state boards of pharmacy.
The 503A facilities also are producing compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide for hundreds of thousands of patients. Like the 503Bs, these operations take the active ingredient, produced as a powder in FDA-registered factories, mostly in China, then reconstitute it with sterile water and an antimicrobial in small glass vials.
Together, the compounding pharmacies may account for up to 30% of the semaglutide sold in the US, Mikhael said, although he cautions that is a “wild ballpark figure” since no one, including the FDA, is tracking sales in the industry.
The compounders say the companies should increase production if they’re worried about competition. Like the dozens of other drugs they produce for hospitals and medical practices, the compounders say, the 2 diet drugs are essential products.
“If you don’t want a 503B facility to make a copy, it’s pretty simple: Don’t go short,” said Lee Rosebush, chair of a trade association for 503B pharmacies. “FDA created this system because these are necessary drugs.”
Novo Nordisk hasn’t specified why it can’t keep up with demand, but the bottleneck apparently lies in the company’s inability to fill and sterilize enough of its special drug auto-injectors, said Evan Seigerman, a managing director at BMO Capital Markets.
The company announced June 24 that it was investing $4.1 billion in new production lines at its Clayton, North Carolina, site. The FDA last year issued a warning over procedural violations at the site and separate cautions at an Indiana facility that Novo Nordisk took over recently.
At least 28 companies mostly in China, are registered with the FDA to produce or distribute semaglutide. At least half the companies have entered the market in the past 12 months, driving the raw material’s price down by 35%, according to Scott Welch, who runs a 503A pharmacy in Arlington, Virginia.
Compounders can buy powdered semaglutide from some U.S. distributors for less than $4000 a gram, said Matthew Johnson, president and CEO of distributor Pharma Source Direct. That comes out to as little as $10 per weekly 2.5-microgram dose – not including overhead and other costs.
While Ozempic or Wegovy patients use a Novo Nordisk device to inject the drug, patients using compounded products draw them from a vial with a small needle, like the device diabetics use for insulin.
Some medical practices provide the compounded drug to patients as part of a weight loss package, with markups. Last July, Tabitha Ries, a single mother of 6 who works as a home health care aide in Garfield, Washington, found an online clinic that charged her $1000 for 3 months of semaglutide along with counseling. She has lost 35 pounds.
She gets the drug from Mindful Weight Loss, a mostly telehealth-based operation led by physician Vivek Gupta of Manhattan Beach, California. Gupta said he’s prescribed the weight loss drugs to 1500 patients, with about 60% using compounded versions from a 503A pharmacy.
He hasn’t seen any essential difference in patients using the branded and compounded forms, although “some people say the compounding is a little less effective,” Gupta said.
There’s some risk in using the non-FDA-approved product, he acknowledged, and he requires patients to sign an informed consent waiver.
“Nothing in life is without risk, but I would also argue that the status quo is not safe for people who need the medicine and can’t get it,” he said. “They’re constantly triggered by all this food that’s causing their weight to go up and their sugar to go high, increasing their insulin resistance and affecting their limbs and eyes.”
Compounding semaglutide is a helpful sideline for pharmacists like him, Welch said, especially given the pinch on drug sale revenue that has led many independents to close in recent years. He figures he earns 95% of his revenue from compounding drugs, rather than traditional prescriptions.
It’s important to distinguish compounded semaglutide from unregulated powders sold as “generic Ozempic” and the like, which may be contaminated or counterfeit, said FDA spokesperson Amanda Hils. But since compounded forms of the drug are not FDA-approved, those who make, prescribe, or use them also should have “an increased level of responsibility or awareness,” she said.
Novo Nordisk and Lilly, in lawsuits each company has filed against competitors, say their own testing has found bacteria and other impurities in products made by compounding pharmacies. The companies also report patent infringement, but compounders, pointing to the FDA loophole for drugs in shortage, appear to have defeated that argument for now.
When the FDA removes the drugs from the shortage list, 503B compounders must immediately stop selling them. Smaller compounders may be able to produce their products for a reduced number of patients, said Scott Brunner, CEO of the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, which represents 503A compounders.
The evaporation of the compounded drug supply could come as a shock to patients.
“I dread it,” said David Wertheimer, MD, an internist in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, who prescribes compounded semaglutide to some patients. “People are not going to be able to plunk down a grand every month. A lot of people will go off the drug, and that’s a shame.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/pulsed-field-ablation-a-novel-nonthermal-option-for-paroxysmal-and-persistent-af/,Pulsed Field Ablation: A Novel Nonthermal Option for Paroxysmal and Persistent AF,"In December 2023, the PulseSelect pulsed field ablation (PFA) system received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF).1 PulseSelect (Medtronic) was the first PFA technology to receive FDA approval, and a second PFA system, Farapulse (Boston Scientific), was approved by the FDA in January 2024 for the treatment of drug-refractory, recurrent, symptomatic, paroxysmal AF.2
PFA is a novel energy source that uses electrical pulses to induce cardiac cell death via nonthermal electroporation.3 With greater selectivity for cardiomyocytes compared to thermal ablation, research findings suggest that PFA can achieve pulmonary vein isolation without the same risk for adverse events such as pulmonary stenosis or damage to the esophagus or phrenic nerve.4
In the prospective, single-arm, nonrandomized PULSED AF (Pulsed Field Ablation to Irreversibly Electroporate Tissue and Treat AF) trial, patients with recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF (n=150 in each cohort) were treated with the PulseSelect PFA system and monitored for 1 year using transtelephonic monitoring as well as periodic ECGs and Holter monitoring.3
According to the results, 66.2% of patients with paroxysmal AF and 55.1% of those with persistent AF met the primary efficacy endpoint, defined as “freedom from a composite of acute procedural failure, arrhythmia recurrence, or antiarrhythmic escalation through 12 months.”
One patient (0.7%) in each cohort experienced a serious adverse event (AE) related to the procedure or device (cerebrovascular accident and pericardial effusion), and there were no reported cases of damage to the pulmonary vein, esophagus, or phrenic nerve.
The authors noted that the efficacy rates observed in PULSED AF were similar to those observed in trials investigating established thermal ablation techniques, including the FIRE AND ICE, STOP Persistent AF, and STAR-AF II trials.
In the randomized, single-blind ADVENT trial, 305 patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF were treated with the Farapulse PFA system, and 302 patients were treated with conventional radiofrequency or cryoballoon ablation. Participants were monitored via similar methods as those used in the PULSED AF trial.
The results demonstrated the noninferiority of PFA compared with thermal ablation: 73.3% and 71.3% of patients in each group, respectively, met the primary efficacy endpoint (freedom from a composite of initial procedural failure, documented atrial tachyarrhythmia, antiarrhythmic drug use, cardioversion, or repeat ablation at 12 months).5
Serious AEs occurred in 2.1% of patients in the PFA group, including 1 death, 1 transient ischemic attack, 2 cases of cardiac tamponade or perforation, and 1 case each of pericarditis, pulmonary edema, and vascular-access complication. In the thermal ablation group, serious AEs were observed in 1.5% of patients and included 1 stroke, 1 instance of pulmonary edema, and 2 cases of vascular-access complication.
To learn more about the use of PFA systems in AF treatment, Cardiology Advisor interviewed Andrea Natale, MD, FACC, executive medical director of the Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St David’s Medical Center in Austin, Texas. Dr Natale was an investigator in both the PULSED AF and ADVENT trials, as well as trials investigating other PFA systems.
Dr Natale: For me, the safety is the most exciting thing about PFA. The efficacy is similar to the other technology, but the safety is really the important benefit of this approach. While every PFA system is different, they’re the same in terms of safety—and they’re certainly safer than the thermal energy source that we’ve been using for the last 20 to 30 years.
As a nonthermal energy source, PFA reduces the risk for a lot of the collateral damage that we always worry about with thermal energy. The high-volume centers have kind of figured out how to do a good job with the thermal energy, but most of the low-volume centers are still having complications, so from a safety point of view, the PFA technology is fantastic because it eliminates the risk of the most dangerous complications that are typical of thermal ablation.
Dr Natale: With the safety profile of this energy source, it opens the door to patients that, in the past, were referred to centers like ours. Obviously, when someone has AF and feels short of breath and has palpitations, these symptoms become an issue of quality life, but patients with no symptoms have often [not been considered for cardiac ablation] despite data suggesting that, even in patients with minimal symptoms, maintaining sinus rhythm can reduce morbidity and mortality.6
The standard indications for cardiac ablation in patients with AF still apply, but I think that because of the safety of PFA, it opens the door to subsets of patients that may not have previously been considered for ablation.
Dr Natale: Right now, all the devices are what we call “single shot,” so they’re designed for the pulmonary vein, but there are other targets that are important for certain subsets of patients with AF. There will be an evolution of devices with this new energy source that will allow more flexibility in where we need to go. Right now, we need to learn how much we can stretch the envelope and try to use the same device for areas [other than the pulmonary vein], but in the near future—probably in the next couple of years—I think we’re going to have an array of devices to address every single sort of potential clinical scenario.7
Dr Natale: There are more PFA devices on the horizon, including Varipulse from Johnson Johnson8-10 and Affera from Medtronic.11,12 [Editor’s note: Dr Natale was involved in the trials for both devices.] Both presented late-breaking trial data at the last Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) 2024 Annual Meeting in Boston, and both were published in May. We expect FDA approval of these devices sometime this year.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/valerie-fuller-phd-dnp-president-elect-aanp/,"Meet Valerie Fuller, PhD, DNP, and President-Elect of AANP","Valerie Fuller, PhD, DNP, is the President-elect of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners. Dr Fuller sat down with Nikki Kean, Director of The Clinical Advisor, to discuss her path to becoming a DNP, PhD, and her research interests, during the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP 2024) national conference, held in Nashville, Tennessee.
Dr. Fuller: Florence Nightingale once said:  “Let us never consider ourselves finished nurses. We must be learning all of our lives.”
When I decided to go back for Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP), I had been working as a Nurse Practitioner for several years and the translational research part of the DNP program spoke to me. I am a clinician at heart and patient care is my passion. Being able to translate research to the bedside and making sure that our patients are getting the best possible evidence-based outcomes is our goal.
Once I earned my DNP, I was asked to become more involved in performing research and decided to pursue a PhD. Once I finished, it clicked for me that I had the best of both worlds – the knowledge to generate new research and the ability to translate that information to the bedside to improve patients’ health.
Because of our training, nurse practitioners are the very best at working together with different teams of people, including different types of researchers, and bringing all that information together to make sure our patients are getting the very best care.
Dr Fuller: It was a tremendous honor. I was recognized by the Maine House of Representatives and the Senate. The medical provider program had been in place for many years for other providers. We made a proposal to include nurse practitioners and I was pleased to be the first advanced practice nurse to be asked to serve in that position.
Maine is a very rural state. We have many areas of Maine where people would not have access to health care if not for nurse practitioners, including many of our state legislators. We also have 3 APRNs (two of whom are NPs) serving in the Maine state legislature. It was just an honor for me to be there and to represent AANP and nurse practitioners across the state and the country.
Dr Fuller: As an NP, I recognized those barriers that prevented me from working to the full extent of my education, certification, and licensure and became passionate about trying to tear down those barriers and allow patients to have access to the provider of their choice.
I am lucky to work in Maine, which has had full practice authority (FPA) for 25 years. But 23 states do not have such access to NPs. In states with FPA, NPs are more likely to practice in rural and underserved areas and have improved workforce recruitment while maintaining the quality and safety standards. Non-FPA states that require regulated contracts are more closely associated with geographic health care disparities, higher chronic disease burden, primary care shortages, higher costs of care and lower standings on national health rankings.
It’s time to move past outdated laws and to expand access to high-quality care for patients and address the significant challenges in our health care system. AANP is focusing its efforts on making care more accessible to patients, providing added choice, and modernizing outdated laws that hinder effective and efficient health care delivery
Dr Fuller. I was working with vascular surgery patients and recognized that not everyone was on the same recovery path following surgery. Some patients were falling, having longer lengths of stay, and poorer outcomes. I became very concerned and started to investigate why that was the case.
My clinical doctorate examined the role of delirium, which is common condition seen in the postoperative period . About 15% to 53% of surgical patients will become delirious in the postoperative period.1-3 One of the biggest problems was that the clinicians weren’t recognizing it or intervening before it developed.
Because there are ways to screen and prevent postoperative delirium, I developed a program to educate the Department of Surgery on how to recognize and treat delirium. during my DNP program. The project rolled out in 2007 and was well received. The program expanded from the department to hospital wide, and then to the whole health care system, it was phenomenal.
The program has made an impact on the lives of many patients who were suffering. During that project, I talked to patients every day, then clinicians would have me evaluate their patients and ask me: ‘Valerie, what do you think about this case?’
The focus of my PhD research was a qualitative study looking at the patient’s experience with postoperative delirium. Patients began sharing stories about how frightening the experience was for them and I decided to investigate the patient experience of postoperative delirium and the measure the distress associated with the experience. The analysis of the quantitative measures and descriptive data demonstrated a high rate of psychological distress associated with delirium recall with 80% participants reporting it caused severe to very severe distress.
My interest in delirium and it outcomes also lead me to look at falls within the hospital, which were increasing in numbers. I worked on a replication study with several other clinicians and we found that more than 73% of patients were delirious at the time of their fall.
The prevention of falls from delirium is multifactorial, involving not prescribing medications known to cause delirium, like benzodiazepines or anticholinergic medications, providing frequent orientation to time and place, encouraging mobility, and eliminating tethers like foley catheters or IV lines.
That is one of the phenomenal parts about being an NP is we don’t look at a single problem. We look at how this affects the patient physically, mentally and spiritually and how it might affect the family, friends and even members of the health care team. We know from research that people who experience delirium have worse outcomes, and have cognitive deficits for months after surgery, with some patients having permanent deficits.4
Being able to make a significant and positive impact on patient’s lives has been the highlight of my career.",Nikki Kean
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/paris-olympics-promotes-sustainability/,Paris Olympics Promote Sustainability: Climate Change Is Putting Athletes and Sports At Risk,"The Conversation — is in the midst of a heat wave, and while Olympic athletes in Paris for the 2024 Summer Games might be spared the worst of it, the weather will still be hot.
As global temperatures have risen, major sporting events like the Olympics and FIFA World Cup have had to adapt to high heat and extreme storms to keep athletes and fans safe and allow the games to go on.
Olympic organizers have moved events such as marathons to early mornings and even to cooler cities. FIFA, the governing body for world soccer, pushed the 2022 Men’s World Cup back from its usual time in June to late November so it could be held in Qatar.
The heat risks and the environmental impact of major sporting events have led some people to question whether these events should be held at all. But as someone who studies sport management and sustainability in an area I coined “sport ecology,” I believe that radical approach misses the benefits, including the Olympics’ ability to promote sustainable actions to the public worldwide.
Sports have good reason for caring about sustainability: Climate change can put athletes’ and fans’ health at risk and even put the future of some sports in doubt.
Winter sports face the greatest threats from climate change as temperatures rise and precipitation changes, dramatically shortening winter sports seasons in many areas. In 2022, the Beijing Winter Games had to artificially create snow so it could have ski runs at all. The International Olympic Committee has delayed its decision to select Winter Games host cities for 2030 and beyond because of the uncertainty of winter sports.
In the summer, global warming fuels extreme heat and storms that can affect the quality of the competition and the health of the athletes and spectators.
Major sport federations and leagues, as well as the Olympics, have responded to the risks by delaying competitions to cooler times of day or year, implementing water breaks and offering more player substitutions.
Organizers of the Tokyo Summer Games, held amid a fierce heat wave in 2021, had preemptively moved the marathon to Sapporo, more than 500 miles north of Tokyo, so athletes could run in cooler weather. They also delayed competitions during the Games to avoid extreme heat and excessive rain.
Any large event like the Olympics can produce vast carbon emissions through its construction, transportation needs and energy use.
That impact, and the risks it creates for sports and their athletes, are why sustainability has been a pillar of the Olympic charter since 1996 and is a focus of its planning for the future. In 2012, the London Olympics pioneered a new international certification standard, ISO2012, which provides guidelines for any large event to make more sustainable choices, from construction to catering.
The 2024 Paris Games, from July 26 to August 11, and Paralympic Games, August 28 to September 8, are certified to the latest standard, and organizers are taking many steps to reduce their climate impact.
The organizers plan to power the events’ operations with 100% renewable energy from wind and solar. They are using existing venues when possible, had new ones built with low-carbon concrete and recycled materials, and brought in thousands of seats made of recycled plastic.
All furniture and temporary buildings approved for the Games also must have a contractually guaranteed second life, rather than going into a landfill. All of the competition venues are on public transportation, allowing for fewer vehicles in the streets. Even the food is targeted for a 50% emissions cut compared with the average meal by increasing the use of plant-based foods. The Paralympics will use the same venues and housing in the weeks that follow.
That doesn’t mean the 2024 Olympics won’t have a large carbon footprint, however, particularly as many spectators and athletes arrive by plane. But the organizers are aiming for the construction and operations emissions to be half those of the London and Rio Games in 2012 and 2016.
The Paris Olympic Games is an example of what large sporting events can do to reduce their impact on the environment and promote sustainability solutions to a global audience. Spectators will experience sustainability firsthand, and organizers will promote the Games’ sustainability efforts.
Such campaigns can influence people’s everyday behaviors and even increase their advocacy for sustainability in their home communities.
Suggestions to reduce the scale and size of sports events or even eliminate commercialized sports, ending spectator sports as we know them, overlook the ability of sports to influence and change human behavior.
Sustainability is a constantly evolving process of learning from the past to improve for the future.
The 2024 Olympics’ strategies, building on those used in previous events, and what Paris learns in carrying them out, will also help in planning for future events, including the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.
In essence, the Olympic Games, the largest sporting event in the world, is a sport sustainability world’s fair. It highlights what is possible for a sporting event through collaborations with international corporations to reduce its environmental impact. And it influences others to follow suit, whether that is other sporting events, leagues and federations or spectators from around the world.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/long-covid-puzzle-pieces-are-falling-into-place-the-picture-is-unsettling/,Long COVID Puzzle Pieces Are Falling Into Place – the Picture Is Unsettling,"The Conversation — Since 2020, the condition known as long COVID-19 has become a widespread disability affecting the health and quality of life of millions of people across the globe and costing economies billions of dollars in reduced productivity of employees and an overall drop in the work force.
The intense scientific effort that long COVID sparked has resulted in more than 24,000 scientific publications, making it the most researched health condition in any 4 years of recorded human history.
Long COVID is a term that describes the constellation of long-term health effects caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These range from persistent respiratory symptoms, such as shortness of breath, to debilitating fatigue or brain fog that limits people’s ability to work, and conditions such as heart failure and diabetes, which are known to last a lifetime.
I am a physician scientist, and I have been deeply immersed in studying long COVID since the early days of the pandemic. I have testified before the US Senate as an expert witness on long COVID, have published extensively on it and was named as one of Time’s 100 most influential people in health in 2024 for my research in this area.
Over the first half of 2024, a flurry of reports and scientific papers on long COVID added clarity to this complex condition. These include, in particular, insights into how COVID-19 can still wreak havoc in many organs years after the initial viral infection, as well as emerging evidence on viral persistence and immune dysfunction that last for months or years after initial infection.
A new study that my colleagues and I published in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 17, 2024, shows that the risk of long COVID declined over the course of the pandemic. In 2020, when the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2 was dominant and vaccines were not available, about 10.4% of adults who got COVID-19 developed long COVID. By early 2022, when the omicron family of variants predominated, that rate declined to 7.7% among unvaccinated adults and 3.5% of vaccinated adults. In other words, unvaccinated people were more than twice as likely to develop long COVID.
While researchers like me do not yet have concrete numbers for the current rate in mid-2024 due to the time it takes for long COVID cases to be reflected in the data, the flow of new patients into long COVID clinics has been on par with 2022.
We found that the decline was the result of 2 key drivers: availability of vaccines and changes in the characteristics of the virus – which made the virus less prone to cause severe acute infections and may have reduced its ability to persist in the human body long enough to cause chronic disease.
Despite the decline in risk of developing long COVID, even a 3.5% risk is substantial. New and repeat COVID-19 infections translate into millions of new long COVID cases that add to an already staggering number of people suffering from this condition.
Estimates for the first year of the pandemic suggests that at least 65 million people globally have had long COVID. Along with a group of other leading scientists, my team will soon publish updated estimates of the global burden of long COVID and its impact on the global economy through 2023.
In addition, a major new report by the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine details all the health effects that constitute long COVID. The report was commissioned by the Social Security Administration to understand the implications of long COVID on its disability benefits.
It concludes that long COVID is a complex chronic condition that can result in more than 200 health effects across multiple body systems. These include new onset or worsening:
Long COVID can affect people across the lifespan from children to older adults and across race and ethnicity and baseline health status. Importantly, more than 90% of people with long COVID had mild COVID-19 infections.
The National Academies report also concluded that long COVID can result in the inability to return to work or school; poor quality of life; diminished ability to perform activities of daily living; and decreased physical and cognitive function for months or years after the initial infection.
The report points out that many health effects of long COVID, such as post-exertional malaise and chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment and autonomic dysfunction, are not currently captured in the Social Security Administration’s Listing of Impairments, yet may significantly affect an individual’s ability to participate in work or school.
What’s more, health problems resulting from COVID-19 can last years after the initial infection.
A large study published in early 2024 showed that even people who had a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection still experienced new health problems related to COVID-19 in the third year after the initial infection.
Such findings parallel other research showing that the virus persists in various organ systems for months or years after COVID-19 infection. And research is showing that immune responses to the infection are still evident two to three years after a mild infection. Together, these studies may explain why a SARS-CoV-2 infection years ago could still cause new health problems long after the initial infection.
Important progress is also being made in understanding the pathways by which long COVID wreaks havoc on the body. Two preliminary studies from the US and the Netherlands show that when researchers transfer auto-antibodies – antibodies generated by a person’s immune system that are directed at their own tissues and organs – from people with long COVID into healthy mice, the animals start to experience long COVID-like symptoms such as muscle weakness and poor balance.
These studies suggest that an abnormal immune response thought to be responsible for the generation of these auto-antibodies may underlie long COVID and that removing these auto-antibodies may hold promise as potential treatments.
Despite overwhelming evidence of the wide-ranging risks of COVID-19, a great deal of messaging suggests that it is no longer a threat to the public. Although there is no empirical evidence to back this up, this misinformation has permeated the public narrative.
The data, however, tells a different story.
COVID-19 infections continue to outnumber flu cases and lead to more hospitalization and death than the flu. COVID-19 also leads to more serious long-term health problems. Trivializing COVID-19 as an inconsequential cold or equating it with the flu does not align with reality.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/stephen-ferrara-dnp-begins-second-year-president-of-aanp/,"Stephen Ferrara, DNP, Begins Second Year as President of AANP","Stephen Ferrara, DNP, and President of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) sat down with Nikki Kean, Director of The Clinical Advisor during the recent AANP 2024 conference in Nashville, TN, to discuss goals for this year, working with a divided Congress, and how to maintain work/life balance.
Stephen Ferrara: The Improving Care and Access to Nurses Act (ICAN Act)  was introduced in the House and the Senate in 2023. In May, I traveled to Washington, DC, where we held a congressional briefing luncheon with the American Academy of Nurse Midwives (AANW), the American Nurses Association (ANA), and the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA). It was an opportunity for us to talk to Capitol Hill staffers and inform them of the importance of the ICAN Act, which needs to be passed to modernize Medicare and Medicaid laws. [The legislation would remove administrative and practice barriers under Medicare and Medicaid for advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) and physician associates (PAs).]
We know there is bipartisan support for the bill, but we are in an election year and there is a lot of noise [related to the election] in Washington, DC. We are continuing to make sure that our lawmakers are aware of the necessity of passing this legislation this year. If it does not pass by December 31st, it will need to be reintroduced to the new Congress.
We continue to encourage AANP members to contact their representatives and discuss the importance of this legislation.
Stephen Ferrara: Currently 27 states and Washington, DC, have full practice authority and 5 states have active legislation that we are monitoring.  State legislative sessions are wrapping up now. We continue to monitor, support, and raise awareness of why full practice authority is important to modernize the licensure laws to allow nurse practitioners to care for and provide resources for their patients. We know it will increase access to care.
Stephen Ferrara: That is one of the states that we are watching. We need to get everybody on board to support it and have the governor sign the bill. Full practice authority in New York, where I’m from, only passed in 2022. We are hoping that some of that momentum from New York carries into New Jersey.
Some of the opposition to full practice authority is the mistaken idea that it will allow NPs to do more than they are licensed to do. However, in states that require a regulated contract between an NP and MD—states without FPA—NPs are unable to provide care or prescribe medications without maintaining a physician contract. Retiring that unnecessary bureaucratic requirement is an issue that appeals to a broad coalition of organizations. At the end of the day, it’s about increasing access to care.
Stephen Ferrara: The US News & World Report named the NP profession the #1 most attractive job in the US and the best health care job. We want to ensure that with the increased attention to the NP role, there is support for the faculty and students, including keeping the pipeline of nurse practitioners strong.
This starts with a strong NP faculty, which we know needs added financial investment. We know that NPs can make more money practicing clinically than working in academia. As you know, funding for physician education is highly subsidized through Medicare; NP education is not. Nurse practitioners complete both didactic classroom and clinical rotations at the same time. Ensuring that there is federal and state investment in NP faculty and clinical preceptors is one of the issues AANP continuously works on to help ensure steady and sustained funding is allocated.
We also want to ensure members have a good work/life balance. COVID-19 had a huge impact. Although improving work/life balance was not a new issue, it was exacerbated by the pandemic. We are working to ensure that there are mental health resources for practicing nurse practitioners trying to maintain a work/life balance.
Stephen Ferrara: It’s a lot of juggling but I try to stay grounded. I have my family and strong support at home, which I think is important. Finding time to unplug and discharge — I have to say that I probably could do a better job with that. It is inspiring for me to lead this organization and represent the 385,000 nurse practitioners across the US.
Stephen Ferrara: I plan to continue doing the work; our legislative priority items will continue to be the same. Federal workers’ compensation is another bill that we are looking to get support and passage — this legislation would update Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA) authorizing NPs to make diagnoses, certify disabilities, and oversee treatment for injured federal workers in accordance with state law, increasing access to care for federal employees, particularly in rural areas. Several states allow their state employees on workers’ compensation to see their nurse practitioners, but federal workers do not have the same option, so there’s a disparity. Imagine that you see a nurse practitioner for regular primary care, then you get injured at work and you want to continue to see the clinician who knows you the best. But you can’t because the federal workers’ compensation program has this barrier in place. So we want to fix that.",Nikki Kean
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/cdc-acip-meeting-updated-guidelines-and-recommendations-for-infectious-diseases/,"CDC ACIP Meeting: Updated Guidelines for RSV, COVID-19, HPV, and Other Vaccines","Between June 26 and 28, 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) discussed updates, guidelines, and recommendations for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), COVID-19, influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal, and other infectious diseases.
On May 31, 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Moderna’s mRESVIA® (mRNA-1345) vaccine for RSV. The single-dose prefilled syringe was approved for use in patients aged 60 years and older. This vaccine is an alternative to Abrysvo® (RSVPreF) and Arexvy® (adjuvanted RSVPreF3).1
At the June 2024 meeting, the ACIP voted to revise RSV vaccination guidelines. The RSV vaccine was previously recommended for all patients aged 75 and older, with eligibility extended to those aged 60 to 74 years in some cases. The new guidelines now recommend that high-risk patients in both age groups receive 1 lifetime dose of an RSV vaccine produced by any manufacturer. The CDC will publish clinical considerations that define which chronic medical conditions and other risk factors constitute high-risk populations. At this time, the ACIP recommends against the administration of a second dose for patients who have been vaccinated.2
This decision was influenced by data from the CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and the FDA’s report on Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) Rapid Cycle Analyses (RCA) on the risk for Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS) following RSV vaccination. The organizations observed an elevated incident rate ratio for GBS in RSV vaccine recipients. In a positive-predictive value-adjusted analysis, only RSVPreF vaccination was significantly associated with GSB risk. Although the risk of developing GBS secondary to RSV vaccination is low, the ACIP decided that the nature of the disease is too severe to justify administering RSV vaccines to populations who are not at immediate high risk until more data are gathered.3
The ACIP voted to recommend Vaxelis® (DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB), in addition to PedvaxHIB® (PRP-OMP), as another primary option for H influenzae type b (Hib) among American Indian and Alaska Native infants. Vaxelis, which is a combination vaccine, includes formulations to protect against diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP), inactivated poliovirus, H influenzae type b conjugate, and hepatitis B virus.4
This decision was based on data demonstrating that the proportion of American Indian or Alaska Native infants (N=298; Vaxelis, n=152; PedvaxHIB, n=146) with anti-Hib concentrations above the accepted value of short-term protection 30 days after dose 1 was similar between Vaxelis and PedvaxHIB recipients (75.7% and 71.2%, respectively). However, the proportion of infants with anti-Hib concentration above the accepted value of long-term protection 150 days after dose 1 was higher among Vaxelis recipients (83.6% vs 71.7%-71.8%; P <.05).4
During the 2023 to 2024 season, the VSD identified 2 statistical signals for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
The first was in relation to GBS occurrence following BNT162b2 vaccination among patients aged 65 years and older. It was determined that if vaccination confers increased risk for GBS, the risk is similar to what is considered acceptable for other vaccines recommended for adult populations.
The second was the incidence of ischemic stroke following mRNA-1273 vaccination in patients aged 65 years and older and BNT162b2 vaccination in patients aged 50 to 64 years. Although a statistical signal for ischemic stroke was observed with bivalent BNT162b2 in the 2022-2023 season, there is no clear or consistent evidence of safety issues for either mRNA vaccine with respect to ischemic stroke.5
The ACIP voted to recommend a single dose of the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine for, as authorized or approved by the FDA.6
The ACIP maintains their recommendation for routine annual influenza vaccination among all individuals aged 6 months and older with no known contraindications.7
Members of the committee also recommend high-dose inactivated (HD-IIV3) and adjuvanted inactivated (aIIV3) influenza vaccines as acceptable options for solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 to 64 years on immunosuppressive therapy, indicating no preference over other age-appropriate IIV3s or RIV3.7
A work group tasked with evaluating pneumococcal 21-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV21) use in adults considered the following policy questions:
The group members decided that there was not sufficient evidence to recommend lowering the age-based recommendation for PCV21 to 19 or 50 years.8
The ACIP voted to recommend PCV21 as an option among other vaccines available for adults aged 19 years and older for whom PCV receipt is indicated.8
The ACIP evaluated immunogenicity and safety data for the pentavalent meningococcal vaccine (MenABCWY) that were captured from phase 3 trials. In a broad panel of 110 serogroup B strains, representing 95% of US serogroup B disease-causing strains, the pentavalent vaccine demonstrated a persistent immune response for up to 24 months. Safety and immunogenicity were also demonstrated in adolescents and young adults.9
If approved by the FDA, the MenABCWY vaccine will be administered intramuscularly in 2 doses (0.5 mL per dose) given at least 6 months apart as active immunization to prevent invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y in individuals aged 10 to 25 years.9
Further data showed a favorable safety profile as well as noninferiority to the MenACWY and MenB vaccines. Although substantial drops in titers for serogroup A and 3 B strains were observed 24 months after pentavalent vaccination, a subsequent booster dose elicited a robust immune response.9
An ACIP Work Group presented risk-based guidelines to the ACIP, identifying potential risk groups for the MenB vaccine based on the duration of congregate living and time taken to complete the vaccine series. Evidence suggests that 4-year college students vs non-undergraduate students are at increased risk (5.2-fold higher) for serogroup B disease. Living on campus is another risk factor, increasing students’ risk for serogroup B disease by a factor of 2.9.10
The proposed risk groups include adolescents planning to attend college, as well as adolescents living in congregate settings (eg, foster care, boarding schools, and correctional facilities) for a long enough period to complete the MenB vaccine series. Any adolescent may receive the MenB vaccine if they desire protection, even if their congregate living-related risk is uncertain.10
Members of the National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases discussed the challenges of maternal RSV vaccine uptake in the 2023-2024 season as well as plans for the upcoming 2024-2025 RSV season.
In the 2023 season, an estimated 51.2% of infants were protected against RSV by either receipt of nirsevimab or maternal RSV vaccination. Clinicians faced limited supply of nirsevimab due to challenges with procurement and insurance coverage alongside timing of policy decisions. However, there are no anticipated supply challenges for the 2024-2025 season.11
Nirsevimab supply will be limited beginning in early September 2024 but broad availability is expected by October.
According to the ACIP, “All infants are recommended to be protected by either maternal RSV vaccination or nirsevimab for the 2024-25 RSV reason.”.11
In regard to the administration of Pfizer’s RSV vaccine during pregnancy, safety data reported by the CDC indicated that vaccine-related symptoms and conditions matched expectations for receipt between 32- and 36-weeks’ gestation. Further evidence also indicated that vaccination during pregnancy was associated with low preterm birth incidence (4.1%), falling within the expected historical range (3.1%-6.1%).12
The CDC also shared data on nirsevimab outcomes among infants during their first RSV (2023-2024) season. The vaccine was highly effective against RSV-associated emergency department encounters and hospitalization; however, the duration of protection remains unknown.13
During the meeting, the ACIP considered the administration of additional RSV doses among women beyond their first pregnancy. Members of the committee decided to recommend against maternal vaccination for patients who received the vaccine during a prior pregnancy. However, they recommend nirsevimab for infants born to women who were vaccinated against RSV during prior pregnancy. The ACIP may update their guidance in the future if presented with new data.14
With meetings beginning in July 2024, the ACIP will form a work group to review guidelines for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. Current guidance recommends that all patients receive 2 vaccines doses. Administration of the first dose is recommended between the ages of 11 and 12 but may occur as early as age 9. The second dose should be administered between 6 to 12 months of age. In patients aged 15 to 26 years, as well as immunocompromised individuals, the vaccine should be administered as a 3-dose series. Administration of the second dose should occur 1 to 2 months after the first dose, with the third dose at least 6 months thereafter. Shared clinical-decision making can be used to determine if the HPV vaccine should be administered to patients aged 27 to 45 years.15
The ACIP’s work group will consider the number of doses to recommend for the HPV vaccine series, age for routine vaccination, and guidance around shared clinical-decision making at the July 2024 meeting. General data related to the number of doses in the HPV vaccination schedule and routine age recommendations are expected to be presented to the ACIP in October 2024.15

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/scientists-discover-a-new-hormone-that-can-build-strong-bones/,Scientists Discover a New Hormone That Can Build Strong Bones,"A newly discovered hormone coined Maternal Brain Hormone keeps the bones of breastfeeding women strong during the postpartum period could also help bone fractures heal and treat osteoporosis in the broader population, according to a new study published in Nature.
Researchers at University of California (UC) San Francisco and UC Davis showed that in mice, the brain-derived cellular communication network factor 3 (CCN3) secreted from KISS1 neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARCKISS1) increases bone density and strength. Based on this discovery, the researchers now refer to CCN3 as the Maternal Brain Hormone (MBH).
Their results solve a long-standing puzzle about how women’s bones remain relatively robust during breastfeeding, even as calcium is stripped from bones to support milk production, according to a press release from the University of California.
“One of the remarkable things about these findings is that if we hadn’t been studying female mice, which unfortunately is the norm in biomedical research, then we could have completely missed out on this finding,” said Holly Ingraham, PhD, the senior author of the new paper and a professor cellular molecular pharmacology at UCSF. “It underscores just how important it is to look at both male and female animals across the lifespan to get a full understanding of biology.”
More than 200 million people worldwide suffer from osteoporosis. Women are at particularly high risk of osteoporosis after menopause because of declining levels of estrogen. Estrogen levels are also low during breastfeeding, yet osteoporosis and bone fractures are much rarer during this time, suggesting that something other than estrogen promotes bone growth.
Dr Ingraham’s lab previously discovered that in female mice, but not male mice, blocking a particular estrogen receptor found in select neurons in a small area of the brain led to huge increases in bone mass. They suspected that a hormone in the blood was responsible for the super-strong bones but, at the time, could not find it – a quest that was further protracted during the worldwide pandemic.
In the new work, Ingraham and collaborators carried out an exhaustive search for this bone-building hormone and finally pinpointed CCN3 as the factor responsible in mutant females. Initially, the team was surprised by this result, as CCN3 did not fit the typical profile of a secreted hormone from neurons. Then they found CCN3 in the same brain region in lactating female mice. Without the production of CCN3 in these select neurons, lactating female mice rapidly lost bone, and their babies began to lose weight, confirming the importance of the hormone in maintaining bone health during lactation.
When strategies to increase circulating CCN3 were implemented in young adult and older female or male mice, their bone mass and strength increased dramatically over the course of weeks. In some female mice who lacked all estrogen or were very old, CCN3 was able to more than double bone mass.
Thomas Ambrosi, PhD, an assistant professor of orthopaedic surgery at UC Davis and coauthor of the study, tested these bones, he was surprised by their strength.
“There are some situations where highly mineralized bones are not better; they can be weaker and actually break more easily,” he explained. “But when we tested these bones, they turned out to be much stronger than usual.”
Dr Ambrosi looked closely at the stem cells within the bones that are responsible for generating new bone and found that when these cells were exposed to CCN3, they were much more prone to generate new bone cells.
To test the ability of the hormone to assist in bone healing, the researchers created a hydrogel patch that could be applied directly to the site of a bone fracture, where it would slowly release CCN3 for 2 weeks. In elderly mice, bone fractures don’t usually heal well. However, the CCN3 patch spurred the formation of new bone at the site of the fracture, contributing to youthful healing of the fracture.
“We’ve never been able to achieve this kind of mineralization and healing outcome with any other strategy,” Dr Ambrosi said. “We’re really excited to follow it up and potentially apply CCN3 in the context of other problems, such as regrowing cartilage.”
The researchers plan to carry out future studies on the molecular mechanisms of CCN3, its levels in breastfeeding women, as well as the potential of the hormone to treat a variety of bone conditions.
Muriel Babey, MD, a co-first author and mentored physician-scientist in the Division of Endocrinology at UCSF, is keen to begin asking how CCN3 impacts bone metabolism in clinically relevant disease settings. Partnering with the UCSF Catalyst program, William Krause, Ph.D., a senior scientist and co-lead on this project will begin translating these new results.
“Bone loss happens not only in post-menopausal women but often occurs in breast cancer survivors that take certain hormone blockers; in younger, highly trained elite female athletes; and in older men whose relative survival rate is poorer than women after a hip fracture,” Ingraham said. “It would be incredibly exciting if CCN3 could increase bone mass in all these scenarios.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/gout-management-strategies-for-improving-quality-of-life/,Gout Management: Strategies for Improving Quality of Life,"Gout is an inflammatory rheumatic disease characterized by chronic arthritis resulting from the deposition of monosodium urate monohydrate crystals in the joint tissues.1 These crystals commonly accumulate in the first metatarsophalangeal joint, knees, and fingers.2
In addition to accumulating in the tissues, urate also saturates extracellular fluids. Hyperuricemia, a hallmark sign of gout, occurs when plasma or serum urate concentrations rise above 6.8 mg/dL: a threshold representing the limit of urate solubility.1
Risk factors for gout include genetics, certain comorbidities, and dietary factors. Around half of individuals with gout report a family history of the condition, suggesting a genetic inheritance. Researchers have identified 4 categories of altered genes associated with the development of gout:
Comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, and conditions that require taking medications that alter the urate balance may increase the risk of developing gout. Medications that alter the urate balance include cyclosporine, diuretics, ethambutol, low-dose aspirin, and pyrazinamide. Physical stress caused by illnesses, surgeries, trauma, dehydration, or starvation may trigger flare-ups of gout, along with certain dietary factors.1
Gout significantly impacts health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Historically, gout has been described as “the unwalkable disease,”3 inferring physical restrictions, limited functional mobility, and difficulties performing daily activities due to severe pain and joint inflammation.4 Intense pain and inflammation due to gout may necessitate immobilization during flares to prevent exacerbation. Physical limitations can also affect the mental and emotional health of individuals living with gout, increasing the likelihood of depressive symptoms and anxiety associated with functional disability.4
Immobilization and sedentary lifestyles precipitated by gout flares can potentially increase the risk of developing comorbidities that contribute to poorer HRQOL. Comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, depression, and anxiety, as well as longer disease duration, limited access to quality health care, higher number of tophi, and the use of colchicine and corticosteroids are correlated with worse HRQOL.4 The frequency and intensity of gout flares, pain experienced during the time between attacks (intercritical pain), and the number of affected joints are also associated with poorer HRQOL.5
In addition to pharmacological gout management, recommendations for specific lifestyle interventions are of the utmost importance for preventing disease flares, decreasing the risk for comorbidities associated with sedentary lifestyles, and improving HRQOL.
Advancements in nutritional science have led to a greater understanding of the mechanisms at play behind the dietary recommendations for gout management.2
Serum uric acid is a byproduct formed from purine catabolism. Disruption of purine metabolism results in significant variations in serum uric acid concentrations with purine overload resulting in hyperuricemia.2
Around two-thirds of purines are endogenous while the remaining one-third is obtained from dietary sources. While all meats and edible plants contain purines, some dietary sources contain higher concentrations — including seafood and animal organs — resulting in the increased production of serum uric acid. Yeast-rich foods and beverages may promote colonization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the intestines, which increases uric acid secretion.2
Alcohol consumption requires substantial amounts of adenosine triphosphate to be converted to adenosine monophosphate in the liver — a process that accelerates purine degradation and increases serum uric acid concentrations due to adenine nucleotide degradation and the production of lactate.2,6
While diet influences purine metabolism, it also can affect the ability of the intestines and kidneys to excrete uric acid. Diets high in fat and sugar impair transportation of urate via enterocytes. Ketogenic diets impair uric acid excretion; the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate is produced during implementation of the ketogenic diet and competes for binding sites on uric acid transporters.2 Sweet fruits, foods, and soft drinks high in fructose can elevate serum uric acid concentrations, either due to increased uric acid production or decreased excretion.6
In contrast, the Mediterranean diet or fiber-rich diets high in vegetables and fruits have reportedly helped to reduce systemic inflammation and gout flares.2 The Mediterranean diet is often recommended for individuals with gout due to its ability to reduce the risk for hyperuricemia.6
Dairy products may lower the risk for gout flares by reducing serum uric acid concentrations.1,6 Although the exact mechanism to explain this effect is unknown, casein, lactalbumin, and orotic acid in milk appear to contribute to lowering serum uric acid concentrations.6
Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds in cherries and cherry juice may reduce the frequency of gout flares.6 Coffee consumption has been found to decrease serum uric acid concentrations and hyperuricemia. The mechanisms explaining this effect are unclear; however, chlorogenic acid may contribute to this finding as it inhibits xanthine oxidase activity.6
Vitamin C supplementation has been found to decrease the occurrence of hyperuricemia, potentially by increasing the glomerular filtration rate and the subsequent excretion of uric acid in the urine.6 However, the 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines recommend against vitamin C supplementation to manage gout, due to insufficient data.7
Some researchers have cautioned against the conventional use of low-purine diets among individuals with gout. People adhering to these diets may compensate by consuming higher amounts of carbohydrates and fats, potentially worsening cardiometabolic comorbidities. It is instead recommended that gout be considered as a manifestation of metabolic syndrome, given its association with insulin resistance.8
Consequently, dietary recommendations should be customized according to comorbidity profiles and cardiometabolic risk factors. In addition to the Mediterranean diet, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet can be recommended for individuals with obesity or overweight, as both diets can benefit those at risk for developing cardiometabolic diseases.8
A review of the literature published by Danve et al in 2022 reported that the current research provides limited evidence supporting the use or avoidance of certain foods for the management of gout. These dietary factors have demonstrated only a small effect on serum urate levels and the frequency of gout flares. Urate lowering therapies remain the foundation for gout treatment.9
The authors of the 2020 ACR guidelines noted, “Dietary modifications likely yield only small changes in [serum urate] concentration, but dietary factors may serve as triggers for flares, and patients frequently seek advice on dietary management.”7 Patients may feel stigmatized when discussing their diet with clinicians. Providers should be mindful, as dietary recommendations can be misinterpreted and cause patients to feel blamed for their condition.
The 2021 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) taskforce continued to recommend avoidance of sugary beverages and heavy intake of meat and seafood while encouraging intake of low-fat dairy products. However, they emphasized that the consumption of specific foods was unlikely to yield large beneficial effects on gout-related outcomes. The taskforce also advised that providers be aware of the risk for gout flares associated with alcohol consumption.10
Results of a murine study by Jablonski et al indicated that regular, moderate physical exercise may attenuate the pathological processes involved in gout flares. Moderate activity affected the inflammatory immune response by downregulating TLR2 expression on neutrophils circulating in the peripheral blood. Low to moderate intensity exercise was also found to suppress systemic CXCL1 expression.11
These study findings support the exercise-mediated suppression of NF-κB activity and IL-1β expression. Routine physical activity also contributed to a reduction in flares, inflammatory biomarkers, and pain levels among patients with gout.11
Interestingly, results from the same study also indicated that high physical activity levels resulted in levels of inflammation that more closely mirrored lack of physical activity. Overexercising or high-intensity workouts do not provide anti-inflammatory benefits that differ significantly from sedentary lifestyles, when compared with low to moderate intensity exercise routines.11
The 2021 EULAR guidelines for individuals with rheumatic diseases encouraged regular, moderate physical activity, incorporating both aerobic exercise and strength training. Current evidence supports the benefits of exercise, especially in the short-term, for reducing pain and improving function and HRQOL among individuals with rheumatic diseases, including gout.10
Weight loss programs are encouraged for individuals with gout with comorbid obesity or overweight.7,12 Bariatric surgery for weight loss may result in short-term elevation of serum uric acid concentrations and gout flares.12
As with many inflammatory, rheumatic conditions, gout is associated with sleep disturbances.13 In particular, research has indicated that hyperuricemia is associated with shorter sleep duration.14
Gout flares affect both the quality and quantity of sleep. Severe pain due to gout flares interrupts sleep, makes it difficult to find comfortable positions, requires getting up to take pain relievers, and prevents adequate rapid eye movement-phase sleep. Side effects of gout medications, particularly gastrointestinal problems resulting from colchicine, may also disturb sleep.Comorbidities including depression, anxiety, sleep apnea, and hypertension can also exacerbate sleep disturbances among patients with gout.15
Sleep apnea reduces oxygen concentrations in the blood, resulting in increased purine production. Slower breathing during sleep may result in respiratory acidosis, resulting in higher blood carbon dioxide concentrations and increasing acidity levels. An acidic environment may promote the formation of uric acid crystals. Both of these respiratory alterations can increase the risk for gout flares at night.16 Dehydration along with drops in both cortisol and body temperature may also contribute to increased gout flares at night.16
Strategies to improve sleep quality and quantity among individuals with gout must focus on effective pain control, management of comorbid conditions, and minimization of medication-related side effects during sleep. Adequate hydration throughout the day and evaluations for sleep apnea are important strategies to prevent nighttime gout flares and sleep disturbances.16
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, systemic glucocorticoids, or anakinra are recommended treatments for acute gout flares; these medications can also be used as prophylactic agents in the setting of urate-lowering therapy. The ACR strongly encourages at least 3 to 6 months of prophylaxis during the initiation of urate lowering therapy, as the rapid changes in serum urate concentrations may trigger acute gout flares.17
The use of NSAIDs should be avoided among patients with chronic kidney disease, while colchicines should be avoided by those with end stage renal disease. Caution should be used when prescribing systemic glucocorticoids to individuals with diabetes or hypertension.17
The nonpharmacological management of acute gout flares includes the application of topical ice packs, rest, and avoidance of known triggers.18 In between acute flares, routine low to moderate intensity exercise may help reduce and manage intercritical pain levels.10,11
Psychosocial factors can impact HRQOL among patients with gout, according to results of a cross-sectional study by Wang et al. Positive psychology and attitudes — including resilience, hopefulness, and motivation to self-manage gout-related outcomes — were correlated with active treatment and adherence to dietary recommendations. According to the information-motivation-behavioral skills model, sufficient patient education, motivation, and behavioral skills are required to sustain positive behavioral changes to successfully improve HRQOL.Clinicians caring for patients with gout should provide constant psychological support to boost resilience, hope, and motivation in order to improve HRQOL among these individuals.18
In a cross-sectional study, Peláez-Ballestas et al evaluated various coping strategies, categorizing them into direct, reappraisal, evasive, and emotional/negative coping strategies. Direct coping and reappraisal strategies were associated with decreased pain and fatigue, improved physical and mental status, and better HRQOL.19
Compared against patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, patients with gout depended more on coping strategies, particularly reappraisal, evasive, and emotional/negative strategies. Findings from this study suggested that patients living with chronic disease and facing daily-life stressors often coped using negative strategies (evasion) compared with positive strategies (reappraisal).19 Therefore, incorporating mental health interventions into gout management has the potential to improve HRQOL outcomes.
Implementation of a treatment program that emphasizes regular low to moderate intensity exercise, a healthy, well-balanced diet, and quality sleep may also help to moderate mood changes associated with gout.20
Certain patient education strategies may increase adherence to treatment plans, encourage accountability for the self-management of gout, and improve HRQOL outcomes. These include nurse-led educational and care programs,21 as well as the use of mobile apps and technology that track behaviors and habits in order to encourage adherence to lifestyle modifications.22
Regularly scheduled follow-ups and constant communication between patients and providers are important for evaluating adherence to treatment plans, assessing treatment efficacy, and determining whether changes in medications or treatment plans are needed.
Factors that may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in the treatment of gout include: social determinants of health, lower health literacy, lower socioeconomic status, difficulties accessing quality healthcare, nonadherence to medications and treatment plans, lack of patient-provider communication, and increased aversion to treatment.23
Black patients are less likely to receive quality care for gout, resulting in increased morbidity23 and significantly worse HRQOL outcomes, compared with White patients.24 An editorial written by McCormick and Choi noted that Black, Native Hawaiian, and Japanese patients faced a higher risk for incident gout compared with White patients, while Latino patients had a lower risk.25
Women with gout are less likely than men to be receive allopurinol or undergo joint aspiration in order to assess for crystal deposition and establish an official diagnosis. However, women are equally or more likely than men to receive serum urate assessments within 6-months after beginning urate lowering therapy.23
These findings suggest a need for increased efforts to monitor, educate, and counsel patients from these respective groups.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/paccarb-antimicrobial-resistance-recommendations-to-reduce-global-burden/,PACCARB Recommendations for Global Action Against Antimicrobial Resistance,"Members of the 25th Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (PACCARB) held a public meeting from May 21 to 22, 2024 to vote on recommendations to reduce the global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
The PACCARB members also highlighted several barriers to address in reducing the burden of AMR, including workforce shortages in the infectious disease (ID) space, the disproportionate impact of AMR on marginalized populations, and the need for innovative solutions to avoid inappropriate antibiotic use.
The PACCARB was created by executive order in 2014 for members to discuss methods to prevent antibiotic resistance under the consideration of the global One Health approach.1 This approach highlights how the environment, plants, and animals contribute to an individual’s health.4 Some of the leading issues the PACCARB and other governmental organizations emphasized in the One Health framework were AMR, vector-borne diseases, foodborne illnesses, human-animal bonds, and contaminated water. As humans grow closer to animals and with ongoing climate change, there are more opportunities for zoonotic disease spread.
On December 20th, 2023, the PACCARB held their first public meeting to gather information for the AMR recommendation report with the contribution of 5 federal agencies: the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office of Global Affairs, US Department of State, US Agency for International Developments, US Department of Agriculture, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
In February 2024, the PACCARB members discussed international efforts to combat AMR, highlighting the importance of education, infection prevention, and data sharing. Following the meeting, the Global AMR Working Group drafted a report of recommendations for the PACCARB members to consider for maximizing global action against AMR.
On May 21, 2024,1 the PACCARB unanimously voted on recommendations for advancing US leadership in global efforts against AMR. The recommendations were shared with the Secretary of the DHHS, and the full report is available on the PACCARB website.3 The key recommendations are as follows:2,6
Efforts to combat the global threat of AMR have been complicated by shortages in the ID workforce.
Amanda Jezek, senior vice president of Public Policy and Government Relations for the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), remarked on the importance of the ID workforce in combating AMR, as well as the Bio-Preparedness Workforce Program, which incentivizes health care professionals to pursue careers in ID, particularly in underserved communities.1
“This is really critical in incentivizing healthcare professionals to first, choose ID, and second work in the areas where they are most needed. It would incentivize that by offering up to 3 years of loan repayment for service as an ID professional,” Jezek noted. “And again,” she continued, “that could be ID physician, ID pharmacist, clinical lab person, infection preventionist, and so on. And to work in an area that’s been designated by HRSA [Health Resources and Services Administration] as a health professional shortage area, medically underserved community, or certain federal facilities like VA hospitals and clinics, Ryan White clinics, community health centers, and so on.”1
Nearly 80% of US counties do not have a single ID physician,5 and current workforce shortages preclude future shortages in the ID space. Approximately half (51%) of ID training programs were at capacity in 2023 compared with 75% in 2020, whereas matriculation to other specialty training programs has remained robust.5
The shortage in ID physicians can be attributed to financial barriers, with medical students accumulating a mean of $250,000 by graduation.5 Many students opt out careers in ID — the third lowest paying specialty (annual salary, $261,000) — and instead choose more lucrative specialties like orthopedics ($558,000) and plastic surgery ($536,000).5
According to Jezek, “[I]nfectious disease is now below internal medicine and family medicine. So, what we’re essentially telling people is you could go right out of your residency and be an internist or family medicine doctor and make more money, or you could go and do another 2 to 3 years [of schooling] to become an ID physician and earn less. That’s really, really hard to convince people to do, especially when they have that heavy medical student debt already hanging over them.”
In light of the growing threat of AMR, the CDC estimates that the annual incidence of AMR infections will reach 3 million in the US, potentially resulting in 50,000 deaths.1
Therefore, the CDC has invested approximately $10 million to combat AMR.1 The funding will be allocated to infrastructure designed to improve AMR detection and response nationwide, as well as laboratories in 20 partner countries that will aid in research efforts to reduce the global AMR burden.1
During the PACCARB meeting, Roshanak Mehdipanah, PhD, of the University of Michigan, noted that 42 million US homes suffered from energy poverty in 2021. In addition, more than 2 million US individuals live without basic access to safe drinking water and sanitation and nearly 12 million face exposure to unhealthy levels of air pollution, particularly people of color.1
The threat posed by AMR is higher for areas in the US where redlining practices have been implemented. Long-term disinvestment in these areas has been linked to an increased risk for AMR through several factors, including overcrowding in households, poor hygiene and sanitation, contaminated water, and health-care associated infections.1
Innovations in diagnostics and cloud-based technology may help reduce the global AMR burden and improve antibiotic stewardship.
FebriDx, a rapid point-of-care test for acute respiratory infections, has been approved by the FDA for use in urgent care centers and emergency departments.7
Annie Bell MSN, APN, senior director of Medical Affairs at Lumos Diagnostics, explained that “the test works by using 2 host response biomarkers. The first one is C-reactive protein and the other is a mix of virus resistance protein A or MXA.” According to Bell, “It’s a very simple test to use. It can be used right at the patient visit, by clinicians, to make decisions about whether or not a patient has a bacterial infection and would benefit from an antibiotic, or more likely, does not have a bacterial infection and may not benefit.”
FebriDx boasts an accuracy of 99% in ruling out the presence of a bacterial infection.
Elemeno Health is a multimedia just-in-time microlearning application customized for frontline health care workers. The app helps to streamline training for health care professionals on different medical topics, including antibiotic stewardship. The app is designed to compile important health care data in an accessible and digestible format.8
According to Dr Arup Roy-Burman, founder and chief medical officer at Elemeno, the app has been beneficial for several hospitals. At the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) hospital, Children’s Hospital in New Orleans, and USCF Benioff Children’s Hospitals, use of the app has led to reductions in central line-associated bloodstream infections, Clostridioides difficile infections, and severe patient harm, respectively.1
“Our ability to protect the world from infectious diseases is endangered by the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which spreads regardless of geographic boundaries, politics, or conflict,” PACCARB members noted. “Global collaboration, leadership, and action are required to combat AMR, which is a fundamental threat to global health security, and the United States is positioned to be a leader of this effort worldwide,” they concluded.2

Thakkar is the APP supervisor of internal medicine and APP fellowship coordinator at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. He has been a PA for 12 years and started his career in hospital/critical care medicine in a rural community hospital then transitioned to advanced heart failure and heart transplant medicine at Northwestern Memorial in Chicago for 4 years.
PA Thakkar: Growing up, the biggest driver that led me to medicine was seeing my mom suffer from metastatic breast cancer. This happened in India in the late 1980s, needless to say, the infrastructure wasn’t as robust as it is now, delaying her diagnosis by 3 years, By the time she was truly diagnosed the cancer had already metastasized. Seeing that disparity and the implications, truly have stuck with me.
Her clinical team’s empathy and kindness were extraordinary, which makes you thankful to see those small deeds being done by others and how they impacted her life. That was one of the biggest driving factors that pushed me towards a career in medicine.
PA Thakkar: I’m someone who learns from everyone, as long as we keep an open mind and attitude, everyone has something to teach us.
PA Thakkar: The biggest challenge I think we face is the access to quality health care, this leads to the health care disparities we see today. It is important to know your patients’ stories and what challenges they face at home due to societal factors that may exacerbate the quality of health care outcomes. As health care providers, it is our obligation to focus on prioritizing our patients and knowing their stories to determine the best way to help them.
The more quality educators with diverse backgrounds we have, the more we can diversify the workforce and train more clinicians to close the gap in health care disparities.
PA Thakkar: I’ve had the privilege of working at Moffitt Cancer Center and working with one of the most challenging patient populations; at the same token, this is also the most rewarding and gratifying patient population I’ve ever worked with. The hope and courage that these patients demonstrate in their difficult journey helps me to have hope and courage as well. Despite overwhelming odds, they are motivated to get better.
PA Thakkar: From the education perspective, we’ve advanced practice provider (APP) fellowships that take the education of new graduates to the next level and prepare them for patient care. We also worked on establishing an APP student teaching service line. This helps students from a variety of schools and programs. The main point is to increase the number of students and help with rotations.
By breaking down their rotations we were able to optimize the number of preceptors and increase preceptor participation as well. It works both ways and helps to open up more spots for students in order for us to have more diverse clinicians by increasing preceptor participation. We also have more diverse educators who can truly relate to these students who are coming through. The ultimate goal is to help enforce diversity, equity, and inclusion, which is a small effort to reduce health care disparities.",Jeanelle Jacobs
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/transfusion-transmitted-malaria-addressed-by-blood-products-advisory-committee/,Transfusion-Transmitted Malaria: Mitigation Strategies and FDA Recommendations,"The 125th Meeting of the Blood Products Advisory Committee was held on May 9, 2024 to discuss strategies to reduce the risk for transfusion-transmitted malaria. The committee examined updates on blood product research, regulatory changes, and safety protocols.1
Malaria, historically an epidemic in the southern US, has not been a significant public threat since the early 1950s. In 1970, the World Health Organization (WHO) certified the US as malaria-free. However, there is still a risk for sporadic local mosquito-transmitted malaria in the US. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidelines for malaria surveillance and has been working with state and local health departments to investigate each case and maintain malaria-free status in the US.
The number of malaria diagnoses in the US significantly decreased from 2019 to 2020 due to disruptions in international travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a 70% reduction in malaria diagnoses during this time (from 2050 to 600), the rate of malaria-attributed mortality remained the same.1
Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are crucial for reducing morbidity and preventing complications associated with malaria. The 2 main diagnostic methods used for malaria include microscopic examination and rapid diagnostic testing. Treatment for the disease involves the use of antimalarial medications, with specific agents selected based on the causative parasite, symptom severity, and the infected patient’s overall health.1
According to Seymour Williams, MD, MPH, “US residents are at a high risk of progressing to severe malaria even if the initial symptoms are mild so hospitalizations should always be considered when malaria is diagnosed.”2
Transfusion-transmitted malaria is acquired via asymptomatic blood donors with chronic infections who have traveled or resided in malaria-endemic areas. To minimize the risk for transmission, blood donations are not permitted for 3 months after travel to areas where malaria is common.2
Symptoms of transfusion-transmitted malaria are similar to those of mosquito-borne malaria. These include fever, chills, and fatigue, which may progressively worsen and lead to severe complications such as malarial anemia. For transfusion-transmitted malaria, symptom severity varies based on the type of Plasmodium parasite. The disease has an incubation period of 1 to 12 weeks after a transfusion and a fatality rate of approximately 11%. The diagnosis of transfusion-transmitted malaria is commonly delayed in the US, occurring between 1 and 180 days following the transfusion.2
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has implemented several measures to reduce the risk for transfusion-transmitted malaria, including guidance on deferral and reentry after travel to malaria-endemic areas and blood product management. In March 2024, the FDA licensed the first test to screen blood donors for Plasmodium infection. However, no FDA-approved pathogen reduction-technology exists for whole blood or red blood cells.2
Although deferring individuals with a history of malaria or travel to endemic regions is an effective way to ensure blood supply safety, the recommended 3-month deferral period may not be sufficient for identifying all asymptomatic malaria infections, particularly in those with partial immunity or a history of malaria. Moreover, this strategy may prevent blood donations from healthy donors.2
High-sensitivity Plasmodium nucleic acid testing (NAT) is a more effective method of malaria prevention. The sensitivity of NAT is more than 1000 times greater than that of microscopy and antigen-based assays for routine malaria diagnosis. Moreover, NAT has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detecting 5 Plasmodium species, including P falciparum, P vivax, P malaria, P ovale, and P knowlesi.2
The Code of Federal Regulations outlines the FDA’s approach to blood safety as well as necessary actions to reduce risk for malaria and other relevant transfusion-transmitted infections. Blood establishments are required to test for these infections if certain conditions are met: a licensed, FDA-approved donor screening test must be available for use and considered necessary to adequately reduce disease transmission.3
Recommendations for transfusion-transmitted malaria prevention also include the use of an FDA-recognized donor history questionnaire. To assess malaria risk, blood donors are asked 2 questions:3
An individual’s eligibility to donate blood is determined based on their response to these questions and a thorough assessment of their potential risk of transmitting malaria or other relevant transfusion-transmitted infections.
The FDA has proposed 3 selective testing strategies in an effort to address limitations identified in current recommendations for transfusion-transmitted malaria prevention:3
Members of the committee considered the strategies proposed by the FDA at their May meeting. Some members favored Strategy 1A over 1B, citing concerns with the high cost and potentially low effectiveness associated with Strategy 1B.1
“It appears to me that the difference is the greater cost for strategy 1B, but both strategies have the additional benefit of adding more diverse critical needed donors to the donor pool; however, I think it would be too extreme a cost for 1B to be worth it,” a committee member noted.1
Concerns were also raised at the meeting regarding the sensitivity of NAT for malaria detection. A committee member noted that malaria RNA levels, which determine the presence of asymptomatic infection, can vary greatly depending on sample sources and testing methods. Another member commented that NAT has proven sensitive in detecting transfusion-transmitted malaria disease.1
“Although admittedly it is indirect,” the committee noted, “we believe there is more evidence to support that the test will work to detect asymptomatic infection…”
Opinions among the committee differed regarding the strategy of testing all blood donations in US regions where local mosquito-borne malaria has been reported. Some supported it, highlighting the increased risk for malaria transmission due to climate change as well as the vulnerability of partially immunocompromised elderly populations in southern states, like Florida. Others were less optimistic, pointing out challenges in identifying a single case of malaria and questioning whether the strategy would significantly impact blood safety.1
The meeting emphasized the need for more effective and targeted testing methods beyond donor questionnaires. Overall, insights shared by the committee members suggest continued innovation in malaria screening protocols is needed to maintain blood supply safety and address emerging threats to public health.
According to Sanjai Kumar, PhD, FASMH; Chief of the FDA’s Laboratory of Emerging Pathogens, “The current FDA’s recommendations are insufficient to identify and defer all blood donors with asymptomatic Plasmodium infections.2”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/treatment-of-autism-updated-aba-guidelines/,Updated ABA Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder,"The Council of Autism Service Providers (CASP) has published updated applied behavior analysis (ABA) practice guidelines for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These guidelines provide health care providers and government health agencies with the latest evidence and best practices regarding the use of ABA for individuals with ASD.
At intake, the standard of ABA care involves the use of multi-method, multi-informant data sources to provide providers with a well-rounded view of patient functioning. As part of the assessment process, behavior should be directly observed and recorded by behavior analysts.
At initial assessment, behavior analysts should conduct a record review to understand patient needs and develop a treatment plan. In the record review, providers should gather information about the patient’s medical history, treatment response to prior interventions, current treatment plan, and cultural and familial considerations that may affect treatment.
Following the record review, providers should interview both patients and caregivers to further understand patient needs and the desired outcomes of treatment. As a hallmark of ABA, providers should measure behavior through direct observation and define target behaviors in measurable terms through continuous and/or discontinuous procedures. These observational measurements should be frequently repeated to assess treatment progress.
Behavioral observation types include functional behavior assessments, skills-based assessments, and standardized assessments. However, the guideline authors caution that providers should not rely on only 1 method of assessment to determine the ABA treatment course. Instead, the use of multiple measures that include both direct observation and caregiver reports is encouraged.
Additionally, providers should utilize risk assessments and assessments from other medical professionals when developing a treatment plan.
Treatment planning for people with ASD should be individualized to each patient and involve collaboration with caregivers and medical professionals to achieve optimal outcomes.
To provide patients with quality ABA services, the individualized treatment plan needs to take into consideration evidence-based best practices, the patient’s age and baseline functioning, target behaviors, caregiver circumstances and skills, and the resources needed to successfully implement the treatment plan. The scope of each treatment plan generally falls into one of 2 major categories: focused and comprehensive.
Focused ABA is narrower in scope and generally targets only 1 or 2 treatment domains. Focused ABA treatment is appropriate for patients who may need to acquire a more limited number of skills or who demonstrate high-risk behaviors that need immediate attention due to health/safety concerns.
In contrast, comprehensive ABA is much wider in scope and is intended to improve or maintain behaviors across multiple skill domains. Comprehensive ABA treatment is frequently used as an early intervention among young children with ASD, as it is intended to address developmental delays and establish foundational skills.
Providers should determine the appropriate treatment intensity based on each patient’s baseline skills and necessary treatment scope. However, the guideline authors indicate that typically “the practitioner should err on the side of caution by providing a higher level of service intensity.” To increase accessibility, ABA services can be administered in person, via telehealth, or through hybrid models.
According to the CASP guideline, tiered service-delivery models are well-documented in peer-reviewed literature as the primary methodology for yielding substantial improvements in cognitive, language, social, behavioral, and adaptive skills. These models employ the use of treatment teams that work under the direction of behavior analysts and can be two-tiered or three-tiered. The use of tiered models is beneficial for providers, caregivers, and funders as it is cost-effective and increases access to ABA services.
In order for the tiered service-delivery model to be effective, the following should be implemented:
Measuring treatment outcomes can be complex, as treatment plans often establish both short- and long-term goals whose outcomes may fluctuate over the course of treatment. Outcome measures should reflect each patient’s specific treatment goals and can include both objective, standardized assessments and qualitative feedback from patients and/or caregivers.
The guideline authors caution that there is currently no consensus that defines treatment progress or the prescribed batteries of tests for patients undergoing ABA treatment of autism. Further, demographic and cultural factors should be considered when interpreting outcomes.
Providers should begin to consider discharge planning at the start of treatment, clearly defining the desired outcomes of treatment and sufficient progress that warrants discharge. The patient can be discharged under the following conditions:
The transition plan should also account for multiple stages of transition, as patients gradually reduce support and ultimately achieve a more independent level of care.
In some cases, families may need to end or temporarily suspend services due to funding issues, family circumstances, unreconcilable differences in treatment ideation, or during the transition to a new provider. In these situations, providers should outline why the decision was made and the clinical recommendation for ongoing services. Further, the provider should facilitate the continuation of care (upon consent from the family and/or patient).“These practice guidelines provide information about standards of care in ABA that should be used in planning, implementing, and evaluating assessment and treatment services,” the guideline authors stated. While the guidelines were written based on scientific evidence and expert clinical opinion, the authors emphasize that the application of the recommendations must be individualized to each patient with ASD.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/derm-clinic-annular-erythematous-firm-plaques/,Derm Clinic: Annular Erythematous Firm Plaques,"A 72-year-old man with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes presents with a 6-month history of several skin lesions on the bilateral upper extremities, upper back, and chest. He denies cough, shortness of breath, fevers, night sweats, and peripheral numbness. He has not started any new medications in the past year. The lesions are erythematous annular firm plaques, have no overlying scale, and are nonpruritic and non-tender. A punch biopsy of a lesion reveals palisading giant cells and histiocytes surrounding necrobiotic collagen and mucin.
Granuloma annulare (GA) is an idiopathic granulomatous inflammatory disorder of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Many clinical presentations exist, but GA commonly consists of well-demarcated annular pink to brown plaques on the dorsal hands or feet. The condition was first described as “ringed eruption of the fingers” in 1895 by Calcott Fox, with the term “granuloma annulare” coined in 1902 by Radcliffe Crocker.1
In the United States, the annual incidence of GA is estimated to be 0.04%, with a prevalence of 0.06%.2 Age of onset varies by subtype, however most patients present under 50 years of age.3 Childhood is a common time of onset, especially in the subcutaneous form of GA.2,3 Granuloma annulare demonstrates a female predilection, with a 2:1 female-to-male ratio.1,3 Few data exist on genetic predisposition for GA, but it has been hypothesized that the generalized subtype of GA could be associated with human leukocyte antigen-Bw35 (HLA-Bw35).3
The etiology of GA is not well understood but is hypothesized to be precipitated by a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to an unknown inciting stimulus. Trauma, infection, arthropod reactions, vaccination, or certain drugs (such as TNF-αinhibitors) may precede the development of GA.1 Th1-mediated inflammatory cascades drive the release of cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF, which promote the accumulation of monocytes in the dermis and subsequent degradation of underlying connective tissue.1 Recent studies also suggest an involvement of Th2-mediated inflammation and the JAK/STAT pathway.1,4
Studies have found that individuals with GA were more likely to have comorbid conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism.1,3,5 Importantly, it was previously believed GA increased the risk for hematologic malignancies, but recent studies have found no compelling association.5
Granuloma annulare can have atypical phenotypes but is usually characterized into four distinct variants; localized, subcutaneous, generalized, and perforating.1,3 Localized GA is the most common subtype, representing about three-fourths of GA cases.3 Localized GA typically presents as asymptomatic, annular, pink to red to brown, non-scaly papules or plaques.1 The extremities, especially the dorsal hands and feet, are most often the involved sites. Localized GA can self-resolve over months to years.3
Subcutaneous GA presents as nontender, firm subcutaneous nodules most often on the lower extremities. These lesions are referred to as “pseudorheumatoid nodules” because of their clinical similarity with rheumatoid nodules.1,3 Importantly, subcutaneous GA is almost exclusively seen in children.3 Like localized GA, subcutaneous GA can resolve spontaneously.3
Generalized GA is a disseminated form of GA characterized by annular plaques or coalescing papules involving the trunk, neck, scalp, and extremities.1 This subtype follows a bimodal age distribution, commonly affecting individuals less than 10 years or older than 40 years.6 Generalized GA is notoriously refractory to treatment and may persist for years.1,6
Perforating GA is an uncommon subtype characterized by umbilicated papules with central hyperkeratotic or ulcerated core. Distribution may be restricted to the extremities alone, or generalized involving the extremities and trunk.3
Histologically, GA is characterized by mucin deposition, localized degeneration of collagen and elastic fibers, and one of two patterns of granulomatous inflammation. The most common granulomatous inflammation pattern among GA cases is interstitial, where histiocytes are interspersed between collagen fibers and blood vessels in the dermis.3 The second pattern of granulomatous inflammation is palisading, where histiocytes and giant cells surround a central necrotic core of mucin and degraded connective tissue.1,3 Histologically, subcutaneous GA commonly demonstrates deep nodules with this palisading pattern surrounded by a peripheral zone of lymphocytes and eosinophils.3 Perforating GA also involves the palisading pattern of granulomatous inflammation, but transepithelial collagen elimination is additionally seen.1,3 More than 90% of GA lesions will demonstrate increased mucin. 1 GA and other granulomatous disorders show strong positivity for the oncogenic protein gli-1 and show increased expression of CD68.3
The diagnosis of granuloma annulare is based on clinical or histopathologic findings.1 GA may be confused with other conditions with annular configuration such as tinea corporis, nummular eczema, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC), or cutaneous sarcoid.7,8 Tinea corporis, a dermatophyte infection, presents as a pruritic, annular erythematous patch or plaque with an overlying scale that spreads centrifugally. Nummular eczema classically consists of a coin-shaped plaque that is also pruritic and annular. This condition classically worsens in the dry, cold months and is seen in patients with atopy. SCLE presents with erythematous, annular scaling plaques in photodistributed areas.7 EAC presents as annular pink patches or plaques with characteristic “trailing” scales inside the border of the lesion.8 While tinea, nummular eczema, SCLE, and EAC all feature scaling, GA notably lacks scale. Lastly, cutaneous sarcoid can mimic GA clinically and histologically. Clinically, sarcoid demonstrates indurated erythematous plaques that can closely resemble subcutaneous GA.3 Patients with sarcoid often demonstrate bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, a finding that would not be seen with GA.8 At times, distinguishing sarcoid and GA is only possible histologically; typical sarcoid histology involves noncaseating “naked” (lacking a peripheral rim of lymphocytes) granulomas and does not feature the palisading pattern characteristic of GA.9
Granuloma annulare is often self-limited, especially if localized. If treatment is desired, high-potency topical or intralesional corticosteroids, topical tacrolimus, or cryosurgery may be tried.1,6 PUVA may also improve lesions, likely by inhibiting T-cell-dependent inflammation.6 Many systemic therapies have been attempted for generalized or disseminated GA, but none are universally effective; some agents include isotretinoin, antimalarials, niacinamide, and TNF-α inhibitors.1,6 While the spontaneous resolution of GA usually occurs within 2 years, there is a high rate of recurrence.1,3
The patient was deemed to have granuloma annulare, a generalized type. He was trialed on topical steroids but unfortunately, his granuloma annulare was refractory to this. As the lesions were not distressing to the patient, he opted for watchful waiting in hopes they might resolve spontaneously.
Which condition is NOT commonly associated with granuloma annular?
Correct answer is Hyperthyroidism

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/patient-dies-from-sepsis-after-refusing-to-go-to-hospital/,Patient With Cellulitis Dies From Sepsis After Refusing to Go to Hospital,"Ms M was a nurse practitioner in a walk-in urgent care facility where the high volume of patients could make work challenging. One busy morning in June, a new patient was seen with complaints of bilateral swelling, redness, and pain in his legs. The patient, Mr G, was a 55-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
Ms M noted in the chart that the patient’s leg swelling and pain began a week ago and that the patient stated that his leg feels warm. Mr G had no fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain, or cough. The patient was obese (BMI 39)  and had a history of aortic stenosis. The patient was taking atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril daily.
A physical examination revealed swelling, erythema, and heat in both lower extremities, without calf tenderness. Excoriated skin secondary to psoriasis was noted. Ms M told Mr G that she suspected he might have cellulitis and that it would be best for him to be evaluated in the hospital. The patient refused. Ms M noted the patient’s refusal in the chart. She then told the patient that she would like to order a Doppler ultrasound of his legs to rule out deep vein thrombosis.
“This could be indicative of a blood clot, which is very dangerous and needs to be treated urgently,” the clinician told the patient.  Again, the patient refused. Ms M noted in the chart “patient refuses this quite adamantly and angrily. He understands there is a risk if he has a blood clot and is not evaluated.”
The clinician gave the patient vancomycin, placed an IV infusion for hydration, and then released him. Mr G was advised to follow up with his primary care physician within 48 to 72 hours.
The following day the patient died of sepsis. Following his death, his widow sued Ms M, alleging medical malpractice and wrongful death. In particular, the plaintiff alleged that Ms M had failed to inform the patient of the risk of death by not getting evaluated at the hospital.
Ms M consulted with the attorney provided by her medical malpractice insurance. The attorney suggested they move to dismiss the case by making a motion for summary judgment. Summary judgment allows a judge to dismiss a case if the facts are not in dispute and only the issue of law needs to be decided.
Ms M’s attorney filed a motion asking that the court dismiss the case. As support for his argument, the attorney included the affirmation of a medical expert and a transcript of a deposition taken of Ms M. In the deposition, Ms M testified that before discharging Mr G from the urgent care, she informed the patient that he was suffering from cellulitis, a life-threatening infection that could lead to sepsis, and that he needed to be hospitalized, but that Mr G refused to go to the hospital. The medical expert relied on Ms M’s deposition testimony and concluded that she had met the standards of care.
The court agreed and dismissed the case against Ms M.
The plaintiff appealed the dismissal of the case to the appellate court. On appeal, the court sided with the plaintiff. The court noted that the expert had based his conclusions on Ms M’s deposition testimony, but that Ms M’s written assessment of the interaction differed from that testimony.
The medical records, noted the court, did not indicate that Ms M had informed the patient of the risk of sepsis, the risk of death, or that he needed to be hospitalized, although that is what she testified to at her deposition.
Because the information in the medical chart differed from Ms M’s testimony about what she told the patient, the court ruled that the case must proceed to trial where a jury can make a determination as to what happened. Summary judgment is never allowed in cases where there is a material issue of fact in dispute.
The case has been sent back to the lower court for further proceedings.
It is challenging to take detailed notes, especially when a patient is sitting there expectantly, and the waiting room is filled with a sea of other patients. But this case demonstrates how important it is, nonetheless.
The plaintiff’s argument, in this case, was that had Mr G known what his risks were, he would have made a different decision about going to the hospital or undergoing further tests. Ultimately though, there were only 2 people in the exam room. Thus, the medical records become especially important.
You can protect yourself by taking detailed notes, particularly about potentially dangerous outcomes. If you are warning a patient that they may be facing death by not having an exam or follow-up test, you must document this. Years later you may not remember exactly what you said to the patient, but the records will still exist.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/gina-2024-asthma-update/,"GINA 2024 Asthma Update: Revised Recommendations on Treatment, Goals, Remission","The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) has issued the 2024 update to its global strategy for asthma management and prevention report, as published on GINA’s website.
The GINA 2024 asthma update includes key changes on a number of topics, including:
Authored by the GINA Science Committee, the newly-released 2024 report also includes several updated sections, including the section on allergen immunotherapy. The guidance is intended for primary care practitioners, specialists, and other health care professionals.
GINA revised the diagnostic flowchart for adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 to 11 years presenting with chronic or recurrent respiratory symptoms in clinical practice. The flowchart includes guidance for measuring peak expiratory flow (PEF) for diagnosing asthma, in recognition of the fact that many health care providers do not have ready access to spirometry, the report authors noted. When PEF is used, the GINA Science Committee recommends using the best of 3 measurements each time and that the same meter should be used for follow-up testing, as measurements may be different from meter to meter by as much as 20%. The report authors also advise documenting evidence for an asthma diagnosis before initiation of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment.
Patients with cough variant asthma usually have normal spirometry, and the only abnormality in lung function may be airway hyper-responsiveness on bronchial provocation testing, the committee noted. Most of these patients have sputum eosinophilia, and they may have increased fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). The usual recommendations for asthma are advised in patients with cough variant asthma.
GINA advises that providers assess patients’ symptom control for the previous 4 weeks or longer and identify other potential risk factors for exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation, or side effects. The updated report also recommends measuring lung function at diagnosis or treatment initiation, 3 to 6 months after beginning ICS therapy, and then periodically and more frequently in at-risk patients and for those with severe asthma. Risk factors for exacerbations include short-acting beta 2 agonist (SABA) overuse, inadequate ICS, other medical conditions, exposures such as smoking and air pollution, psychosocial factors, lung function, and type 2 inflammatory markers. For assessing symptom control, clinicians are advised to inquire about their patients’ frequency of asthma symptoms, any night waking or limitation of activity, and the frequency of symptom relief in those using SABA.
From a clinical perspective, the long-term goal of asthma management is to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients, including symptom control and minimizing exacerbation risk, according to the committee. “It is also important to elicit the patient’s (or parent/caregiver’s) goals regarding their asthma, as these may differ from medical goals,” the committee stated.
In childhood asthma, the most important predictors of remission are fewer, milder, or decreasing frequency of symptomatic episodes, good or improving lung function, and less airway hyper-responsiveness. Risk factors for persistence of asthma in children include atopy, parental asthma/allergy, later onset of symptoms, wheezing without a cold, and maternal smoking or tobacco smoke exposure. For adults with asthma, predictors of remission on treatment with biologic therapy for severe asthma include improved short-term asthma symptom control, improved lung function, fewer comorbidities, earlier onset, and no or lower baseline maintenance oral corticosteroid (OCS) use. For remission off treatment in adults, predictors of clinical persistence are moderate-to-severe airway hyper-responsiveness and nasal polyps.
Recommendations for initial asthma treatment in adults and adolescents include key changes in tracks 1 and 2. In the preferred initial treatment (track 1), as-needed-only low-dose ICS-formoterol is preferred in steps 1 and 2. Low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) is preferred for step 3. Medium-dose ICS-formoterol MART is preferred in step 4 for patients who have daily asthma symptoms, wake at night with asthma at least once per week, and have low lung function. For step 5, it is recommended that patients with severe asthma be referred for expert assessment, phenotyping, and add-on treatment. As alternative initial treatment (track 2), it is preferred that patients with infrequent symptoms take ICS when SABA is taken vs daily ICS plus as-needed SABA; this ensures that patients receive at least some ICS.
Additional guidance regarding medications and doses for track 1 anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy have been provided. Recommendations include use of relevant ICS-formoterol devices (dry-powder inhalers and pressurized metered-dose inhalers) and doses for AIR therapy, according to age group and treatment step, as well as the corresponding dosing regimens and maximum number of inhalations to be taken in 1 day.
Among other treatment options, before prescribing montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, GINA advises that clinicians assess the benefits and risks and counsel patients or their parents/caregivers about the risk of neuropsychiatric events.
Using a combination of high-dose ICS-long-acting beta 2 agonists (LABA) can be considered in adults and adolescents, although the increase in ICS usually provides little added benefit, noted the report authors. GINA recommends that a high dose only be used on a trial basis for 3 to 6 months when good asthma control is not achieved with medium-dose MART with ICS-formoterol or medium-dose ICS plus LABA and/or a third controller.
Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) may be used as add-on treatment in a separate inhaler for patients aged 6 years and older or in a triple combination inhaler for patients aged 18 years and older in cases when asthma is persistently uncontrolled with medium or high-dose ICS-LABA. The addition of a LAMA to medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA may modestly improve lung function but not symptoms, according to the committee.
For patients receiving ongoing treatment for severe asthma who have had a good response to type 2 target therapy, GINA recommends re-evaluating the need for each asthma medication every 3 to 6 months and emphasizes that the patients should not completely stop their ICS-containing therapy. Minimizing OCS use is a high priority, and the committee advises gradually decreasing or stopping OCS first owing to significant adverse effects. If a patient’s asthma is well controlled, ceasing other therapies can be considered.
For adults and adolescents with well-controlled asthma, stepping down treatment can be considered. The committee advises that stepping down can occur when symptoms are well controlled and lung function has been stable for at least 3 months. For patients with a risk for exacerbations, stepping down treatment should be done only with close supervision. GINA advises engaging patients in the process, documenting their asthma status, providing clear instructions and a written action plan, ensuring that the patients have sufficient medication to resume their previous dose if needed, monitoring symptoms, and scheduling a follow-up visit. “Stepping down ICS doses by 25% to 50% at 3-month intervals is feasible and safe for most patients,” the committee stated.
Initial asthma treatment recommendations in children aged 6 to 11 years also have been updated. Symptom levels and lung function for initial treatment steps are similar to those for adults and adolescents. Additional details have been provided about studies, populations, and outcomes in this age group. For children aged 6 to 11 years with asthma symptoms that are well controlled on low-dose ICS or are using SABA alone and have symptoms occurring less frequently than twice per week, GINA recommends ICS whenever SABA is taken.
Infrequent asthma symptoms are now regarded as occurring 1 to 2 days per week or less; the preferred initial treatment is low-dose ICS whenever SABA is taken, in combination or separate inhalers. For children with asthma symptoms occurring 2 to 5 days per week, the preferred initial treatment is low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA. For children aged 6 to 11 years who have daily asthma symptoms, wake at night once or more per week, and have low lung function, the preferred initial treatment is medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, or low-dose ICS-formoterol MART.
For children whose initial asthma presentation is during an acute exacerbation, the preferred initial approach is to treat as for an exacerbation, including a short course of OCS if the exacerbation is severe, and then to commence step 3 or step 4 treatment and schedule follow-up.
Report authors updated the section on allergen immunotherapy after doinga a systematic review for articles on subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for asthma. For clinicians considering using SCIT for adults or children with asthma, GINA advises weighing the potential benefits compared with pharmacologic treatment and allergen avoidance against the risk for adverse effects and inconvenience and cost of a longer course of treatment, which is usually 3 to 5 years. Also, SCIT should not be initiated until the patient has good asthma control, according to the guidance.
For adults or adolescents with asthma who are sensitized to house dust mite (HDM) and have persisting asthma symptoms despite low- to medium-dose ICS-containing treatment, clinicians may consider adding HDM SLIT, but only when forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is more than 70% predicted, the guidance states. Among children with asthma who are sensitized to ragweed, SLIT may be added before and during the ragweed season if FEV1 is 80% predicted or more.
Among other changes, mild asthma is regarded as a retrospective label and cannot be used to determine which patients may receive step 1 or 2 treatment. Evidence supports use of structured outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programs for improving patients’ functional exercise capacity and quality of life. Also, a new section has been provided on preventing occupational asthma in adults, as 5% to 20% of new cases of adult-onset asthma may be attributed to occupational exposure. Patients who have suspected or confirmed occupational asthma should be referred for expert assessment owing to the economic and legal implications, according to the committee.
As with previous GINA reports, the 2024 report is based on a twice annual update of the evidence, which forms the basis for the recommendations made by the GINA Science Committee. The committee, which is comprised of leaders in adult and pediatric asthma research, performed a full-text review for 64 publications, of which 34 publications were discussed at committee meetings.
As the committee noted in the newly released 2024 report, “When asthma care is consistent with evidence-based recommendations, outcomes improve.” They further added, “This strategy report is a resource document for health care professionals, intended to set out the main goals of asthma treatment and the actions required to ensure their fulfillment, as well as to facilitate the achievement of standards for quality asthma care.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/alzheimer-disease-management_qa/,"Alzheimer Disease Management: Q&A With Theresa Sivers-Teixeira, PA-C","An estimated 6.7 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. To help understand the current status of clinical management in primary care, The Clinical Advisor interviewed Theresa Sivers-Teixeira, PA-C, following her presentation “Empowering Primary Care Management of Alzheimer Disease Post Diagnosis: Person-Centered Care in a Changing Landscape,” at the 2024 annual meeting of the American Academy of Physician Associates in Houston, Texas. Sivers-Teixeira is an Instructor of Clinical Family Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine University of Southern California.
Mobility is one of the 4 Ms of Age-Friendly healthcare (the others: what matters to the patient, medications, and mentation). Focusing on mobility is critical to maintaining a patient’s autonomy and dignity. What are some potential ways to optimize mobility in a patient who may not be enthusiastic about moving?
PA Sivers-Teixeira: The first thing I want to do is be curious. I want to understand what their experience has been with falls, near falls, and fear of falling.  Are there barriers to increasing daily movement or physical therapy therapy?  Sometimes I hear comments like I haven’t fallen yet, but I’m afraid of falling in my home because I’m dizzy; or I don’t want to get up because I get confused; or I don’t want to go to physical therapy because I have incontinence and it’s too hard to get to a bathroom. If I know what the barriers are, that helps set me up to have a conversation with the patient and their family.
I try to find out what their goals are in terms of daily activity and function. What do they like to do? Maybe they used to love gardening but can’t do it anymore, or they used to enjoy going to museums, or they want to go to a grandchild’s graduation. I try to use those valued activities as leverage points. Then I try to adapt gait and stability training to improve function for valued activities with support from my occupational therapy and physical therapy colleagues. I find that if we can collaborate on a meaningful functional goal that might include environmental adaptations, I am more successful in motivating patient and caregiver’s participation which, in turn, increases mobility and reduces fall risk.
For example, I have people that say, “I’ve never liked to exercise” or “I don’t like to go out much.” I ask what music they liked to listen to when they were young. For people living with dementia, music is often a gateway to longterm memories that are still intact. That deep connection to our coming-of-age music is pretty profound. I ask the caregiver to find music that lifts the mood and inspires some movement.  Chair dancing is a thing! For my mom, it was Johnny Mathis and Elvis Presley who inspired her to sing along as she kicked her legs to the beat and waved her hands in the air from her wheelchair. I danced to it and we both had fun.
What kind of support for the caregiver is typically most helpful in providing the appropriate care and treatment of the person with dementia?
PA Sivers-Teixeira: Caregiving for a person living with progressive dementia is a tremendously difficult job, and I say that not only as somebody who has collaborated with caregivers for decades now but also as a caregiver of my mother who recently passed away from a dementing illness. Nobody prepares you for it.
Many families have multiple caregivers. The very first thing I do when people have a new diagnosis is connect the patient and family to a community agency that can provide ongoing caregiver education on the disease. People need help understanding what to expect with disease progression, practical caregiving strategies, and available resources to provide ongoing support. Participation in caregiver support groups highly correlates with an improved caregiver sense of well-being. There are excellent education programs in most states.  Using the free ElderCare locator with a zip code will identify in-person and virtual resources and provide a phone number to call for those who aren’t able to use a computer. Additionally, the Alzheimer’s Association is a national organization that lists local resources.
As this disease progresses, caregiver burden and risk of burnout increase. It is essential that we identify caregiver stress by checking in with caregivers and refer them to social work or other community-based organizations as needed. Social workers can provide targeted resources, and strategies for reducing stress, and may be trained in care mapping. This involves creatively thinking about personal and community resources that may have not been considered in the past.  Do they belong to a church? Do they have financial resources? Is there a good friend that can come by for 2 hours weekly to give the caregiver a break?
Often caregivers expect that they should do all of the caregiving because they love the person and they see it as their role. It’s often a spouse — usually a wife — who thinks they can do everything. At first, that might be true, but as the disease progresses and the functioning of their loved one decreases, the burden of care increases drastically.
Do you recommend that primary care providers prescribe monoclonal antibodies at this time, given the relatively small effects on cognition/function and the logistical complexity of administration?
PA Sivers-Teixeira: We are living in a time of extraordinary innovations for disease-modifying treatment driven by decades of research. Scientists are getting closer to identifying the proteins that most impact disease progression and loss of neurological function. The currently available monoclonal antibody, lecanemab [Leqembi], targets an amyloid protein and is administered by infusion. In studies, the drug has dramatically lowered the presence of a specific amyloid protein in the brain associated with dementia but only had a limited clinical effect on participants. Only individuals who are identified very early in the disease are candidates for lecanemab. Other barriers include the expense of treatment and the burden of weekly infusions. Additionally, people who are homozygous APOE 4 carriers are not eligible for lecanemab due to an increased risk of brain bleeds. It is estimated about 15% of people who have Alzheimer’s disease are homozygous APOE4 carriers.
These caveats don’t take away from the amazing progress that Lecanamab and other monoclonal antibodies represent.  The limited cognitive and functional benefits and need for very early disease identification do not make this a good choice for the majority of our patients currently living with AD.  The way these new treatments impact primary care PAs the most is that all of these promising disease-modifying monoclonal antibodies require early detection which means robust screening and detection of cognitive impairment in primary care settings. As PAs, we need to become competent and confident with these clinical skills. We are going to face questions about these new treatments.  We need to know which patients may qualify and create reasonable patient and family expectations. If someone is potentially a good candidate for this treatment, they should be referred to a neurologist for further evaluation and genotyping.
In your experience, what is the greatest area of potential learning and development for PAs who care for patients with Alzheimer disease?
PA Sivers-Teixeira: When I gave this presentation, I asked everybody in the room how many people had taken care of an older adult who they either suspected had dementia or who was diagnosed with a dementing illness. Far more than half the people raised their hands. And when I asked how many people felt confident to manage the primary care of Alzheimer disease as a chronic disease, only 2 people put their hands up.
That’s our challenge. Our population is aging in the US. Approximately 6.7 million people have been diagnosed with a dementing illness today. It is estimated that 13.8 million people will have dementing illnesses by 2060, based on the growth of our aging population. There aren’t enough neurologists, geriatricians, or geropsychologists to care for the number of people who are living with a dementing illness. Primary care providers are a key part of screening and early detection of cognitive impairment. We have to be comfortable doing workups to rule out reversible causes and order appropriate imaging before referring to overbooked neurologists and geriatricians.
For our patients and families who are living with dementia, we need to collaborate with the patient and family to understand their preferences and values for short and longterm care planning. It is important to monitor for changes in function and caregiving needs. Special attention to managing medical issues that impact quality of life is essential. Some of these include polypharmacy, high-risk medication use, depression, falls/fall risk, incontinence, isolation, agitation, and caregiver stress. We need to understand the increased risk of delirium with infection and hospitalization in these patients and educate families to understand the symptoms. Appropriate referrals to specialists should include notes on preferences, function (ADLs  IADLs, cognition), and identified surrogate decision makers for healthcare.
Interprofessional team-based care is the most effective approach for patients living with dementia. The good news is we’re trained in team-based care! It is important to develop a team whether you have access to this in your health care or just your conceptual understanding and practical contact list of key t specialists and other professionals who can contribute to the quality of life for the older adult living with dementia.
I think the most practical paradigm uses an Age-Friendly, person-centered lens to manage acute and chronic disease and create/adapt care plans that optimize function and quality of life for someone living with dementia. This model drives the focus of chronic disease care plan priorities based on what matters in the daily life of the patient and family.","Amna Ahmad, MPhil; Nikki Kean"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/factor-xa-and-factor-xi-inhibitors-what-lies-ahead-for-anticoagulants/,Factor Xa and Factor XI Inhibitors: What Lies Ahead for Anticoagulants,"Unfractionated heparin is considered the oldest anticoagulant. Jay Mclean, a medical student at John Hopkins University, discovered it in 1916 while conducting prothrombic research using dog heart and liver extracts. Through the 1930s, unfractionated heparin was effectively purified in the laboratory and gradually introduced to prevent clotting in humans. Then, starting in the 1970s, scientists gained a better understanding of heparin’s mechanism of action. Its ability to promote antithrombin activity (inhibiting thrombin and factor Xa) set the stage for some of the more targeted medications available today.1
Around the same period as heparin’s discovery, vitamin K antagonists emerged, first as a lethal toxin and, ultimately, into a lifesaving treatment. After years of investigation, Karl Link’s team extracted the vitamin K antagonist, dicumarol, from spoiled sweet clover hay that was responsible for fatal bleeding deaths in herds of cattle from local farms in Wisconsin. The researchers synthesized dicumarol to kill rodents. Within 30 years, clinicians were using vitamin K antagonists to prevent coagulation for medical treatment in humans. The derivative, warfarin, was named after the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Warfarin gained popularity due to its ability to be taken by mouth versus injection.1
Fast-forward to recent decades, a group of drugs targeting factor Xa of the coagulation pathway has ushered in a more specific process for reducing coagulation. In addition, various factor XI inhibitors are making their way through clinical trials. They are slated to fill gaps for a growing number of patients who are not well-suited for other available anticoagulants.
Research suggests the global anticoagulant market is predicted to reach $32.14 billion this year, with a compound annual growth rate of 6.75%. By 2028, the market is expected to climb to $41.74 billion. The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including factor Xa inhibitors, is growing worldwide, but the United States holds the lion’s share of revenue from these brand-name drugs.2
However, as approved generics sit waiting in the wings, several factor Xa inhibitors face impending patent expirations that are predicted to improve affordability and enable greater access. In addition, the new frontier of clinical trials on factor XI inhibitors brings more opportunities to tailor anticoagulation therapy for specific groups.
Arixtra (fondaparinux) has been available in generic form since 2011. This low-molecular weight heparin is an indirect factor Xa inhibitor administered via subcutaneous injection.
Additionally, 4 DOACs are becoming preferred treatment options. These include the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban (XARELTO®), apixaban (ELIQUIS®), and edoxaban (SAVAYSA®), as well as dabigatran (Pradaxa®), which targets thrombin.1 These small, rapidly absorbed synthetic molecules improve outcomes during ischemic events and lower the risk for major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhages.1,3
While not recommended for patients with kidney disease, user-friendly DOACs are a convenient and effective option for many patients.4 Some typical challenges remain (like bleeding risk and high renal clearance). Nonetheless, these drugs offer critical advantages over vitamin K antagonists. They have a faster onset and offset of action, fewer medication and dietary interactions, fixed dosages, and do not require laboratory monitoring.1
As a result, they’re suitable for testing in vulnerable populations, particularly pediatric patients. The EINSTEIN Junior Study tested the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban in over 500 children with venous thromboembolism over 4 years. The results demonstrated a similar safety and efficacy as standard anticoagulation therapies.1
Several factor Xa inhibitors have highly anticipated patent expirations that will enable the release of approved generics, lowering drug prices and increasing access. Many of the previously set expiration dates have been extended. In addition, multiple patents are associated with each drug indication, so the patent expiration for pediatric use, for instance, is generally later than the patent for adult versions of medication.
The first one is rivaroxaban, which had a patent originally set to expire on February 8, 2021. This patent was extended by 1356 days, so it is now set to expire on October 26, 2024. Next, dabigatran’s patent is due to expire on September 7, 2025. Apixaban’s patent wasinitially scheduled to expire on February 3, 2023, but then it was extended by 1526 days. That leaves the new expiration date as April 9, 2027.5 Finally, edoxaban has patent expiration dates onApril 18, 2027, and March 28, 2028.6
In addition to patents, drugs may be subject to exclusivity laws that limit their production and distribution. According to the FDA, the current laws are “designed to promote a balance between new drug innovation and greater public access to drugs that result from generic drug competition.”7 Fortunately, progress continues as a new class of anticoagulants line up to enter the market.
DOACs represent notable progress in anticoagulation therapy, an area of study that is well over a century in the making. However, treatment can still be optimized to carryover the benefits of DOACs while addressing existing gaps, including the risk for bleeding and contraindications in renal patients. As a result, forward-thinking researchers are exploring the potential to target other aspects of the coagulation cascade, particularly factor XI. With a lower bleeding risk and the potential for higher dosages, XI inhibitors are promising options for frail patients and those with cancer.1
Abelacimab is a human monoclonal antibody currently being compared to apixaban in a phase 3 clinical trial. The trial is looking at venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence and bleeding in a group of patients with cancer-associated VTE. Abelacimab is administered parentally every month (compared to twice daily oral administration of apixaban), reducing the burden on patients who have trouble swallowing and a high risk of nausea and vomiting. The current trial has 1655 enrolled participants and is due to be completed in 2025.8
An oral factor XI inhibitor, milvexian, is being studied in two phase 3 trials with an estimated 15,000 (in the LIBREXIA-STROK trial) and 16,000 (in the LIBREXIA-ACS trial) enrolled participants. These trials are placebo-controlled interventions evaluating the safety and efficacy of milvexian (a small molecule) for stroke prevention following acute ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack, and acute coronary syndrome. The clinical trial for acute ischemic stroke is estimated to complete December 2026 and the clinical trial for acute coronary syndrome is estimated to complete October 2026.9
Bayer is also recruiting patients for an ongoing phase 3 study on their small molecule factor XI inhibitor, asundexian. They are measuring asundexian’s ability to prevent strokes after an acute ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack compared to placebo. The study is estimated to finish in October 2025 with 9300 participants.10
Additional factor XI inhibitors currently under investigation include:
The primary study groups have end-stage renal disease or major orthopedic surgery.3 Although the risks and benefits of factor XI inhibitors are promising, it is still too early to know if they will live up to their reputation as the latest innovation in anticoagulation therapy. With more patients at risk, it is clear that the race among pharmaceutical companies is not slowing down anytime soon.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/adolescent-substance-use-treatment-how-can-we-expand-access-and-support-pcps/,Adolescent Substance Use Treatment: How Can We Expand Access and Support PCPs?,"Amidst an ongoing epidemic of drug overdose deaths in the United States,1 the demand for accessible and affordable adolescent substance use treatment in 2024 is likely to be greater than ever before. Yet, a recent National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported study2 has confirmed what so many American families are already facing first-hand: adolescent access to essential substance use disorders (SUDs) treatment facilities is only getting more complex.
According to the NIH study, only half (54%) of residential treatment facilities – live-in care centers that offer essential treatment for SUDs – have an available bed for adolescent patients with opioid use disorder (OUD).2 Even when beds are available, costs are often prohibitive, with an average monthly reported cost of treatment of over $26,000.2
In the face of such scarce resources, alternative models are essential to expand care access and support earlier intervention for OUD and SUDs more broadly. Searching for a residential treatment program or facility for adolescents often requires diligence, patience, and a substantial financial investment. As noted in the NIH study, almost half of the programs contacted by researchers asked for up-front payment from self-pay patients before admission, and the average cost per day of the facilities providing cost information was $878.2
These costs are a major barrier for many patients, families, and caregivers – especially those who are already underserved by mental health and behavioral health resources. Vulnerable populations are disproportionately at risk, as Hispanic and Black adolescents have experienced the most significant increase in drug overdose deaths in recent years.3
Given the major barriers patients face in accessing residential facilities for adolescent substance use treatment, researchers and clinicians suggest that better support for primary care providers (PCPs) can aid in the early identification and management of SUD among children and adolescents.
As noted by the NIH study authors, PCPs are integral to expanding treatment access for patients, particularly in under-served areas.2 As the first clinical point of contact for many children and adolescents, PCPs play a crucial role in identifying and addressing SUDs through screening for OUD during physicals and well-child visits.
As with other health conditions, early intervention through primary care can help address SUDs and prevent progression into more severe cases – which ultimately require more specialized and costly treatment options. In the case of OUD, previous research has demonstrated that interventions to improve PCPs’ comfort in prescribing buprenorphine – a first-line treatment for OUD – to adolescents could expand access and improve long-term recovery prospects.2
The establishment of child psychiatry access programs (CPAPs) as a national care model supports this goal of informing and empowering PCPs to treat adolescent SUDs. Through federal, state, and alternative funding sources, CPAPs are state-based services that provide specialty mental and behavioral health education, care coordination, and consultation to PCPs managing child and adolescent patients.
The 5 key elements of CPAPs are as follows:4
Operating across 47 states,5 CPAPs stretch available child and adolescent psychiatric care resources by enabling PCPs to deliver more specialized care. A recent review of available evidence on CPAPs found that several studies identified an improvement in PCP knowledge and skill, as well as self-efficacy in managing mental health conditions in primary care, after using CPAP services.6
Historically, CPAPs have primarily focused on non-substance-related mental and behavioral health conditions,6 yet SUDs are often a co-occurring element of adolescent mental health care. Having already expanded services to maternal mental health care through perinatal access programs,7 some state access programs are looking to increase specialty resources for adolescent substance use treatment.
By connecting PCPs with specialty care and referral resources, SUD access programs offer the potential to scale resources and deliver affordable, accessible early interventions that are so direly needed for adolescents and families who are struggling with substance use.
Policy measures are already being explored to ensure a higher baseline comfort level among all providers in managing SUDs. In 2021, the US House of Representatives introduced the Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act of 2021 which requires all physicians without specialty board certification in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry – including PCPs and many psychiatrists – to undergo additional substance use training.8
From 2013 to 2022, only 759 physicians were certified in addiction psychiatry and 3916 in addiction medicine.9 Given the scarcity of addiction specialists in the US, such interventions are likely a welcome step in upskilling both PCPs and the many psychiatrists who do not have specialty addiction medicine training.
This also highlights the distinctive role that CPAPs can play in supporting community care for SUDs. Child and adolescent psychiatrists who are enrolled in the access program may be best utilized in supporting PCPs who do not have specialty addiction training with the many psychiatric comorbidities and social factors that often accompany SUDs.
Moving forward, efforts to staff CPAPs with addiction psychiatrists will be vital in expanding community access to specialty training, particularly for complex cases that neither PCPs nor general child and adolescent psychiatrists can manage. Accessibility to licensed social workers with SUD expertise and insight will be invaluable for optimal care coordination, ensuring PCPs are directed to the appropriate specialty addiction services in the community.
If such initiatives are to succeed, increased funding from state and federal agencies will be critical for improved patient outcomes. In February of this year, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) announced a commitment of $28 million in funding opportunities to support expanded treatment services for SUDs – a significant investment into programs of this nature.10 This funding source offers increased resources through adult and family treatment courts and pilot programs for pregnant and postpartum women. Similar funding for adolescent substance use treatment – including support for specialty addiction medicine and/or psychiatry training and staffing resources – will be essential to adequately address existing care gaps.
With the incidence of SUD-related harm and mortality outstripping the availability of care, digital systems that facilitate increased connectivity between providers are increasingly important.  As one piece of the care system puzzle, these platforms can integrate complex SUD care, allowing providers to devote essential time and resources to the adolescents who need it most.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/diversity-challenges-in-clinical-trials-of-alzheimer-disease-and-related-dementias/,Diversity Challenges in Clinical Trials of Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias,"Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have increasingly become a focus across businesses, educational institutions, and health care organizations, sparking important conversations and encouraging the passage of laws that mandate efforts be made for more representation, especially in clinical trials of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD).
In December 2022, the Food and Drug Omnibus Report Act of 2022 (FDORA) was enacted as an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FDC) Act and the Public Health Service (PHS) Act.1 Its passage mandated the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft certain informational documents, such as public reports and strategic plans,2 as well as industry guidance designed to increase the enrollment of ethnoracially diverse populations in clinical trials and studies.1
By January 2024, the FDA published draft guidance regarding the collection of race and ethnicity data in clinical trials and studies for FDA-regulated medical products. The guidance recommended that sponsors of investigational drugs and devices enroll participants that reflect the target population most likely to use the FDA-approved product,3 encouraging the enrollment of underrepresented populations.
According to research, individuals of Hispanic/Latino or African descent vs White individuals are at a higher risk for developing ADRD.4,5 However, they are routinely underrepresented in clinical trials.
In 2021, the FDA fast-tracked aducanumab (Aduhelm®) for approval as a treatment for AD.6 Aducanumab became the first new FDA-approved treatment for AD in over 20 years of research and development. The multinational clinical trials (ENGAGE and EMERGE) were designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aducanumab, however, the population included extraordinarily low proportions of patients with African (0.6%) or Hispanic/Latino (3.2%) ancestry.7
Researchers published a systematic review of the literature in 2022 and included 101 clinical trials for AD in their final analysis. They reported that AD trial participants consisted predominantly White individuals (median percentage, 94.7%). When analyzing temporal trends, this percentage did not increase or decrease significantly between 2001 and 2019.8
Clinical investigators continue to struggle with increasing diversity in AD clinical trials, begging the question of why?
We spoke with 3 clinical trial investigators with expertise in AD who revealed that the existing barriers to diversity and equity in AD clinical trials are multilayered and complex.
The very nature of AD poses a challenge to patient recruitment for clinical trials. Compared with people with conditions that do not impact cognitive functioning, those with ADRD have more difficulties independently researching treatment options and making decisions about participating in clinical trials.
Marissa Natelson Love, MD, a neurologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who specializes in behavioral medicine and memory and cognitive disorders at a tertiary referral center, expounded upon several key issues that have affected diversity in her AD clinical trials.
“A big issue is under-referral of at-risk ethnoracially diverse populations to our center,” Dr Love explained. “This may be due to lack of recognition by or referral from primary care physicians (PCPs) or other neurologists who send patients to us for a second opinion. It is also possible that caregivers and family members are simply not bringing their concerns of dementia to the attention of their loved one’s doctor or not requesting a referral to dementia specialists.”
Dr Love also shared that she has encountered differences in cultural perspectives on aging. “Western cultures value independent living whereas other cultures value communal living, such that several generations of family members live in the same household, providing older adults with the care and support that people of Western cultures may not always have.”
She also acknowledged that the nature of AD may be a barrier to recruitment due to the cognitive impairment experienced and the greater social support needed for participants in AD trials compared with other clinical trials.
“Study partners can more accurately report participant medical histories, current symptoms, and any noticeable symptom improvements while the participants undergo ADRD-related treatment. But not everyone with ADRD has this type of strong social support network,” Dr Love noted.
Norman Foster, MD, a geriatric neurologist and professor emeritus from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, has specialized in brain imaging and neurodegenerative diseases and dementia for more than 30 years. Dr Foster explained how financial disincentives, insurance barriers, and lack of resources can impact diversity and equity in clinical trials, as well as in clinical care.
“There is always this tension between profit motive and philanthropic motive in medicine, and it is an increasingly difficult tension … There is the issue of whether aducanumab is cost-effective, but also the issue of whether the medication itself is truly effective,” he said.
Dr Foster emphasized that although that aducanumab for AD received FDA approval, Medicare decided not to reimburse the treatment because the clinical trials were conducted in populations that were not reflective of the diversity of the general Medicare population. “Historically, justification to deny treatment reimbursement based on lack of clinical trial diversity has affected treatment only for those with AD and not for people with other conditions, despite the same lack of clinical trial diversity. Additionally, Medicare does not reimburse intravenous infusions [like aducanumab] to the same extent as private insurers,” he noted.9
These financial and insurance disincentives result in barriers to treatment accessibility and willingness to administer or even fund the research and development of these types of treatments. As such, Biogen, the manufacturer of aducanumab, has announced that it is discontinuing production of the drug to “reprioritize its resources” in AD, but for reasons not attributable to safety or efficacy.6
“Quality care of AD requires a multidisciplinary team approach, but those teams are difficult to construct. New treatments really require a change in paradigm, logistics, and infrastructure to meet the needs of high-quality dementia care,” Dr Foster said.
Ganesh Babulal, PhD, an associate professor of neurology in the division of aging and dementia at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, has authored several articles related to diversity in AD drug trials.8,10-12 Dr Babulal has frequently discussed the structural barriers and social determinants of health (SDOH) that not only influence health care equity, affordability of treatment, and treatment response, but also deter socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic diversity in ADRD clinical trials.
“Life expectancy is increasing on a large scale globally. We will inevitably see increases in cases of dementia and AD. Researchers have investigated the increased risk for ADRD and its particularly high prevalence in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs),” Dr Babulal said.
“The Lancet Commission’s piece on dementia prevention, intervention, and care stated that 40% of worldwide dementias are explained by 12 modifiable risk factors.13 The first on the list of 12 is childhood education, followed by air pollution, depression, hypertension, and smoking. Each modifiable risk factor is related to lifestyle and an understanding of brain health.”
Dr Babulal explained that approximately 11% to 12% of clinical trials for ADRDs have been conducted in LMICs “due to the larger up-front investment needed from pharmaceutical companies and the industry as a whole.” He believes that increased representation from LMICs, who are more at-risk for developing these conditions, can help clinicians determine exactly why there is an increased risk among certain ethnoracial groups for ADRD.
“It is really not just due to genetics. We are finding out more and more that there are SDOH that contribute to this higher risk. Access to quality health care, healthy foods, and resources would benefit brain health. These lifestyle and environmental factors play a role in the development and progression of ADRD,” Dr Babulal said.
He added, “Lack of diversity in clinical trials can lead to treatments that are less effective or even harmful for individuals in certain groups. It widens the gap by perpetuating a new source of health disparity. A treatment that is effective for one group is not necessarily effective for others.”
Researchers who conducted a cross-sectional study of 568,368 community-based Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older found that SDOH explained between 10% and 13% of ethnic and racial disparities in ADRD care.14
“One of the most prominent factors leading to overrepresentation of non-Hispanic White patients in clinical trials is the pervasive mistrust of clinical research and health care systems among minoritized communities stemming from past unethical practices, as well as systemic inequalities and racism,” Dr Babulal continued.
“Cultural differences, misconceptions, and stigma surrounding ADRD may also contribute to low participation rates in clinical trials among many communities … Addressing concerns well before enrollment and providing a certain level of transparency is critical.”
The barriers that make it difficult to recruit diverse patients for AD clinical trials are complex and multifaceted, requiring significant efforts be made in the hopes of achieving well-balanced representation.
Dr Foster and his AD clinical trial teams tried to improve diversity by establishing outreach clinics in predominately African American and rural communities and by engaging with underserved populations, including Native American, Hispanic, and Polynesian patient populations. Efforts such as educating Spanish-speaking providers and social workers were particularly effective.
Similarly, Dr Babulal found that establishing a knowledgeable clinical trial team reflective of the community was another effective means of recruiting diverse patients.
“There is a science of recruitment and community engagement that must be funded,” he explained. “The trial team must tailor the message to the community, carefully considering the culture, language, and geography when developing educational materials.”
His clinical trial team provides free educational sessions in the community to address concerns, answer questions, and spread awareness. His organization has also participated in community health fairs and screenings.
All 3 clinical trial investigators emphasized the importance of engaging and educating trusted individuals, leaders, and organizations within these specific communities, including religious organizations and federally qualified health centers that provide services to underserved populations.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/antiseizure-medication-use-for-epilepsy-during-pregnancy-new-expert-guidance/,Antiseizure Medication Use for Epilepsy During Pregnancy: New Expert Guidance,"The American Academy of Neurology (AAN), American Epilepsy Society (AES), and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) published an updated practice guideline in Neurology on teratogenesis, perinatal, and neurodevelopmental outcomes related to antiseizure medication (ASM) use in people with epilepsy who are pregnant.
In March 2018, a multidisciplinary panel was recruited to conduct a systematic review and develop the protocol for this guideline following the previous issuance of 2 relevant guidelines in 2009. After searching several databases from June 2007 to August 2022, the panel identified 82 articles for inclusion.
Researchers aimed to characterize the prevalence of major congenital malformations (MCMs), adverse perinatal outcomes, and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with intrauterine exposure to specific ASMs among children born to people with epilepsy of childbearing potential. They also sought to understand how prevalence may vary with monotherapy vs polytherapy and high doses vs low or medium doses.
Further, the researchers aimed to explore the effect of intrauterine exposure to folic acid on the prevalence of MCMs, as well as adverse perinatal and neurodevelopment outcomes, and understand how this varies by folic acid dose in children born to people with epilepsy of childbearing potential who received ASMs.
This updated guidance provides up-to-date evidence-based conclusions and recommendations for clinicians to effectively manage the treatment of patients with epilepsy during pregnancy.
The selection of an ASM should be a joint decision between clinician and patient, and patient preferences should be taken into account. The optimal dose of an ASM prioritizes seizure control and fetal outcomes, should pregnancy occur.
In people with epilepsy of childbearing potential, clinicians must minimize the occurrence of convulsive seizures during pregnancy. In pregnant patients, clinicians should exercise caution when removing or replacing an ASM that is effectively controlling a patient’s seizures, even if it may not be optimal for the fetus.
Throughout pregnancy, ASM levels in people with epilepsy of childbearing potential should be monitored by clinicians.
Adjusting the dose of an ASM may be necessary when serum ASM levels are decreasing or when seizure control worsens.
Clinicians should inform patients of the limited data that exists on pregnancy-related outcomes when prescribing acetazolamide, eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, lacosamide, nitrazepam, perampanel, piracetam, pregabalin, rufinamide, stiripentol, tiagabine, or vigabatrin.
Patients with epilepsy of childbearing potential should be informed by clinicians that the birth prevalence of any MCM in the general population is 2.4% to 2.9%, which provides a comparison framework for their individual risk.
Based on the patient’s epilepsy syndrome and the likelihood of achieving seizure control, and comorbidities, clinicians must consider the use of lamotrigine, levetiracetam, or oxcarbazepine in people with epilepsy of childbearing potential to reduce the risk for MCMs.
If clinically feasible, the use of valproic acid in people with epilepsy of childbearing potential must be avoided by clinicians to minimize the risk of MCMs or neural tube defects.
People with epilepsy of childbearing potential who are treated with or are considering starting valproic acid must be informed by clinicians that the risk for any MCM is the highest with valproic acid vs other studied ASMs.
If clinically feasible, clinicians must avoid the use of phenobarbital in people with epilepsy of childbearing potential to reduce the risk for cardiac malformations and should avoid the use of phenobarbital and topiramate in the same population to reduce the risk for oral clefts.
Furthermore, clinicians should avoid the use of valproic acid in this patient population to reduce the risk for urogenital and renal malformations.
The prevalence of intrauterine death does not differ among different ASMs exposures in monotherapy.
The use of valproic acid or topiramate in people with epilepsy of childbearing potential should be avoided to minimize the risk of offspring being born small for gestational age.
Obstetricians should recommend screening of fetal growth over the entire course of pregnancy among people with epilepsy of childbearing potential who are treated with valproic acid or topiramate to enable early identification of fetal growth restriction.
Obstetricians should recommend fetal screening for MCMs (eg, a detailed anatomical ultrasound) for people with epilepsy of childbearing potential who are treated with any ASM during pregnancy. This will enable early detection and timely intervention of MCMs.
Obstetricians should also recommend screening cardiac investigations of the fetus among this patient population who are treated with phenobarbital during pregnancy to enable early detection and timely intervention of congenital heart defects.
Valproic acid use in people with epilepsy of childbearing may increase the risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and lower IQ, in children born to this patient population.
Compared with intrauterine exposure to other studied ASMs (ie, carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, phenytoin, and topiramate), exposure to valproic acid is likely or possibly associated with a decrease in full scale, verbal, and non-verbal IQ.
Compared with intrauterine exposure to other studied ASMs (ie, carbamazepine, clonazepam, levetiracetam, and lamotrigine), intrauterine exposure to valproic acid is possibly associated with an increased risk for ASD.
Age-appropriate developmental screening in children exposed to any ASM in utero born to people with epilepsy of childbearing potential should be implemented by clinicians.
At least 0.4 mg of folic acid supplementation should be prescribed by clinicians daily preconceptionally and during pregnancy in people with epilepsy of childbearing potential who are receiving an ASM. The goal of folic acid supplementation is to reduce the risk for neural tube defects and possibly improve neurodevelopmental outcomes, including ASD and global IQ, in the offspring.
Although this updated practice guideline published by the AAN, AES, and SMFM addresses changes in guidance from the previously published guidelines in 2009, as well as previous knowledge gaps, future research to address remaining knowledge gaps is warranted.
One way in which studies can build on the current understanding of teratogenesis, perinatal, and neurodevelopmental outcomes after in utero exposure to ASM is by considering more novel and understudied therapies, including polytherapy.
“The risks of MCMs and adverse perinatal outcomes for newer and understudied ASMs (e.g., lacosamide, zonisamide, clobazam, and perampanel) require further research,” the researchers stated. “Future guidelines should consider even newer ASMs, such as cenobamate and fenfluramine, which were not included in our search strategy.”
To inform ASM choice among people with epilepsy, developmental screening requirements, and resource planning, longitudinal studies assessing long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with intrauterine exposure to ASMs other than valproic acid are necessary.
A bolstered understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying teratogenic effects of certain ASMs will help in the development of therapeutic strategies.
Dosing regimens can be informed by clarifying factors that impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ASM metabolism in people with epilepsy of childbearing age during pregnancy and postpartum.
Definitions for exposures and outcomes, as well as which adjustment variables to include in any multivariable analyses should be standardized.
The optimal dose of folic acid supplementation, as well as timing of supplementation with respect to conception, should be clarified.
The effects of screening for fetal anomalies and growth restriction on perinatal outcomes needs to be characterized.
Future studies should include patient populations that are socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse. Further, transgender, nonbinary, and intersex people with epilepsy of childbearing potential should be included in studies.
Overall, the researchers agreed that “When treating PWECP [people with epilepsy of childbearing potential], clinicians should recommend ASMs and doses that optimize both seizure control and fetal outcomes should pregnancy occur, at the earliest possible opportunity preconceptionally.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/antibiotic-stewardship-improves-prescribing-outpatient-setting/,Antibiotic Stewardship Improves Prescribing in Outpatient Setting: Q&A,"Antibiotic resistance has become a significant health threat in the United States, affecting humans, animals, and the environment. It is estimated that 2,868,700 infections and 35,900 deaths are attributable to antibiotic-resistant bacteria or fungi, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Antibiotic stewardship has become one of the core components to combat the threat of antibiotic-resistant infection. Antibiotic stewardship tracks antibiotic prescribing and access to improve appropriate use, reduce unnecessary use, and ensure improved access.
The Clinical Advisor spoke with Guillermo (Memo) Sanchez, PA-C, MPH, MSHS, about his work at the Office of Antibiotic Stewardship at the CDC after his presentation on Outpatient Antibiotic Prescribing: Updates From CDC and Common Myths Every PA Should Know, at the American Academy of Physician Associates (AAPA) annual meeting in Houston, TX.
PA Sanchez: There are many opportunities for improvement with antibiotic stewardship. The biggest opportunities are in the outpatient setting. That’s why we chose to emphasize outpatient settings in our session at AAPA this year.
In the outpatient setting, we know that PAs and nurse practitioners (NPs) account for at least 1 out of 3 antibiotic prescriptions. Approximately 85% of antibiotics are prescribed in outpatient settings. The most common conditions for which antibiotics are prescribed include respiratory conditions such as sinusitis, pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, and other upper respiratory tract infections.
We know that approximately 28% of antibiotics that are prescribed provide little to no benefit, such as antibiotic prescribing for viral respiratory infections.
Even among the antibiotics that are prescribed for the other 72% of encounters, we know that there are often opportunities for improvements in antibiotic selection, antibiotic duration, and other aspects of antibiotic prescribing. Macrolides, for example, are commonly prescribed in the outpatient setting for respiratory infections but are rarely recommended.
Advanced practice providers, especially NPs, represent a growing proportion of U.S. outpatient antibiotic prescribing in 2022 compared to 2011. This is in contrast to an overall trend of less antibiotic prescriptions by physicians during the same time frame. This emphasizes the importance of including PAs and NPs in antibiotic stewardship messaging and activities across the spectrum of healthcare.
PA Sanchez: The biggest cost is in terms of patient safety. For those 28% of patients for which antibiotics provide no benefit, those are situations where the antibiotic is not providing a benefit to the patient but is adding risk to their treatment. About 1 in every 1000 antibiotics that are prescribed, whether appropriate or not, result in a visit to an emergency department for an adverse drug event. Antibiotic use is the most important modifiable patient risk factor for Clostridiodes difficile infections, which caused 223,900 cases and 12,800 deaths in hospitalized patients in 2017.
Clinicians might think that antibiotics are relatively benign but there is data to show that they are consistently contributing to these emergency room visits, and those are real harms that are being caused to patients which need to be considered every time an antibiotic is prescribed.
PA Sanchez: That’s a great question and it’s going to depend on the setting, on the established relationship with the patient, and on the culture of prescribing within that practice. A lot of those things are within our control. We can control how we communicate to patients, how well we describe the benefits of antibiotics versus the risks, and how well we address the concerns of the patient. We also often are able to influence the prescribing culture of the organization in which we work.
There are communication trainings that are available to help clinicians, such as the DART method. This a wonderful 20-minute training from the University of Washington.
There is also a more comprehensive course that’s available on the CDC website, which goes over the principles of communication during these visits. There are opportunities to improve the way that we communicate during those encounters and that makes a big difference. So all of these factors can contribute to making the right choice align with the easy choice as a clinician during these encounters.
PA Sanchez: I think there is always opportunities for improvement in our practice, but what I’m excited about is for PAs to become more involved within leadership roles in this space, such as within health system-based antibiotic stewardship programs. Many PAs and NPs practice medicine in urgent care settings, emergency departments, and primary care — all across the spectrum of outpatient settings. Because of that, there will always be a role for PAs and NPs to sit at the table where decisions are being made regarding the improvement of antibiotic use. That is where our program is trying to connect with PAs, PA leaders, and leaders of health systems, to make sure that PAs are included in outpatient stewardship program activities and other activities intended for quality improvements aimed at that purpose.
PA Sanchez: At the Office of Antibiotic Stewardship we’ve been working to improve antibiotic use across the spectrum of health care for well over 15 years. Outpatient settings have always been critical to the work we do in our program. We’re always looking to measure, describe, and characterize antibiotic prescribing trends, not only among PAs, but also among NPs, physicians, and across different medical specialties. We’re looking for opportunities to improve antibiotic use, whether it’s the duration of treatment, antibiotic selection, or the many other ways that we can do what’s right for our patients.
On our website, we have resources and materials that can help PAs improve antibiotic prescribing, not only within their practice but within their organization. One example is our Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship, which is the framework to improve antibiotic prescribing. So if a reader wants to know more information, check out our website, check out those resources, stay in touch, and let us know how we can help.",Nikki Kean
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/2024-pa-student-year-adcvocates-for-underserved-communities/,2024 PA Student of the Year Advocates for Underserved Communities,"Jade O. Norman, PA-S, MHS, was named Physician Associate (PA) Student of the Year during the recent AAPA annual meeting. Norman is a second-year student at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, TN, and co-author of Beyond Beautiful: A Girl’s Guide to Studying, Self Care, and Staying Focused During Difficult Times. As the founder of The Woman Who Did, a brand and advocacy consulting agency, she collaborates with individuals and corporations to nurture “authentic leadership” and has recently launched a mentorship program for underrepresented pre-PA and PA students.
Norman: After completing my master’s in Health Sciences at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, I spent my gap year reflecting on my purpose, and I knew that it was in medicine. I also realized that [I needed to] prioritize what was important — my aging family and what I desired for my life without sacrificing my burning desire to practice medicine. That drove me to make the switch from pre-med to pre-PA and apply to Meharry’s newly announced PA program. This decision allowed me to fulfill the mission and vision that I have for my life and to have some more wiggle room to do some of the other things that were also important to me without sacrificing my purpose.
One of the most pivotal clinical experiences that shaped my passion for medicine was at Grady Hospital, a Level I trauma center in Atlanta, Georgia. I worked as a researcher and intake specialist in the psychiatric unit. I saw many patients who looked like me come into the hospital with different acute and chronic psychiatric diagnoses at some of their most vulnerable moments. I connected culturally with these people. My biggest takeaway from this experience was that no matter what the reason people are presenting to the clinic, it’s really important to remember that they are people first — before they are your patients.
Norman: Chronic health conditions and mental health care are some of the biggest health challenges communities of color face, which is why I chose to attend a Historically Black College and University. Our institution emphasizes training and equipping Black and Brown physician assistants to treat and address the disparities in marginalized and minoritized communities by committing ourselves to be lifelong learners and leaders of medical justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. Additionally, it is also important to acknowledge that some health challenges seen in these communities are the result of systemic racial oppression, and the training that I am receiving at my institution does an excellent job of destigmatizing race-based medical practice to promote health equity.
The health literacy gap and the digital health literacy gap are other challenges prevalent in minoritized communities. Communicating with patients is imperative, as I often wonder how many patients truly understand their health information. This is an underemphasized healthcare component and something we need to focus more on, especially with the abundance of technology we have. I’m excited to see how we can integrate that into clinical practice and move towards closing the health disparities gap to provide adequate care for underserved communities.
Norman: Focus on mentorship. Having a mentor or multiple mentors can take you from 0 to 100. In my opinion, this is a “cheat code” for stepping into the health care profession; mentorship can always take you one step further. Having mentors who look like you and even some who don’t will help you unlock a different level of thinking.
Norman: The biggest lesson I’ve learned so far is that my ears, mouth, and hands can do a lot of healing. We learn many things during the didactic phase, like cursory and mastering a head-to-toe physical exam, but you can do a lot without tools. Physician Assistants are known for taking a thorough patient history, and over 80% of accurate diagnoses can be gathered from an accurate history alone.  This is a powerful lesson because often in underserved communities, there may not be the “fancy” equipment and the top interventions, but a lot of healing can still be done with our hands, ears, and mouths.
Listening to patients is so important, and it’s something that will stick with me after PA school and into clinical practice. Effective communication can take the patient-provider relationship to the next level.
Norman: I always have to recenter and recalibrate myself. You can feel when burnout is approaching, you must constantly remind yourself of your “why.” Immersing myself in things that constantly remind me of why I do what I do, whether it’s volunteering at a community event, or more recently laying hands on a patient in rotations, or calling my grandmother and hearing her say, “I’m looking at the picture of you in that white coat…”
Jade O. Norman, PA-S, MHS, serves as the COO of The Madam Dreamers Academy, a membership group for underrepresented minority women in medicine and public health, Norman strives to foster connections and opportunities for development. Additionally, she works to build strategic international and national partnerships as the Director of Community Engagement at The Healthcare Plug, the nation’s first medical concierge service for low socioeconomic communities.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/generative-ai-in-health-care/,Generative AI in Health Care: How Can We Protect Health Information?,"Generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) has gradually produced changes in the health care system. The technology has redesigned clinicians’ workflow, patient interactions, and the management of patient data in a way that may prove beneficial but also raise concerns.
“We want generative artificial intelligence to fulfill the promise of the electronic health record (EHR),” said Dr Ali Soroush, assistant professor in the Divisions of Gastroenterology and Data-Driven and Digital Medicine (D3M) at the Icahn School of Medicine in New York City. “When we started with EHRs, the thought was, ‘If we have more data, we can do better.’ But now we have too much data.”
Capabilities of AI — software that learns from experience and displays capacities mimicking human cognition — have evolved especially rapidly since the 2010s. Powered by Big Data, previously established machine learning techniques1 began to show increasing potential for assisting in clinical diagnosis, disease risk or health outcome prediction, and clinical decision support.2 But this required consistently structured data to be used as inputs to an AI model, limiting AIs’ usefulness to busy clinicians.
More recently, technical advances in AI model creation allowed them to process data not intentionally structured as datasets, such as sound recordings of clinical encounter conversations, patient inquiry to a chatbot, and even video.3 The addition of large language models produced newly capable Gen-AIs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude AI. These newer tools can synthesize new data, text, images, or other outputs based on patterns of preexisting learned data.4
Such human-like creativity permits a growing number of new use cases. For example, a clinician may run a sound recording of a clinician-patient conversation through an AI integrated in an EHR, to generate a written encounter note. And whereas previous chatbots were generally restricted to a narrow menu of outputs, newer iterations may give sophisticated written answers to a patient inquiry, using a specific clinician user’s preferred writing tone.
“Humans are a finite resource,” Dr Soroush said. “Computing and AI resources are less finite. So, it will be exciting if we can use AI to let humans focus on things like communicating with patients, having difficult conversations, or doing complicated procedures. And I think people will be happier doing those things instead of digging through a confusing medical record.”
AI technology in the future may also help with systems issues in smaller practices, Dr Soroush explained.
“For example, instead of hiring a billing specialist and also a scheduler, they might hire an AI biller and scheduler for a fraction of the price,” he said. “It’s exciting that AIs might help us improve the quality of care, reduce administrative burdens, and help extricate us, as human beings, from the morass of our medical data.”
While the benefits may be transformative, the risks of Gen-AI for health care stakeholders are considerable as well. To be useful in health care settings, Gen-AIs, especially large commercial models such as ChatGPT, are trained (ie, developed) using enormous amounts of data. Inherently this includes personal data of health care consumers. These data are shared with the AI model throughout its life cycle: during initial data collection, model development (training), and model implementation phases.3,4 Because data storage and analysis require internet and cloud connectivity, risk for data security loss or privacy violations can arise at any of these phases.
The nature and extent of these vulnerabilities are still being discovered. Research groups, for example, have reported on and demonstrated nonintuitive techniques of prompting (i.e., queries or other inputs to the implemented model) that can extract training data verbatim.5 Such techniques could be used maliciously by a skilled prompter to obtain sensitive or protected information.
This prospect gives fresh urgency to questions such as what uses of patient data should be permissible, who should own the data, and how secure the data are against violations of privacy, including those covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Already Italian regulators have warned OpenAI that ChatGPT violated the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which covers data privacy.6
These privacy concerns are interrelated with cybersecurity concerns, especially as datasets for health technology get ever larger. The massive size of these datasets makes them attractive cyberattack targets, posing a fresh challenge to HIPAA compliance.
Data breaches of US health care organizations continue to rise, year over year. In 2023, according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Civil Rights (OCR), 725 reported security breaches involved more than 133 million patient records.7 These numbers are an underreport, as the OCR publishes only breaches of at least 500 or more records. Ransomware and hacking constitute 80% of these incidents, despite improvements in data encryption technology and practices. For some, events such as the highly disruptive hacking attack on Change Healthcare8 are a forbidding backdrop for health care innovations that rely on AI model-sized datasets.
“It’s both an exciting time and a scary time, with the advances in AI that have come and are coming,” Dr Soroush said. “It could lead in different directions. There’s a potential for great harm. But there’s also potential for great improvement and good to the practice of medicine.”
Dr Soroush emphasized the importance of proper implementation of AI in health care.
“We don’t want to do it the way Facebook deployed social media — moving fast and breaking things,” he said. “In fact, in medicine, we tend to do the opposite: move very slowly, test extensively, and then deploy. But we have to figure out how to do that while not being 15 or 20 years behind on the technology.”
Dr Soroush also explained the need to address patients’ concerns regarding AI, which have been reported in surveys.9,10 “They don’t want a robot making decisions,” he said. “They don’t want an impersonal experience. They don’t want their data to be sold to a company, because they value privacy. They don’t want information going to their insurance companies that will raise their rates.”
It is possible to improve the patient experience and alleviate patient concerns with “proper guardrails around these issues,” Dr Soroush mentioned, highlighting the value of prioritizing the patient-provider relationship along the development process of AI tools.
Efforts are ongoing both to bolster health data protection and to earn public trust of health care systems using Gen-AIs. These efforts depend in part on regulatory frameworks for data protection, such as HIPAA and the GDPR. In turn, those regulations help inform how health technology companies will design secure infrastructure for systems and platforms to run Gen-AIs.
Technical solutions to protect sensitive information used by Gen-AIs continue to evolve. Some solutions address the design and features of the models themselves. Algorithms, or operating rules, may restrict the flow of actual patient data during model training, instead releasing only numerical information needed to update the model’s accuracy.4 Such algorithms likely will be paired with blockchain technology, which forms an added security layer by maintaining a decentralized “ledger” to log and authorize access and changes to a database.11 In other strategies, only synthetic or proxy data, with characteristics matching real patients’ data, are fed to the model.
Some health care systems opt to partner with technology companies to use smaller, open-source models. Those immediately responsible for the model can view its code, or program instructions, unlike the “black-box” AIs shipped by companies such as OpenAI and Microsoft. This can offer tighter data protection, as the data can be secured within the health system that uses the AI. Tradeoffs include that such models, compared to commercial Gen-AIs such as ChatGPT, may be less stable (i.e., crash more often) and accept smaller amounts of text-based inputs.12
Each effort to secure data brings new challenges. Sophisticated learning algorithms and blockchain require considerable computer network resources. Stolen synthetic data could be used to generate fraudulent insurance claims, or fed back into the “true” dataset, compromising the accuracy of patients’ data. Health system and clinician leaders will need to rely on health technology partners’ expertise to navigate these choices and threats.
“The devil is in the details with some of these business agreements,” Dr Soroush said, adding:
“They may have a new or experimental model to deploy, and they might offer you a really good deal for it. But what data are you giving them in return? They can likely use those data in their models for training, and monetize and use them for other purposes. So, if your health care system is sharing data, not only should the data be protected, but the institution should capture the value it can create. It should benefit patients and also the institution that put all the hard work into collecting the data. Because an institution with those resources can then go on to improve other elements of patient care delivery.”
“That process,” he said, “takes a good lawyer.”
Dr Soroush also feels clinician end-users should develop general AI literacy. “If you’re a physician, you have training on how to prescribe medication,” he said. “You understand pharmacology and drug labeling, and know roughly what results to expect. I think we’ll need to have similar competencies with AI-driven tools: understanding what the model is meant to do, where its potential failure points lie — what are its potential ‘complications’? What are the potential side effects of me using this model?”
There is plenty of room for cautious optimism, in Dr. Soroush’s opinion, that medicine will integrate Gen-AI according to shared values. Stakeholder groups13,14 at both governmental and nongovernmental levels can collaborate to shape this integration.
“I think health care is probably the place where we’re going to do this best, compared to other industries,” he said. “This is because we have built-in systems, like HIPAA, to protect privacy. [And] having interconnected stakeholder groups, at different levels of health care, makes me hopeful that AI integration is going to go better than prior waves of health tech.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/pregnant-women-with-sud/,2024 PA of the Year Focuses on Pregnant and Postpartum Individuals With SUD,"Jasmin Charles, MPAS, PA-C, is the co-founder and clinical director of the Substance Use & Pregnancy – Recovery, Addiction, Dependence (SUPeRAD) Clinic in the Department of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at the University of Utah. SUPeRAD is a multi-disciplinary, trans-disciplinary integrated clinic specializing in perinatal addiction. In this role, Charles is a clinician, trainer, researcher, advocate, and community partner. Since Charles helped to found SUPeRAD in 2017, the clinic has served over 1300 pregnant and postpartum individuals.
From my early childhood, I was raised with the values and morals of ensuring that everyone had an opportunity for a positive quality of life. Through high school I volunteered with the Girl Scouts and ran a Girl Scout Troop for homeless young girls. I went to college to save the world as fast as I could. Although I always thought I would go into medicine, it seemed like a longer road to save the world, so I got my degree in Non-Profit Management and started as a community domestic violence advocate taking care of women, primarily migrant farm workers in rural Washington.
From there, I was the program and operational director for a Boys and Girls Club in the inner city that was housed in the largest housing development west of the Mississippi, where I worked with children ranging in age from 4 to 18. Through that experience, I witnessed first-hand health disparities related to poor access to health and dental care.
Through my experience working with community clinics, which were primarily staffed by PAs. When I was looking at my medical options, I felt like the PA route was much better suited for me than going to medical school. The boots on the ground, team based care model with a focus on underserved populations fit with who I am.
I am lucky to have been born and raised in Utah, where my parents still live. I knew the PA program at the University of Utah was driven by the values of taking care of underprivileged and underserved individuals.
I started my PA journey with the Community Health Centers Inc. Working with mostly Spanish-speaking individuals, many of whom were undocumented or immigrants to the United States. In that community, there was a small pool of individuals with substance use disorders (SUD) and I worked alongside the physician who had a DEA waiver to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder.
As an advanced practice clinician in the department, you take the phone calls for all of the physicians on any given day and I noticed these refills [for buprenorphine] coming through from these individuals who were struggling with substance use disorder and I reached out to the physician and asked if there was a plan or a clinic in place to help and support these individuals.
Studies have shown these patients do better with a small community due to commonalities of historical trauma and stigma in the medical system from their chronic illnesses. Marcela Smid, MD, MS, MA, was the clinician with a DEA waiver to prescribe buprenorphine, so we sat down and got this hare-brained idea that there was this beautiful population of individuals who were stigmatized by deep-rooted bias who did not have adequate access to obstetric care. And from there we birthed SUPeRAD
If you were an advanced practice clinician in 2016, you needed the same 8 hours of training (4 hours live and 4 hours online) as a physician plus an additional 16 hours for a total of 24 hours of specialized training in pharmacotherapy directly related to opioid use disorder to prescribe buprenorphine. The DEA waiver came with your DEA number, which had a separate set of letters to demonstrate that you could prescribe. In the last 2 years, things have shifted and as of June 2023, you no longer need a DEA waiver to prescribe buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder. A licensed clinician can prescribe it using their DEA number, the same as they can prescribe any other controlled substance.
If I look at all of the aspects of things that I do within my job they all come back to direct patient care, whether that is directly providing patient care or mentoring and teaching others to provide unbiased non-stigmatized open access to care.
The research aspect of my work was something I never thought I would do but it has been so rewarding. I had one patient I was enrolling in a trial who asked me a clarifying question: “I could be a part of something that, although it may not help me right now, may help someone else in the future who’s been in my shoes?” And I said I hoped that it would help right now, but yes. “I’ve never been allowed to make an impact, and yes, I want to enroll.”
That’s why I feel like no matter what I’m doing day in and day out, it all comes back to making an impact on one person. And that’s what I love about my job.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/transgender-health-and-surgery/,"Lauren Eisenbeis, DMSc, MS, PA-C, Discusses Transgender Health and Surgery: Q&A","In 1979, the World Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) published its first Standard of Care (SOC). WPATH is an international, multidisciplinary association whose mission is to “promote evidence-based care, education, research, public policy, and respect in transgender health.”  Version 8 of the SOC was published in September 2023 (SOC-8).
The Clinical Advisor spoke with Lauren Eisenbeis, DMSc, MS, PA-C, about what barriers exist for transgender and nonbinary individuals seeking medical and surgical care. She is the lead advanced practice provider for Luminis Health Plastic Surgery in Annapolis, Maryland, and is a plastic surgery PA specializing in transgender care. She recently presented a session on “Transgender Health: How to Provide Culturally Competent Care to Patients Undergoing Gender Affirming Surgery” at the American Academy of Physician Associates annual meeting in Houston, TX.
PA Eisenbeis: Just like other marginalized patient populations, we are all responsible for caring for transgender, gender diverse, and those in the LBGTQI+ community by providing culturally competent care regardless of our personal beliefs or opinions. This includes using the patient’s preferred pronouns.
Patients will seek care wherever they live in the United States when there is a medical emergency. Therefore, education on the physical and emotional needs of this patient population, procedures patients may be going through, or their post-operative care needs to be better incorporated into our physician, PA, NP, and nursing education.
In regard to providing surgical procedures and medical treatment, the ability to offer these services is going to be dependent on institutional goals, as well as provider comfortability in actually providing that medical treatment. This is a newer area of medical training and it’s something that providers are becoming more comfortable with as they have more access to education and training. I think and hope access to care will continue to increase.
PA Eisenbeis: It is dependent on institutional goals. Some institutions don’t have the resources or the desire to provide care for this community. This does not mean they are restricting care, but may not have added the resources for that care. Patients and providers are going to stay within areas where they’re comfortable. There is an ability to provide gender-affirming care as long as you have support around you.
PA Eisenbeis: Providing care to minors is a more controversial topic. Again, minors will be present in any health care facility or coming through the emergency department, primary care, and pediatric offices so a general understanding of patient’s needs is required for all healthcare professionals.
Research cited in the SOC-8 has found that gender-affirming care for transgender adolescents improves overall health and well-being including building self-esteem and improving overall quality of life. Conversely, risks for not providing gender-affirming care for these adolescents can yield negative mental health outcomes “including increased substance use and increased rates of suicidality,” noted the SOC-8.
The SOC-8 removed the minimum age for providing gender-affirming medical care; these changes to the SOC-8 reflect the fact that “one-size-fits-all health care models, especially transgender care, are not accurate or appropriate for every person.”
For pediatric patients, there is well-documented evidence of practitioners being supportive of patients with their gender expression, which can include their preferred names, how they dress, or how they style their hair. The medical community encourages pediatric transgender patients to engage with a mental health provider to help patients better understand these feelings, especially in the developing brain.
The SOC-8 guidelines recommend that patients reach “the age of adulthood, which may vary based on where that person lives or is seeking care,” to be a candidate for gender-affirming surgery. These guidelines are designed to help providers make “individualized assessments about when and for whom a procedure is age-appropriate and medically necessary and exist to ensure that patients receive the individualized care they need, as is true across medicine”
PA Eisenbeis: The most common surgeries are top surgeries. For our trans-females that includes a breast augmentation. For trans-males or non-binary folks, who have body dysphoria over breast tissue, they undergo a gender-affirming mastectomy, which is to remove breast tissue to help create a flat appearing chest.
PA Eisenbeis: We don’t have enough longitudinal data looking at the risks or benefits of hormone or surgical therapies and diagnosing breast cancer. This is mostly due to the limited number of patients willing to participate in research studies. Now, as awareness of this topic increases, there are a number to studies that are looking at the long-term data and outcomes of these interventions. Current recommendations are that after a gender-affirming mastectomy or removal of the breast tissue, the patient does not need to undergo yearly chest exams by a health care provider unless a patient experiences a new lump, bump, or discharge. If one of these complaints arises, then the patient is recommended to undergo a breast cancer workup.
For trans-females who’ve had a breast augmentation or have development of breast tissue, it is recommended that formal breast imaging with mammography is done every other year beginning at the age of 50, plus 5 to 10 years of hormone therapy.
It is the health care provider’s responsibility to educate transgender patients about the signs and symptoms of breast cancer, including learning how to perform a self-breast or self-chest exam. Patients may have a lot going on in their lives, but screening is important. If a patient is feeling a new lump, bump, nipple discharge, change in the shape of their breasts, or has a strong family history of breast cancer, those cases require further investigation.
Interestingly and importantly, there is a lot of collaboration between oncologic breast surgeons and plastic surgeons for trans-males who may have a strong family history of breast cancer or a known BRCA mutation. In those cases, if patients are seeking top surgery, a more formal mastectomy is performed by the oncologic surgeon in conjunction with the plastic surgeon who helps to create a more masculine-appearing incision. It is exciting to see this collaboration between different fields of medicine to improve patient’s access to care.
PA Eisenbeis: Historically, there has been this level of mistrust because some providers don’t necessarily know how to care for this patient population. In addition, insurance companies have not recognized these procedures as medically necessary and thus, do not cover them.
Regarding provider education, there are more academic institutes that are offering transgender surgical procedures. There are new surgical fellowships specific to transgender care. Medical, PA, and NP schools are changing curriculums and providing classes on gender diversity. I believe patients are starting to recognize these changes and see that their provider knows how to address them with their proper pronouns and recognize what procedures they’ve had.
Most major insurance companies do offer gender-affirming medical and surgical care, which is a huge change from even a few years ago when there was little to no insurance coverage of gender-affirming care. While major insurance companies typically cover surgery, there are also going to be private corporations that have historic anti-trans beliefs and are going to place exclusions within their insurance policy. It is going to be hard to change certain companies, but the big players in the insurance world are making a lot of headway and getting these procedures covered. I think in the next 10 years, we’re going to see a lot of continued positive change.",Nikki Kean
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/clinical-update-on-drowning/,Clinical Update on Drowning,"Drowning is a significant worldwide public health concern. In 2019, approximately 236,000 people died from drowning, making it the world’s third leading cause of accidental death, accounting for 7% of all injury-related deaths globally.1 In the United States, there were an average of 3536 drowning deaths annually from 2005 to 2014 (about 10 deaths per day),2 and an additional 332 drowning deaths per year in boating-related accidents.3
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), worldwide there are about 42 drowning deaths every hour.4 Drowning is a major cause of disability and death, particularly in children. Globally, over half of all drowning victims are younger than 25 years of age.4
In 2002, the WHO provided a simple, comprehensive, internationally accepted definition of drowning: “the process of experiencing respiratory impairment due to submersion or immersion in liquid;” and classified outcomes as death, morbidity, or no morbidity.5 It was recommended that unclear terminology such as wet, dry, active, passive, silent, and secondary drowning should no longer be used. Alcohol and/or illicit drug use is an important risk factor, as more than 50% of adult drowning deaths are believed to be alcohol-related.2,3 With adequate supervision, swimming instruction, and public education measures, it is estimated that 85% of drownings could be prevented.2,6
Drowning is quick and silent, which is contrary to the popular understanding. Most victims of drowning go unnoticed and are found after being submerged for an unknown period. Victims who drown in open water or pools often don’t appear to be in distress. They are unable to keep their mouth above water long enough to breathe properly and cannot call for help. The instinctive drowning response, an involuntary autonomic reaction, explains the absence of these behaviors, as breathing instinctively takes priority.7 This response causes the victim to maintain an upright position, often with their head tilted back and arms flapping or paddling at their sides, pressing down into the water in an effort to raise their mouth above water. Their arm movements and focus on lifting their mouth out of the water impede their ability to wave, kick their feet, or grasp a rope. The lack of leg movement, upright position, and inability to keep the mouth consistently above water are evidence of imminent drowning. A person who can shout and keep their mouth constantly above water may be in distress but is not necessarily in immediate danger of drowning.
There is evidence for a high prevalence of fatal and nonfatal drownings of untrained persons attempting to perform in-water rescues.6 Individuals without formal water rescue training should avoid entering the water and should protect themselves by attempting a rescue by reaching out to the drowning victim with a long object, throwing a floating object or rowing to the victim in a water vessel. The priority is to interrupt the drowning process by providing flotation as an interim measure to reduce the risk of airway submersion.8 Trained water rescuers should practice according to their training level and availability of equipment.6
In-water resuscitation is difficult and should only be attempted by trained rescuers who can assess for a pulse and deliver rescue breaths in the water when an unconscious victim cannot be removed from the water quickly and safely.9 In-water resuscitation consists of ventilation alone, as chest compressions are not effective in water.5 Those who do not respond after several rescue breaths should be presumed to be in cardiac arrest and should be brought to land expediently to initiate full cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).8 Cervical spine immobilization is only necessary when head or neck injury is strongly suspected or witnessed (ie, diving, boating, or another type of accident).
Once on land, the patient should be placed supine, keeping the trunk and head at the same level. If the patient is breathing but unconscious, they should be placed in the left lateral decubitus recovery position.8 An individual who is not breathing but has a pulse should continue to receive rescue breaths. Airway and breathing are prioritized because the primary cause of cardiac arrest in drowning victims is usually asphyxia and hypoxia. For this reason, CPR should follow the traditional airway-breathing-circulation (ABC) sequence, rather than the circulation-airway-breathing (CAB) sequence.2,5 In the case of a pulseless, unconscious victim, CPR should be started immediately with 5 rescue breaths followed by 30 chest compressions and continued with 2 rescue breaths and 30 compressions per cycle. Initiate CPR in persons who have been submerged for less than 1 hour and who do not have obvious physical evidence of death (ie, rigor mortis). Basic life support should continue until the return of respiration and pulse, rescuer exhaustion or until advanced life support is available.10
Studies show that vomiting occurs in 65% of victims receiving rescue breaths alone vs 85% of victims receiving CPR.5 This is the most frequent complication during a resuscitation attempt and leads to a higher risk of aspiration and asphyxia.5 The Heimlich maneuver, abdominal thrusts and positioning with head down, are not recommended when water remains the cause of airway obstruction, as it increases the risk of vomiting and aspiration and leads to a delay in necessary resuscitation.8  A finger-sweep maneuver is indicated for debris visible in the oropharynx (ie, sand, pebbles, seaweed).10,11 Once advanced medical care is available, gastric decompression should be considered to avoid vomiting and aspiration.10
Hypothermia is common in drowning victims even when rescued from warm water. Reversal of hypothermia by active and passive methods should be initiated as soon as possible. Mild hypothermia (body temperature > 34°C) can be treated passively by removing wet clothing and utilizing blankets. Moderate hypothermia (30°C to 34°C) should be treated with active external rewarming via heating blankets, forced hot air, hot packs, or radiant heat.4 Individuals with severe hypothermia (< 30°C) require active internal rewarming with warmed humidified oxygen, warmed intravenous (IV) fluids, or peritoneal, thoracic, or gastric lavage. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be helpful in patients with profound hypothermia.7
Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) delivered early after water rescue improves overall patient morbidity and mortality.8 The most common presenting rhythm in drowning victims is asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA).5 Therefore, manual resuscitation should not be delayed when applying an automatic external defibrillator (AED).8 Studies show that it is safe and effective to use an AED in a wet environment.6 Focus should be placed on firm attachment of the pads.
In the field, peripheral venous access is the preferred method of delivery of ACLS medications. It is not recommended to administer endotracheal medication to drowning victims.8 Early intubation is indicated in patients who are not breathing, have a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of less than 8, or do not respond to basic life support.2,5 Once intubated, most victims can be oxygenated and ventilated effectively even when pulmonary edema fluid fills the tube. Aspirate and suction the tube only when fluids make effective ventilation impossible, so as not to disturb oxygenation.8 A series of intravenous (IV) doses of norepinephrine or epinephrine can be considered in drowning resuscitation.5
Advanced cardiac life support may be terminated after 30 minutes of resuscitation without return of vital signs in patients without hypothermia.10 Hypothermic patients should have continued resuscitation until they have been rewarmed and maintained at normal core body temperature for at least 20 minutes.5 Many ACLS interventions such as pacing, atropine, lidocaine, and defibrillation are not effective in hypothermic patients. Antiarrhythmic agents should be avoided when core body temperature is less than 30°C.10 If a victim has been submerged for longer than 1 hour, the rescuers should transition their goal from resuscitation to body recovery.10
A drowning classification system, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2012, helps clinicians assess risk, likelihood of survival, and direct appropriate interventions. There are 6 grades of drowning, with higher numbers representing more severe injury (Table).5
Table. Drowning Classification System5
The Revised Utstein Drowning Data Form is a standardized method of data collection and reporting that includes information on circumstances leading to drowning, time of immersion, length and degree of resuscitation at the scene, and pre-existing medical conditions.12 Other considerations include the environmental conditions, intoxication; type of submersion; type and temperature of water and air; scuba depth and duration; and any associated trauma.7
Grade 0 and 1 drowning patients can be released from the scene or emergency department (ED) after 10 to 15 minutes of careful observation if there are no complaints, associated illnesses, or coughing, and the patient is fully conscious, with normal breathing, circulation, skin color, and perfusion.8 Patients who are released should be warned of the risk of delayed lung complications and instructed to seek medical help immediately if respiratory symptoms develop.
Drowning victims who require resuscitation (grade 2 and higher), including rescue breathing alone, should be transported to the hospital for evaluation.10 Those with grade 2 classification usually only require oxygen by nasal cannula, observation for 6 to 8 hours, and discharge when weaned off oxygen, assuming normal mentation and respiratory function and no evidence of deterioration over time.6 Bronchospasm is often seen in nonfatal drowning victims and management is treated similarly to acute asthma exacerbation; most cases rapidly improve with inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists.3 As needed, the clinician will secure the airway and ensure adequate oxygenation to maintain arterial saturation (≥ 95%), warm the patient, stabilize circulation, clear the cervical spine, and place a gastric tube for decompression.9
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may occur immediately or after delay, even after a normal chest radiograph, necessitating observation for 4 to 6 hours.10 Patients with grade 3 to 6 severity should be admitted to the intensive care unit for close observation.5 Criteria for admission include severe cough, abnormal lung sounds, frothy sputum, hypotension, and altered mental status.9
Few diagnostic tests are necessary for drowning victims who are alert, oriented, and without respiratory symptoms. Evaluation should be guided by a comprehensive history, physical examination, and clinical judgment.7 Patients who are or were hypothermic or hypoxic should have baseline electrolytes, renal function, and hematologic labs.7 An arterial blood gas (ABG) may be necessary in patients who are hypoxic or in respiratory distress to guide interventions.6 Metabolic acidosis occurs in 70% of patients arriving at the hospital after a drowning episode, which is usually corrected upon establishment of spontaneous breathing.5,8 Routine use of sodium bicarbonate is not recommended.5 Further intervention is necessary if the pH is lower than 7.2 or if the bicarbonate is  lower than 12 mEq/L despite adequate ventilatory support.8 Patients with persistent respiratory symptoms will have a chest radiograph. Chest radiograph findings do not correlate with ABG measurements or outcomes and cannot be used for determining prognosis if obtained at initial presentation, but may be used to track changes in patient condition.6 Individuals with suspected trauma to the head or neck should have computerized tomography (CT) imaging. If a patient remains unresponsive without a known cause or if the drowning was unwitnessed, a toxicologic screening and head/neck CT should be considered.5
Aspiration of hypertonic or hypotonic liquids washes out the pulmonary surfactant, impairs diffusion across the alveolocapillary barrier, and may cause atelectasis, ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, systemic hypoxemia, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and ARDS.13 Pulmonary insufficiency can develop rapidly or insidiously, taking up to 6 hours.10 Early use of intubation, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the awake, cooperative, and less hypoxic individual is warranted if hypoxia or dyspnea persists despite administration of 100% oxygen.11 The current ventilation treatment guidelines for patients who have been rescued from drowning follow standard management for ARDS. Once the ventilation setting has been established it should be maintained for at least 48 hours, as early weaning can lead to relapsed pulmonary edema and overall increased morbidity.5 Surfactant washout takes 2 to 4 days to regenerate; this timing is important for weaning from the ventilator.10 Since pulmonary dysfunction due to drowning is caused by a temporary and local injury, patients tend to recover faster and have fewer complications than those with ARDS.5 Corticosteroids should not be routinely administered specifically for the treatment of drowning patients.6
Pneumonia is often misdiagnosed during early care of drowning victims, as water in the lungs mimics the appearance of pneumonia on chest radiograph.8 The risk for pneumonia increases during prolonged mechanical ventilation and can be detected by the third or fourth hospital day when pulmonary edema resolves.5 Because pneumonia is usually caused by nosocomial etiologies, empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated and treatment should be adjusted once the culture and sensitivity is available.5
Severe drowning can cause cardiac dysfunction and decreased cardiac output. Early cardiac dysfunction can occur in patients with grade 4 to 6 drownings.5 Hypotension generally responds to ideal oxygenation, crystalloid infusion, and warming. If cardiac dysfunction continues after conservative therapy, echocardiography can inform decisions about the use of ionotropic agents and/or vasopressors.5
Most late deaths and long-term sequelae of drowning are neurologic in origin. Of drowning cases graded 1 to 5, 95% have no neurological sequelae.8 The neurologic outcome is determined by the neurologic state of the patient upon presentation and the duration and severity of the initial hypoxic-ischemic insult. Later, cerebral edema may develop, further compromising tissue perfusion and brain function.12 Individuals who are neurologically impaired after return of spontaneous circulation should be further assessed to ensure correct blood glucose levels, partial pressure of oxygen, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Research recommends neuroprotective therapeutic hypothermia with maintained core body temperature between 32°C and 34°C for 12 to 24 hours.5,8,10
Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) may occur after resuscitation. Sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are possible complications during the first 72 hours after resuscitation.5 Renal failure rarely can occur after submersion and is usually due to acute tubular necrosis resulting from hypoxemia, shock, hemoglobinuria, or myoglobinuria.5
Evidence about survival and outcomes following a submersion injury is limited. The following factors at presentation have been associated with a poor prognosis7,9,14: duration of submersion longer than 5 minutes, resuscitation delayed for more than 10 minutes after rescue, resuscitation duration greater than 25 minutes, age less than 3 years or more than 14 years,3,14 a GCS less than 5 or comatose on ED arrival,3,11 persistent apnea and requirement of CPR in the ED,3,11 arterial pH less than or equal to 7.10, and signs of brain-stem injury (ie, fixed and dilated pupils).5,11 According to the literature,  35% to 60% of individuals needing continued CPR on arrival to the ED die, and 60% to 100% of survivors in this group experience long-term neurologic sequelae.11 Duration of submersion is a critical factor and has an exponential relationship with the risk of death or severe neurologic impairment5,10:
Hypoxia remains the main predictor of poor outcome.9
Drowning is preventable. One of the best tools we have as clinicians to combat drowning is educating patients, parents, and our communities on the recommendations from leading health organizations. Secure, 4-sided fencing of swimming pools can exclude virtually all children younger than age 4 and potentially decrease swimming pool drowning by 80%.3 Residential pool safety measures are provided by the American Academic of Family Physicians (AAFP). Pools and hot tubs can be made safer with appropriately fitted and maintained covers and alarms. Floating soft covers obscure submerged children. Toys and other objects attractive to children should not be left in the pool area.11
The importance of adequate adult supervision, swimming with a partner, avoidance of alcohol and illicit drugs while swimming or boating, and the appropriate use of personal flotation devices should be stressed by clinicians. Up to 84% of drownings occur because of inadequate adult supervision.8 Children, especially toddlers, should be supervised at all times when they are around water. They can drown in less than 2 inches of water in a sink, bathtub, toilet, fountain, inflatable pool, bucket, or small body of standing water. Buckets, inflatable pools, and objects collecting natural standing water should be emptied.
Children with seizure disorders should have direct supervision of swimming or bathing; showering is preferable to a bath when supervision is not possible. Avoid inflatable swimming aids. Air or foam-filled swimming tools, such as water wings, inner tubes, and noodles, are not substitutes for Coast Guard–approved personal flotation devices (PFDs).11 In 2013, according to US Coast Guard data, drowning was the cause of death in more than 75% of fatal boating accidents; 85% of these fatalities were in people not wearing life jackets.6
Teach school-age children basic swimming and water safety survival skills. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends swim lessons for children over 4 years of age and provides guidelines for the prevention of drowning in infants, children, and adolescents. A 2009 case-controlled study concluded that participation in formal swimming lessons was associated with an 80% reduction in the risk of drowning.11","Danielle Kruger, PA-C, MS Ed; Alyssa Quinlan, PA-C, MS, DFAAPA; Nadine Yamout, PA-C; Gabrielle Tricorico, PA-S"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/preventing-vitamin-d-toxicity/,Preventing Vitamin D Toxicity,"Vitamin D is one of 4 fat-soluble vitamins that contribute to the essential nutrients that make life possible. It acts primarily as a sterol hormone regulating calcium and phosphorous homeostasis for bone metabolism and is increasingly recognized for its role in immunocompetency.1,2 Vitamin D stores are derived from both exogenous and endogenous sources and exist in 2 primary forms: ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Exogenous dietary forms come from fatty fish (eg, mackerel, salmon, and tuna), egg yolks, milk products (cheese, yogurt, and other foods derived from cow’s milk), mushrooms, and fortified foods like cereals, orange juice, and milk alternatives (including some brands of almond, soy, or oat milk).3,4 Dietary vitamin D requires chylomicrons for initial gastrointestinal transport to the lymph and eventually to blood circulation.1,4 The main source of vitamin D is light exposure.5 When 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin is exposed to artificial or naturally occurring light, endogenous cholecalciferol is formed.5,6 An overview of the activation and interaction of vitamin D is shown in the Figure.5,7,8
Figure. Vitamin D Pathway5,7,8
Previtamin D is obtained through either dietary intake or by synthesis in the skin upon exposure to light, where enzymes are activated. Once previtamin D reaches the liver, various hormonal signals and biochemical feedback mechanisms work together to regulate the levels of calcium in the bloodstream.
There has been an outpouring of recent research efforts seeking the association of vitamin D deficiency and chronic diseases such as diabetes, both type I 9 and type II10, obesity,11 and heart failure.12 Research crosses the lifespan and many physiologic stages, including childhood13 and pregnancy.14 Recent studies have also considered whether vitamin D deficiency could influence outcomes of COVID-19 infection.15-18 While vitamin D deficiency classically presents as rickets with rachitic rosary in children, concerns for a “subclinical” spectrum of deficiency abound despite the absence of current recommendations for routine screening in asymptomatic adults.19 It has been suggested that deficiency is protective against toxicity following accidental ingestions of supraphysiologic doses.20 While vitamin D supplementation has been promoted as safe and cost-effective, with a broad therapeutic range, it is helpful to question the dominance of casual supplementation and arbitrary replenishment practices.
While some subspecialty population such as patients with cystic fibrosis,21 have defined protocols for the treatment of deficiency, the average primary care patient may not receive a consistent standard of care, as there are no specific guidelines indicating the appropriate form of vitamin D or duration of repletion. This opens the door for possible excess of vitamin D because of ignorance of supplementation dosing, manufacturing inconsistency, and clinician bias.6,22 In a review of the literature, the most common cause of vitamin D overdose was found to be related to errors in formulation and fortification.6 Taylor and Davies6 found errors in formulation dating from 1945 to 2017, demonstrating ongoing concerns regarding the oversight of vitamin D regulation. Although vitamin D supplements are used to treat a medically defined deficiency, supplements are not held to the same standards as medications. Defined as a dietary supplement, vitamin D is regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994. This act limits oversight, allowing US Food and Drug Administration intervention only in the event of adverse outcomes related to supplement use. Effectively, this ex-post-facto regulation contributes to the manufacturing practices responsible for incidences of vitamin D toxicity.
Vitamin D toxicity is also known as hypervitaminosis D and vitamin D intoxication. The most common symptoms of vitamin D toxicity are gastrointestinal symptoms, including constipation, nausea, and vomiting.23 Symptoms are overwhelmingly nonspecific and can also include lethargy, headaches, abdominal pain, polydipsia, anorexia and poor appetite, altered mental status, pancreatitis, hypertension, and poor growth in children.2,23-29 Additional symptoms are more likely to be secondary to hypercalcemia.2,24-27 Renal findings, including hypercalciuria, may also be present.2 Long-term complications of vitamin D toxicity include ectopic calcifications of the skin, vasculature, and viscera.25,30 Those who are symptomatic are more likely to have laboratory derangements in both 25(OH)D and serum calcium; however, 25(OH)D levels may still be elevated in asymptomatic patients.31
Classically, patients will present with hypercalcemia and compensatory decreased parathyroid hormone (PTH), while phosphorous may or may not be within normal ranges.24,27,32 It has been suggested that increases in serum calcium levels despite lower PTH may be a laboratory warning sign of impending toxicity.33
The clinician should ensure a careful history to identify all sources of ingested vitamin D to understand and decrease total daily intake. This can include multivitamins, single-source supplements, and medical foods such as tube feedings and sole-source nutrition products.  Clinically significant excessive intake due to light exposure or food sources is unlikely, but supplemental forms could cause toxicity. In an acute care setting, management will depend on the severity of hypercalcemia, with milder cases treated with hydration alone, and more severe cases requiring more aggressive treatment.30 Loop diuretics given with normal saline may be administered to promote renal wasting and forced diuresis.23,24,30 Bisphosphonates, denosumab, and calcitonin may be employed to prevent further bone breakdown and subsequent spilling of calcium into the serum.24,26,28,30,34 The use of calcitonin is limited to the initial 24-hour period after presentation, as its efficacy in reducing serum calcium diminishes.30 Glucocorticoid steroids may be used to interfere with vitamin D metabolism.26,30 Given the burden of consequence of hypercalcemia, dialysis may be needed in patients refractory to intervention or presenting with renal failure.30 Additional interventions include calcium-restricted diet education, adequate hydration, and management of comorbidities. 2,26,30,35
Although the prevalence of toxicity is unknown,36 by increasing awareness of toxicity, clinicians can work to actively decrease the risk of harm. There are a few simple steps clinicians can take to lessen the risk and sequelae of toxicity.
Ensure appropriate laboratory studies and adequate follow-up. Serum 25(OH)D is the blood test for diagnosing vitamin D derangements. Levels less than 30 ng/mL are considered insufficient, while less than 20 ng/mL are deficient. Serum 25(OH)D greater than 100 ng/mL is generally accepted as the threshold for vitamin D excess. The recommended daily allowance for most generally healthy adult individuals is 600 IU (15 mcg) and the tolerable upper limit has been set at 4000 IU (100 mcg) by the Institute of Medicine.37 Recheck 25(OH)D levels no sooner than 8 weeks after intervention, and discontinue when supplementation is no longer indicated.
According to the DSHEA of 1994, dietary supplements do not require rigorous testing before entering the market, and products are only investigated by the FDA in the event of adverse outcomes. Therefore, clinicians should recommend supplements that have undergone additional third-party testing to ensure the presence of the desired component, safe levels of the desired component that match the amount listed on the label, and that the supplement is free from contaminants. The only testing agency with labeling privileges in the United States is the US Pharmacopeia (USP). Instruct patients to select specific vitamin D supplements and educate them on the appearance of the USP logo. While clinicians cannot be wholly responsible for the products on the market, USP-verified supplements are a step clinicians can take to reign in factors that can contribute to toxicity.
Reprinted with permission from the US Pharmacopeia.
Clinicians should keep vitamin D toxicity on the differential diagnosis list in the setting of hypercalcemia, including hypercalcemia not responsive to fluids and other interventions.24 Prognosis is largely dependent on the sequelae of hypercalcemia but is reassuring in most cases. Nevertheless, there has been at least 1 case report of death due to vitamin D toxicity. 38
As more specific supplementation dosing is integrated into clinical practice, be prepared to incorporate evidence-based practices. While more research is needed to determine appropriate repletion protocols for the average primary care patient, it is imperative to avoid prescribing vitamin D for fatigue and vague aches in these patients. Clinicians should follow established repletion protocols that are evidence-based when appropriate. Above all else, clinicians must lay to rest the idea that excessive vitamin intake is without consequence.","Jenissa Cortés, MS, RD, PA-C; Alicia Elam, PharmD"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/mechanism-of-action-glp-1-agonist/,"How Do GLP-1 Receptor Agonists, Like Ozempic or Mounjaro, Work?","Our easy-to-read fact sheets provide clinicians with reliable information to share with patients and their caregivers.
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone released when food is eaten to slow gastric emptying, the process by which food leaves the stomach, so that the body can absorb nutrients from food. It also increases insulin release from the pancreas and controls the feeling of satiety after eating.1
Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates the amount of glucose in the blood. When food is eaten, blood sugar increases, thus signaling the incretin system to release insulin. In some conditions, such as obesity and diabetes, the body does not respond to nutrients properly, which leads to the incretin system not functioning correctly and an increase in blood sugar.2
GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic the body’s production of GLP-1 and are approved to treat patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes.1
GLP-1 receptor agonists approved for use among patients with type 2 diabetes include dulaglutide (Trulicity®), exenatide (Bydureon BCise®, Byetta®), liraglutide (Victoza®), insulin glargine/lixisenatide (Soliqua 100/33®), semaglutide (Ozempic®, Rybelsus®), and most recently, tirzepatide (Mounjaro®).
GLP-1 receptor agonists approved for chronic weight management among patients who have obesity or overweight and other weight-related conditions — including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or obstructive sleep apnea — include liraglutide (Saxenda®), semaglutide (Wegovy®), and most recently, tirzepatide (Zepbound®).
GLP-1 receptor agonists activate the GLP-1 receptors located in the hypothalamus in the brain, which regulates food intake. By activating these receptors, GLP-1 receptor agonists decrease the feeling of hunger and causes the patient to eat less. GLP-1 receptor agonists also bind to the GLP-1 receptors on certain neurons in the brain to decrease hunger and increase satiety. They have been shown to slow gastric emptying within the first hour of eating, resulting in the feeling of being full. Patients who use GLP-1 receptor agonists experience reduced appetite and hunger, lower preference for high calorie foods, decrease in food cravings, and better overall control of their eating habits.3
After weight loss, the body may compensate by lowering the amount of circulatory weight regulating hormones, such as leptin. GLP-1 receptor agonists contribute to weight loss maintenance by reducing the compensatory decrease of leptin in the body.3
GLP-1 receptor agonists are approved to treat patients with type 2 diabetes. Among these patients, the body both decreases insulin release and develops a resistance to already-released insulin, resulting in a decreased production of GLP-1 receptors.2
Among patients with type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 receptor agonists have many effects, such as improving insulin sensitivity, decreasing glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, slowing gastric emptying, increasing fullness, decreasing free fatty acid concentrations, and decreasing body weight. These medications also increase the GLP-1 receptors produced by the body.2
For patients with type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment options include:
Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher, whereas overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 kg/m2 to 29.9 kg/m2. GLP-1 receptor agonists approved for weight loss or weight management are subcutaneous injections. Treatment options include daily liraglutide (Saxenda®), once-weekly semaglutide (Wegovy®), and once-weekly tirzepatide (Zepbound®).4
These GLP-1 receptor agonists are approved for patients with obesity and for those with a BMI greater than 27 kg/m2 who are also diagnosed with weight-related conditions, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, or cardiovascular disease.
GLP-1 receptor agonists have a beneficial role in the management obesity, as the condition impairs GLP-1 secretions in the gut. Among this patient population, GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce appetite and, thus, reduce food intake, leading to long-term weight loss. The nausea and vomiting may occur as side effects of usage and do not significantly affect weight loss.4
Because of the slow gastric emptying, these medications can cause gastrointestinal issues, including nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. These adverse events mostly occur following a change in dose. Gradually increasing the dose has been shown to improve these side effects.1,5 Other side effects include hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis.1,5
These medications are also known to cause more serious side effects, such as acute pancreatitis and gallbladder disease.3,5 Some studies have shown links between GLP-1 receptor agonist use and risks for thyroid cancer and suicidal ideation, but these findings are not conclusive.4
GLP-1 receptor agonists can cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and vomiting. If this occurs, you should contact your provider, as you may need a lower dose of the medication. Your provider may recommend slowing the titration process, which could mean waiting longer than 4 weeks before increasing the dose of the medication to prevent nausea and vomiting.1
GLP-1 receptor agonists may cause injection site reactions. It is recommended to use a different injection site with each dose by rotating between the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.4
Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists has also been associated with more severe side effects such as gallbladder issues like cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and acute pancreatitis. However, these events are rare and require further research. 4,5
Among patients with type 2 diabetes, use of GLP-1 receptor agonists with other blood sugar-lowering medications, such as sulfonylureas and insulin, may increase the chance of hypoglycemia.6,7
Other medications such as combined birth control, acetaminophen, digoxin (Lanoxin®), and warfarin have decreased absorption when used with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Studies have shown that this reduction did not cause a decrease in the effect of the medication. However, it is recommended to take birth control and acetaminophen at least 1 hour before the GLP-1 receptor agonist. Patients receiving warfarin should frequently monitor their international normalized ratio (INR). 6,7
It is recommended to tell your physician about the medications you are taking before starting a GLP-1 receptor agonist. When taken with short-acting insulin or sulfonylureas, GLP-1 receptor agonists can increase your risk for low blood sugar.7
GLP-1 receptor agonists that are prescribed once weekly, such as semaglutide, dulaglutide, and long-acting release exenatide, are inactive and half-way eliminated in 5 to 7 days. Once-daily exenatide and lixisenatide are inactive and half-way eliminated in about 2.5 to 3 hours.5
The fat lost while taking GLP-1 receptor agonists is often gained back when the medication is stopped. The benefits to blood sugar levels are also often lost. In one study, patients who stopped liraglutide had a 70% gain in fat after 1 year. The study also found that patients who continued to exercise maintained weight loss post-treatment. Talk with your doctor about the best way to stop taking these medications.8

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/managing-racism-harmful-to-health/,Managing Racism May Be as Harmful to Health as Exposure to Racism,"I recently came across a provocative piece from June 2019 by Versey et al, looking at the process called appropriated racial oppression. The authors wrote: “The term appropriated racial oppression reframes the construct internalized racism as a process whereby members of a group appropriate a dominant group’s ideology, adapt their behavior, and perceive a subordinate status as deserved, natural, and inevitable.”
The authors are from well-known programs such as the Department of Psychology at Wesleyan University, the School of Social Work from Columbia University, and the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences from Washington University.
The topic of appropriated racial oppression is complex. Although I will stay out of the weeds of the article, there is plenty to chew on. The following excerpt from this bold piece describes the authors’ take:
“The novelty this article offers is twofold. First, we briefly discuss examples in which White supremacy affects both Whites and oppressed groups, highlighting ways in which appropriated racial oppression compromises mental health (Pyke, 2010). Secondly, we suggest that exploring how racism influences attitudes and behaviors in a range of ways presents new opportunities for research in psychology and public health. For oppressed groups in particular, we provide examples of how racism is negotiated on an individual level — beyond what has traditionally been conceptualized as self-hate. Finally, we discuss implications and suggestions for further study.”
That’s a lot to digest. Initially, I was a little put off by the process described where “White supremacy” affects White people. But what grabbed me is the primary focus on the negative health impact on our Non-White patients of the proposed phenomenon.
I think this paragraph helps highlight the impact of the “appropriated racial oppression” on Non-White patients:
“Appropriated racial oppression is insidious in that it centralizes and normalizes Whiteness in a way that infiltrates every component of one’s being — how one looks, the ways in which one speaks and behaves. Ultimately, a person of color may continually ask themselves, ‘What will White people think?’ before making a decision in order to adhere to norms deemed acceptable. As such, oppressed groups are burdened with navigating racial oppression using a range of coping strategies that collectively constitute forms of appropriated racial oppression.”
While this piece proved to me to be a bit of a mind-bender, clinicians like PAs and nurse practitioners can learn much from the article. It is also an excellent reminder for clinicians interested in understanding the complex impact on our patients of racism in medicine. It’s not as simple as we may sometimes think, but approaching this challenging and disturbing issue with the understanding that complexity abounds will position us well to wade into a better understanding of racism in medicine, and how it may impact our patients, both White and Non-White as well.","Jim Anderson, MPAS, PA-C, DFAAPA"

Clinicians, often contracted via agencies, are hired by the prison system to tend to the health needs of the inmates. However, sometimes these interactions lead to lawsuits against the clinician.
A federal law referred to as Section 1983 of the United States Code (officially 42 U.S.C. § 1983) allows people to sue state and local government employees who violated their Civil Rights. Almost 50 years ago, the Supreme Court recognized the right to adequate medical care in prisons, jails, and detainment facilities in a landmark case, Estelle v Gamble. In that case, the Court held that a ‘deliberate indifference to a prisoner’s medical needs’ violates the prisoner’s rights against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. The decision opened the door to lawsuits against prison medical providers.
Since then, hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against medical professionals, many filed by the inmates themselves.
Ms H was a nurse working in a pre-trial county detention facility for 5 years. Her work largely centered around the intake of new arrestees — obtaining medical history, medical information, and a list of current medications.
The facility had a medication verification policy that Ms H was required to follow. On several occasions, she had caught arrestees attempting to sneak illegal substances into the jail via prescription bottles. The policy required the provider, at a minimum, to identify the patient and outside prescriber, identify the name of the medication and dosage, obtain directions for use, the stop date of the medication, obtain the date on which the prescription was last filled, and the quantity dispensed.
Without this verification, a medical provider cannot dispense medication to an arrestee. The policy specified that “the option to decline should be invoked whenever medication is thought to be unnecessary or inappropriate …” but the decision not to dispense must be documented in the health record.
Ms H was performing intake on Mr L, a newly arrested man. As part of the intake, Ms H took Mr L’s blood pressure, which was 149/99. Ms H was not alarmed by the elevated blood pressure. In her experience, it was quite common for arrestees to exhibit high blood pressure.
During the intake process, Mr L told the nurse that he suffered from high blood pressure and that he had prescriptions for clonazepam, clonidine, and duloxetine. Mr L’s brother brought in the arrestee’s medications, which included clonidine, for blood pressure. Ms H counted the number of pills in the bottle, and based on the date of the prescription, she concluded that Mr L was not compliant with his blood pressure medication.
Mr L identified his pharmacy as Walgreens and Ms H called to verify his prescriptions. The pharmacist noted that Mr L’s current prescriptions were for clonazepam, duloxetine, and cyclobenzaprine, and that there were no active prescriptions for blood pressure medication. Since the pharmacy was unable to verify the blood pressure medication, Ms H could not dispense. She scheduled a follow-up appointment with medical for later in the week to determine whether Mr L needed the medication.
Mr. L was released from jail 2 days after he was brought in, and a few days before his scheduled appointment. On the date of his release, Ms H again took his blood pressure, which now was 136/86 – significantly lower than at intake. Four months later, Mr L was diagnosed with 2, 6-inch blood clots in his iliac artery, requiring a 10-hour surgery. After his recovery, Mr L sued Ms H, the jail, the city, and a number of other defendants for negligence, medical malpractice, and deliberate indifference to his medical needs.
The defendants moved to dismiss the case and all claims against the other defendants were dismissed. However, the deliberate indifference claim against Ms H survived initial review and was allowed to proceed.
Ms H made a motion for summary judgment, asking the judge to rule in her favor. She argued that she was not deliberately indifferent to the plaintiff’s serious medical needs. Ms H submitted an affidavit, the jail’s medication policies, the plaintiff’s jail medical records, and case law in support of her argument. Ms. H argued that she was unaware that Mr L had a serious medical condition; she did not consider a single high blood pressure reading a serious medical condition; and that she did not believe Mr L would suffer injury from not receiving blood pressure medication for 2 days.
In response, Mr L submitted an unsworn statement from a medical website about blood pressure and unauthenticated, partially-redacted medical record excerpts.
The court sided with Ms H, holding that she had properly followed the jail’s medication policy and that she understood the policy was important to prevent substance abuse in jail and to ensure that arrestees took only prescribed medications. Moreover, the court concluded that Mr L had failed to show that he was harmed as a result of not receiving blood pressure medication for 2 days and that Mr L had failed to establish a causal connection between not taking the medication for 2 days and the harm that befell him 4 months later. The court dismissed the case against Ms H.
This case failed to prove causation. Had the blood clots occurred the day that Mr L was released or soon thereafter, perhaps he might have had a better chance establishing causation. Nevertheless, the fact that Ms H followed the facility’s medication policy is strongly in her favor.
Following your facility’s medication policies, whether your facility is a jail or a hospital, is always the wise choice. Ms H further protected herself by documenting the reasons she wasn’t providing the medication and scheduling Mr L for a follow-up medical appointment to assess his high blood pressure.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/new-definition-for-long-covid/,National Academies Releases New Definition for Long COVID,"Long COVID should now be defined as “an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after COVID-19 infection and is present for at least 3 months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems,” according to a new National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report.
“While several working definitions currently exist, no common definition for Long COVID has been agreed upon. The lack of a consensus definition presents challenges for patients, clinicians, public health practitioners, researchers, and policymakers,” noted the report.  For patients, varying presentations of the disease and competing definitions can lead to difficulties accessing medical care or obtaining support, skepticism and dismissal of their experiences, delayed or denied treatment, and social stigma.
Recognizing the need for broad input and an improved definition, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) asked the National Academies to edfine Long COVID. The committee that wrote the report engaged more than 1300 participants in its activities, with a focus on interdisciplinary dialogue and the patient perspective.
The report says the new Long COVID definition can be applied to many purposes — including clinical care and diagnosis; eligibility for health services, insurance coverage, disability benefits, and school or workplace accommodations; public health; social services; policymaking; epidemiology and surveillance; private and public research; and public awareness and education, especially for patients and their families and caregivers.
“The lack of a consistent definition for Long COVID has hampered research and delayed diagnosis and care for patients,” said Harvey Fineberg, president of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and chair of the authoring committee. “Our committee hopes this single definition, crafted with input from across research and patient communities, will help to educate the public about this widespread and highly consequential disease state.”
OASH’s Office of Long COVID Research and Practice and the Long COVID Coordination Council, comprised of 14 federal agencies, will lead the effort to disseminate and implement the new definition.
“Long COVID is a devastatingly persistent result of the COVID-19 pandemic that the medical community has yet to fully address,” said Victor J. Dzau, president of the National Academy of Medicine. “Serving this patient population through better-coordinated care, more definitive diagnoses, and more efficient and streamlined research are important next steps for addressing its impact.”
Long COVID (LC) is an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least 3 months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems.
LC manifests in multiple ways. A complete enumeration of possible signs, symptoms, and diagnosable conditions of LC would have hundreds of entries. Any organ system can be involved, and LC patients can present with:
Important features are:
Long COVID occurs after COVID-19 infection but does not require laboratory confirmation or other proof of the initial infection. The definition emphasizes that Long COVID can follow infections of any severity, including asymptomatic infections, whether they were initially recognized or not.
The definition says symptoms should be present for at least three months, whether consistent or relapsing and remitting, for a Long COVID diagnosis to be made. Because there is still ambiguity regarding the relationship between the timing of COVID-19 infection relative to Long COVID onset, the committee chose not to include a maximum latency period.
The definition does not list any symptoms or conditions as being required or any as being exclusionary. While some examples of specific symptoms are included in the definition, they are not meant to be exhaustive or to dismiss the significance of other symptoms or conditions. A complete enumeration of signs, symptoms, and diagnosable conditions of Long COVID would have more than 200 entries.
The definition emphasizes that some individuals with Long COVID are severely affected and can have a variety of activity limitations. This can profoundly affect patients’ and caregivers’ lives and is an important feature of Long COVID.
The report recognizes that socioeconomic factors, inequality, discrimination (based on race and gender, among others), bias, and stigma affect whether patients can receive a diagnosis and benefit from Long COVID-targeted health care or services. These factors include but are not limited to access to COVID-19 testing during acute illness, access to evaluation for possible Long COVID, willingness of physicians to diagnose a particular patient, access to insurance benefits, and patients’ fears of stigmatization that could result from having a Long COVID diagnosis.
A research agenda centered around improving the definition could focus on the key definition elements articulated in the report: attribution to infection, time, clinical features, equity, functional impairment, exclusions and alternative diagnoses, biomarkers and laboratory criteria, and risk factors.
Undertaken by the Committee on Examining the Working Definition for Long COVID, the study was sponsored by the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health.",Clinical Advisor Contributing Writer

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/hcv-treatment-disparities/,HCV Treatment Disparities: What Contributes to Gaps in Health Care Access?,"Over the years, efficacious hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapies have become available. In 2011, first-generation direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents were introduced, although these agents exhibited several drug-drug interactions.2 Then, in 2014, safe and efficacious DAA options became available, contributing to an HCV cure rate of over 95%.1
However, despite efficacious HCV therapies, HCV treatment disparities abound. The CDC reports that only 1 in 3 individuals with insurance receives prompt HCV treatment. Notably, people with the public health insurance Medicaid are 46% less likely to receive HCV treatment compared with individuals with private insurance.1
“Having these extremely effective therapies didn’t really translate to people who have the highest prevalence of disease and would benefit from treatment and cure having access to these therapies,” said Seun O. Falade-Nwulia, MBBS, MPH, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
Early detection of HCV infection is critical to prevent progressive liver damage, advanced liver disease, liver cancer, significant morbidity, or mortality. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of HCV infection also prevents further spread of the disease.1
Stuart Ray, MD, another infectious disease specialist and professor at Johns Hopkins, commented on the effects of conclusions drawn from research studies. Researchers’ commentary has affected insurance coverage for specific therapies. For example, Dr Ray mentioned, the authors of a 2017 Cochrane systematic review concluded that DAA therapies had questionable clinical effectiveness on reducing HCV-related mortality based on existing randomized trials and low-quality evidence.3 The researchers’ statements ultimately prompted insurance coverage restrictions for these life-saving treatments.
However, several infectious disease experts published counterarguments to the researchers’ conclusions.4 HCV experts argued that none of the randomized clinical trials were designed to assess HCV-related mortality, since the studies’ follow-up periods were far too short to determine long-term clinical effects of DAAs on decompensated cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. The average follow-up duration for these studies was 34 weeks.5
According to a study published in 2022, Medicaid programs in 23 US states continued to restrict HCV treatment based on at least 1 of 2 required criteria for treatment authorization, including abstinence from substance use and severity of liver disease.6 According to these criteria, individuals were eligible to receive HCV treatment if they were sober or if they had documented liver fibrosis.1
A more recent analysis of 39 state Medicaid programs published in April 2024 reported that 7 states eliminated HCV coverage restrictions, 25 states eased restrictions, and 7 continued to maintain the same restrictions imposed on HCV treatment from 2015 to 2019. Consequently, DAA usage increased exponentially by 996 treatment courses per every 100,000 Medicaid beneficiaries with the relaxation of DAA coverage restrictions.7
“Inequities in access to insurance and the type of insurance both contribute to HCV treatment inequities,” Dr Falade-Nwulia said. “Populations at higher risk for HCV infection include those who use drugs and those of lower socioeconomic status, so invariably those patients have public insurance, which often has limitations on coverage and a number of hoops that patients must jump through to receive care.”
In addition, DAA therapies remain expensive, Dr Falade-Nwulia explained. As a result, patients may not be able to afford out-of-pocket costs. Patients, therefore, rely on insurance for treatment coverage. Unfortunately, many patients who live in regions with no Medicaid expansion do not have access to insurance.
“There are very few diseases that we can cure, and, more importantly, diseases for which we deny access to care,” Dr Falade-Nwulia said. “That’s why prior authorization requirements for HCV treatment leave many patients at risk [for] death, which is entirely preventable.”
Provider specialization also may restrict approval of some types of insurance coverage. Under these restrictions, only liver specialists or infectious disease specialists are allowed to prescribe DAAs and require preauthorization from the insurance company before writing the prescription.1
Dr Falade-Nwulia stressed the importance of appointing and training a wide range of providers to test for and treat HCV infection. “These treatments are so simple and effective. They don’t have many side effects and there is data demonstrating that so many provider types do just as well as specialists in treating the condition,” she said.
Prior authorization is required for individuals with public insurance and certain private insurances in many parts of the US. It involves a clinician seeing a patient, writing a note, and submitting blood work to insurance. Then, Dr Falade-Nwulia explained, the insurance company must “review the paperwork and make the determination whether the patient is deserving of the medication that we know is effective … in preventing morbidity due to liver cirrhosis and mortality due to liver-related death.”
“Prior authorization is a big barrier to HCV treatment because patients have to wait sometimes as long as a month for this authorization,” she added. “Things can happen during that time, so that when the authorization comes through, the patient may not be ready or able to undergo treatment or simply be lost to follow-up. Patients often are dealing with so many competing priorities — homelessness, shelter, food, transportation.”
Another potential factor that may affect HCV treatment-seeking behaviors among individuals with the virus is the stigma associated with the condition. Patients with HCV infection who have a higher level of disease-related knowledge, particularly regarding disease transmission, also have a greater perception of HCV-related stigma, according to a cross-sectional survey published in 2021.8
Disease-based stigma has been found to influence health behaviors, including disease disclosure, treatment uptake, and treatment adherence.8 HCV-affected individuals may hesitate to pursue life-saving treatment due to the perceived stigma, further contributing to treatment barriers.
“Stigma is such a big part of why we are losing the battle against the HCV epidemic in the US,” Dr Falade-Nwulia said. “A lot of people associate hepatitis C with injection drug use or other behaviors that are viewed by society as moral failings, but we now understand that substance use disorders are medical conditions that are treatable.”
Many people with HCV who use drugs may shy away from the health care system, Dr Falade-Nwulia explained. Stigma is a contributing factor for this behavior, both anticipatory and realized stigma, where individuals fear negative experiences or actually experience them.
“There are ways to address these barriers, such as providing care in a stigma-free zone where there are no restrictions to HCV treatment access based on history of substance use as well as increasing the number of options for places where people can seek care, so that no matter where people are engaging with the health care system, they have the potential to get diagnosed in a nonjudgmental and nonstigmatizing manner,” Dr Falade-Nwulia added. “And if that testing is positive, the provider should be able to immediately treat the patient or have access to resources in their local community where patients can quickly access care without having to wait 6 months to see a specialist.”
Black individuals are disproportionately affected by HCV infection.9 In 2020, the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health (HHS OMH) reported that Black individuals are almost twice as likely to die from HCV infection than White individuals.10
Similarly, in 2018, the HHS OMH reported that Hispanic individuals are 40% more likely to die from HCV infection compared with non-Hispanic White individuals, even though rates of infection were actually lower in this racial community.11
“Data suggest that the Hispanic population is less likely to have access to or receive treatment for HCV,” Dr Falade-Nwulia said. “Similarly, people who are Black have lower rates of treatment. This may be due to not having enough providers in the community to treat HCV and also lack of medical providers who are trusted is a big concern in many of these communities. Medical mistrust is huge and if you do not have providers that are trusted, it might reduce the likelihood of patients seeking care.”
There is a high prevalence of HCV infections that go untreated in jails and prisons, according to Dr Falade-Nwulia. Individuals without HCV who enter these environments may acquire HCV, which makes incarceration a risk factor for HCV infection.
“As we think about evidence-based approaches to addressing this issue, one of the things that has so much power is testing and treating people for HCV while they are incarcerated,” Dr Falade-Nwulia added. “This approach has the benefit of actually curing people of a potentially life-threatening disease at a time when they are stable, and it reduces the likelihood of new people who aren’t infected coming into the prison and acquiring the infection. It also helps to reduce the transmission of HCV infection in the surrounding communities near prisons after people leave the prison and go out into these communities. Not only does this approach improve the health of the individual, but also the health of the local population by preventing HCV transmission to other people.”
“Pragmatically, it is all about economics,” Dr Falade-Nwulia said. “We have lessons learned from other places, like Australia, which have achieved broad access to HCV treatments. In Australia, they have implemented a model where there are partnerships between the government and industry, so that the drug manufacturing companies can receive the return on investment for drug development while patients continue to receive access to treatment.”
Certain states, such as Louisiana, are attempting a so-called “Netflix model of care,” a direct-to-consumer health care model in which Louisiana’s state government pays pharmaceutical companies in exchange for a full course of medication for up to 40,000 state residents receiving Medicaid or who are incarcerated.
“With the Netflix model of care, there is an agreement to have an unlimited number of doses or fixed number of doses [of HCV treatments] for a fixed cost that the health care system can afford,” Dr Falade-Nwulia said. “This guarantees that the largest number of patients have access to these life-saving therapies, but also guarantees the return on investment for the drug manufacturers. It takes public-private partnership. Underlying it all is the understanding that we need to address the health of the public.”
Another model of care that may help to combat HCV treatment disparities by improving access to HCV treatment is using patient navigators. Dr Falade-Nwulia emphasized that trusting the person providing information and care is very important. Patient navigators can help patients to follow through with each of the multiple steps needed for effective HCV treatment.
“The key is engaging with patients in settings where they already have trust and are already accessing services,” she said. “This may require integrating HCV testing and treatment at a physical location, such as a community-based drop-in center, where people who use drugs are already accessing services.”
During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine became more widely used as a means for patients and providers to remotely continue care. Health care providers have continued to find ways to integrate telemedicine into clinical practice to treat patients that are unable to attend in-person appointments for several reasons, such as lack of transportation or time or living too far away from the clinic.
According to an abstract presented at the 2023 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Liver Meeting, facilitated telemedicine helps providers overcome geographic and temporal obstacles to health care access for HCV treatment, resulting in significantly higher sustained virological response rates among individuals affected by HCV with opioid use disorder as well as reductions in drug use, which in turn minimizes rates of HCV reinfection for over 2 years.12
However, lack of access to computers or smartphones may be a barrier to HCV treatment, since not all patients can afford the technology required for a telemedicine visit.
“Telemedicine is a powerful tool,” Dr Falade-Nwulia said. “The health care system must be nimble to meet the needs of a broad range of patients, which is what equitable health care is all about.”
Dr Falade-Nwulia emphasized the need to develop and implement strategies to achieve milestones as recommended by the World Health Organization and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.
“We should be diagnosing at least 90% of those infected with HCV and treating at least 80% of those found to have infection with the understanding that, if we do that, we can achieve a 65% reduction in the morbidity and mortality related to HCV,” Dr Falade-Nwulia said. “These therapies are so incredibly effective and safe — just 1 to 3 pills taken 1 time a day for 8 to 12 weeks with literally no side effects and such high cure rates.”
A 90% reduction in incident HCV infections is an important benchmark, she explained, but incident HCV infections in the US have increased since 2015.
“HCV testing is not part of routine care and often patients are not even aware that they are infected,” Dr Falade-Nwulia said. “New guidelines can move practice in the right direction. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is now recommending HCV screening for all adults, but it takes time for providers to catch up.”
She is particularly excited about a new proposal before Congress to have funds that are delineated for HCV elimination being led by Francis Collins.
“HCV testing right now is a two-stage process where one test is for an antibody, which is a marker of exposure, and the second test is for HCV RNA, which indicates an ongoing infection,” she added. “Up until now, we don’t have a point of care HCV RNA test in the US, but it would be a game changer if patients could go to their doctor, get this test, and know definitively that they have an HCV infection, so that the provider can initiate treatment immediately. If approved, funds will support access to point-of-care HCV RNA diagnostics, utilize a subscription model approach to increase access to HCV treatment in a wide range of settings, and get the US on track to eliminating HCV as a public health threat.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/infertility-and-mental-health/,Distressing Cycles: Infertility and Mental Health Warrant New Approach,"Research and real-world data have shown that treatment with assisted reproductive technology (ART) such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) results in an increased risk for mental health conditions — including psychologic distress — among both men and women.1
Approximately 10% of individuals of reproductive age in the United States have infertility. Patients have described infertility as a “roller coaster” of emotions that causes an increase in anxiety, stress, and depression, as some of those who seek ART also meet the criteria for major psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, and dysthymia.2
In addition, “Infertility is associated with a multitude of losses including changes in important relationships, loss of financial savings for other life goals, failed fertility treatments and recurrent pregnancy loss,” noted Brennan Peterson, PhD, professor of marriage and family therapy and psychology at Crean College of Health and Behavioral Sciences at Chapman University, California. “Coping with loss is emotionally challenging and is a process, as opposed to a one-time event.”
May 2024 is Mental Health Awareness Month, Maternal Mental Health Month, and Women’s Health Month. This year, we are focusing on the link between IVF and mental health among both men and women, such as: the effect of infertility and IVF on mental health; whether poor mental health leads to unfavorable IVF treatment outcomes; meaningful patient-provider communication; and, the role of collaboration between specialties to address mental health conditions among this patient population.
Previous research findings suggest that between 25% and 60% of patients with infertility have psychiatric symptoms and higher levels of anxiety and depression than those without infertility.3
Although some studies show that psychologic distress may be linked to infertility,1,3 a recent report indicates conflicting published data regarding the role of stress in fertility or overall pregnancy rates.2 However, the impact of distress on treatment outcomes may be more challenging to determine because of factors such as self-report measures.3
G. David Adamson, MD, FRCSC, FACOG, FACS, a clinical professor and adjunct clinical faculty at Stanford University, associate clinical professor at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and founder, chairman, and CEO at ARC® Fertility, discussed the prevalence of psychiatric conditions among men and women receiving fertility treatments, noting that the majority of women and a significant proportion of men undergoing IVF have anxiety and depression.
“As both women and men go through multiple IVF treatment cycles, their emotional, financial, and physical investment becomes higher, which causes depression and anxiety to continue to increase,” he said, “There may also be the presence of mental health conditions before and during treatment for reasons such as inadequate response to treatment, costs, and history of miscarriage.”
In a survey-based study led by Zachary Walker, MD, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, primary results showed that both men with and without anxiety and/or depression undergoing IVF had similar rates of live births, regardless of antidepressant treatment. On the basis of these findings, Walker and colleagues urged providers to assess for mental health among men receiving IVF treatment.4
Approximately 2% of live births in the US are a result of IVF, which prompted Stanford researchers to look into the outcomes among offspring of parents with infertility. The population-based analysis showed that offspring of men or women with infertility had an increased risk for mental health and developmental disorders, such as psychosis, autism, or intellectual disability.5
Patients with infertility who are undergoing fertility treatment may underreport their levels of psychologic distress or mental health status. The use of formal screening tools for mental health is not a common practice at these clinics, but many experts recommend screening this subset of patients for mental health concerns.1
In fact, the 2023 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guideline update suggests depression and anxiety screening during the perinatal and postpartum period using standardized validated instruments. However, there is no specific guidance for patients undergoing fertility treatments.2,6
So, what is the screening protocol for mental health at IVF centers?
Dr Walker said that providers at his workplace routinely discuss with patients the effects of infertility diagnoses and treatment options on mental health during the first visit. “If there is concern for anxiety, depression, or other mental health disorders, referrals are typically placed to a social worker specialized in infertility and who may further recommend a psychiatrist consult, if needed,” he stated. “However, all patients who are using third-party reproduction (ie, donor sperm or egg) will meet with the social worker to discuss mental health.”
Dr Adamson also mentioned that many IVF clinics have effective interventions and screening for anxiety and depression at the intake consultation, as well as during treatment. He said, “Patients with mental health conditions are provided support by mental health professionals, along with clinics providing information to promote education and awareness.”
However, patients with infertility who are undergoing treatment have reported dissatisfaction due to provider communication, lack of personalized care, negative attitude among staff, and inattention to emotional well-being, which have resulted in stress and discontinuation of infertility treatment.2
Dr Adamson explained, “Many women are not treated by their fertility specialists first, maybe resulting in lesser awareness of the burden faced by patients. Because of constraints in time and expertise, the needs of men or women with infertility are not met in that setting.”
Is there an association between mental health and IVF treatment outcomes?
Recent study findings did not indicate a link of anxiety or depression with IVF outcomes among men,4 to which Dr Walker reiterated, “Starting treatment for mental health is not the absolute solution to infertility. There are many outside factors to a successful outcome with IVF.”
Dr Adamson added, “Previously women were somehow ‘blamed’ for not getting pregnant — basically saying that if their emotional health is poor, they couldn’t get pregnant. But I think data on that perspective are very limited. However, this depends on the degree of anxiety as well; the emotional state is contributing to components of fertility that are needed for pregnancy.” Overall, “The burden associated with infertility is a result of the infertility and not a cause of it.”
To address mental health outcomes among this population, experts recommended:
Furthermore, in a 2021 paper, Holley and colleagues discuss potential questions that patients ask and responses that providers can offer, some of which included counseling patients for depression and anxiety after failed IVF cycles, the association between stress and infertility, and information about finding support groups in the area.7
According to Walker et al, both partners must be counseled for mental health disorders during fertility treatment. In addition, mental health treatment, including antidepressants, must be considered irrespective of fertility goals.4
Mental health professionals must be integrated into the IVF system to derive the maximum benefits to achieve patient-centered care. Medical societies, such as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), should consider adding standardized recommendations for mental health providers in the fertility team.
Overall, in terms of collaboration between specialists, integrated models of onsite counseling services/mental health providers and clinicians may be beneficial.7 The role of psychologic interventions for patients with infertility must be incorporated and highlighted in ART clinics.2,3
Along with reproductive health specialists and endocrinologists, primary care providers should also improve their awareness of screening tools for patients with stress and mental health concerns related to infertility. This approach can help in the early identification and treatment of mental health issues, which leads to improved patient outcomes.1

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/epilepsy-the-transition-from-pediatric-to-adult-health-care/,Living With Epilepsy: The Transition From Pediatric to Adult Health Care,"The “successful” transition from a pediatric care to an adult care system for adolescents living with epilepsy is a complex process that involves changes in the patient-provider relationship and navigation of systemic barriers.1 Transition of care typically requires extensive coordination and planning by a multidisciplinary team of health care providers, especially for youth with medical or social complexity.2
Approximately 20% of the United States population are transition-aged individuals (12-26 years) and nearly one-third of those individuals have 1 or more chronic conditions.3 Children with epilepsy are at an increased risk for unmet health care needs.4
Nicholas Beimer, MD, a clinical associate professor and the director of EEG Laboratory and Inpatient Epilepsy Monitoring at the Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry at Michigan Medicine, spoke about the effects of age on epilepsy outcomes.
“There is a good chance that patients can ‘grow out’ of seizures in certain types of genetic epilepsy syndromes, many of which start in children. In general, the majority of patients living with epilepsy have seizures that are well-controlled with treatment.5 However, that also means that the remaining patient population have refractory seizures and experience recurrent seizures despite treatment,” explained Dr Beimer.
Identifying and addressing barriers in the transition care process is important for improving outcomes and building effective care models for the future.4
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), along with the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the American College of Physicians (ACP), updated the 2011 clinical report on health care transition based on the latest research and practice-based evidence. Updates were made to guidance regarding the preparation for transition, integration into adult health care, implementation of strategies using quality improvement methods, and education and training for health care professionals caring for those with pediatric-onset disease.6
In honor of Epilepsy Awareness Week, which runs from May 26 to June 2, 2024, Neurology Advisor is focusing on current gaps in the transition of care process and the measures clinicians can take to address those gaps; communication between patients, caregivers, and providers; as well as the education and awareness that is necessary for patient-centered care and improved outcomes.
Over the years, health care transition has evolved from being a pediatric responsibility to a shared responsibility between both pediatric and adult care teams, which includes clinicians, nurses, and social workers.5 Young adults, especially those living with conditions such as epilepsy, comprise a vulnerable population with unique needs, often resulting in challenges in the transition and transfer of care from a pediatric to adult provider.4
“Transition is typically a 3-part process — planning, transfer, and integration to adult health care; however, most physicians do not follow a standard process of doing this,” noted Patience White, MD, co-director of Got Transition® and professor of medicine and pediatrics at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC.
A substantial proportion of children with active seizures and/or epilepsy-related comorbidities receiving treatment with antiseizure medications (ASMs) require continued care with specialists, such as neurologists or epileptologists, into adulthood.4
“However, finding a clinician with special expertise is not always easy and takes planning, especially given the considerable burden already weighing on the adult health care system,” Dr White remarked.
Less than half of pediatric patients with epilepsy report receiving care by an adult epilepsy provider after transition.4 In fact, approximately 75% of adult patients living with epilepsy still report visiting and receiving care from their pediatric neurologists.2
According to Dr White, this is understandable. “Patients form long-term relationships with their pediatric providers, so transition is, of course, challenging,” she explained.
Although structured transition programs have been recommended for children with special needs and have yielded improved outcomes, there are few transition programs for those living with epilepsy. General transition readiness assessments address developing health care skills; however, young patients with epilepsy need additional condition-specific knowledge.1
A focus group of caregivers to children with Dravet syndrome, a rare type of epilepsy, indicated dissatisfaction in the ability of existing transition programs to provide adequate patient care. In the 2020 study, published in Epilepsy & Behaviors, 2 the caregivers reported that these programs were starting too late into the transition period and described them as “not for our kids.”
One of the key factors that plays a role in improving transition readiness is ensuring the transition starts at an early age. However, conversations regarding transition, which is recommended to be had at age 13, are often only initiated at age 18, right before the transition to an adult health system is taking place.7
Dr Beimer noted, “The age at which the patient changes over care is interesting because this practice can vary significantly among clinics and institutions. Standard ages of transition occur from as early as 16 to as late as 21. It isn’t entirely clear what the best age of transfer should be.”
Only one-third of young adults with active epilepsy have transition preparation discussions, the majority of which focus on the patient’s comorbid neurodevelopmental disorder history and epilepsy care provider at the time of last contact.4
Successful transition of care depends on the dismantling of structural and psychosocial barriers, including adult providers’ lack of expertise in pediatric-onset conditions and developmental disabilities, inadequate planning by individual physicians and institutions at large, and potential trust issues that are inherent in a new patient-provider relationship.2
“The biggest barrier, however, is in the lack of planning, and part of the planning is helping youth develop their skills to manage their own health and health care,” said Dr White.
Additional barriers in transition care include low socioeconomic status, lack of insurance, poor accessibility, limited psychosocial functioning, and age.Many young adults also consider health care a low priority compared with other facets of their transition, such as education, housing, and relationships.6
The existing barriers should encourage providers to better prepare for the transition and transfer of patients living with epilepsy to adult care. Using an epilepsy-specific measure of transition readiness to identify targets for skill-building intervention may be beneficial.7
A team of researchers at Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan designed and validated a condition-specific transition readiness assessment tool, EpiTRAQ, for adolescents and young adults with epilepsy.1
“Both child and adult neurologists should understand that transition occurs over years prior to and after the actual transfer of care between clinics, and it requires continuous and thorough communication between clinics, patients, and caregivers,” said Dr Beimer.
Supporting transition typically involves a structured process in helping youth with epilepsy gain confidence and independence in managing their health care.1 To address the gaps in transition care, the AAP, in collaboration with the AAFP and ACP, developed the Six Core Elements of Health Care Transition, a structured clinical approach customizable for use in various practices employing diverse transition care models.6 The Six Core Elements include:
“This transition process enables practices and providers to think about what to tell their patients during the transition years, and beginning this process early on is very important. This gives the family and youth time to get ready for this change,” explained Dr White, lead author of the clinical report.
Dr Beimer added, “Counseling patients often occurs as part of the education in regularly scheduled follow-up appointments in short sessions over multiple visits, which include verbal discussions, reviewing tip sheets, and watching recorded presentations. Patients and caregivers usually interact with different providers in this setting, including nurse educators, advanced practice providers, physicians, or a combination of all of the above.”
According to the results of a registered nurse-led 2020 study published in the Journal of Pediatric Nursing,8 transition education can be provided to adolescents during scheduled inpatient admissions in the epilepsy unit. This conclusion was justified by 100% of the included patients reporting increased knowledge of transition after receiving education during admission. Further, a shared responsibility of providing transition education between inpatient and ambulatory providers may be feasible if this information is incorporated into electronic health records (EHRs).8
“We have an electronic version of the questionnaire set up in our EHR, which gets delivered to patients every 6 months between the ages of 16 and 26, and this helps prompt the discussion [of transition] at regular follow up appointments,”1 said Dr Beimer.
Notes Dr White, “At my clinical practice, we provide youth and parents with transition readiness documents separately, and have them discuss it together. It’s interesting to see parents learn what the youth knows and does not know, and it helps them prepare for the things they’re going to need in the future.”
“Completing readiness assignments between the ages 14 and 18 can be beneficial. As the age for transition draws nearer, it’s essential to have a medical summary to provide to the next adult clinician, as well as the patient, along with a ‘transfer package,’ especially for the more complex cases,” she added.
There are several resources available for health care professionals, shared Dr White, including those involved in the care of patients living with epilepsy:

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/expert-interview-update-on-aha-guidelines-series/,Expert Interview: Update on AHA’s Get With The Guidelines Series,"Nearly 25 years ago, the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Stroke Association developed the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG) series1,2 to increase the consistent implementation of guidelines-based care in hospitals for patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke.1-3
The GWTG suite of programs aims to improve patient care and outcomes through resources such as provider education, quality improvement measures, and patient registries, with an overarching goal of reducing death and disability associated with CVD and stroke.4,5
For updates on the current status and achievements of the GWTG series, Cardiology Advisor interviewed AHA volunteer Gregg Fonarow, MD, FAHA, interim chief of the division of cardiology and the Eliot Corday Chair in Cardiovascular Medicine and Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Dr Fonarow is also director of the Ahmanson-UCLA Cardiomyopathy Center and co-director of the UCLA Preventative Cardiology Program.
Dr Fonarow: In 1999, AHA volunteers identified a need to establish a mechanism by which hospitals could stay up to date with the latest clinical guidelines and recommendations to improve cardiovascular care quality and clinical outcomes. The AHA had set an ambitious goal to reduce death and disability due to CVD by 25% by 2010.1 With that goal in mind, AHA created the very first GWTG module for coronary artery disease, beginning with a regional pilot program. Based on this initial success, GWTG expanded nationally in 2001 and then launched additional modules.6
This performance-improvement, registry-based approach would allow sites to evaluate their patient population against the most recent guideline-directed medical therapies, engage in collaborative learning, and share best practices. In addition to the technical support for the effort, AHA introduced the role of Quality Improvement consultants. Every GWTG hospital is provided a skilled quality consultant to assist as they use the registry to report on performance, identify opportunities for process improvement, and support their facility accreditation and certification with data from the registry. Sites also have the opportunity to be recognized by the AHA for their consistent performance.
GWTG is now available for atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease including chest pain, heart failure, stroke, and resuscitation to support cardiac arrest care.2
Dr Fonarow: All GWTG modules are associated with significant improvements in multiple processes of care strongly linked to improved outcomes. The AHA’s 2010 Strategic Goal was able to be met 3 years early, in 2007, in part based on GWTG.6
Currently, more than 2,600 US hospitals participate in one or more GWTG program module. That means nearly 80% of the American population has access to the program. Plus, since the creation of the program, more than 13 million US patient records have been entered into the registry.2
A few of the most significant achievements include:
Dr Fonarow: Understanding quality measurement is critical to improving patient care and making the certification process simple. Participating hospitals take their efforts a step further to ensure teams are using current guideline-directed treatments, setting best in class goals, and using peer benchmarks to compare performance. The integration of the most current guidelines is a key benefit to sites.
Each participating hospital and health system works with a program consultant to implement, interpret data, identify areas for improvement, and articulate recommendations internally. It’s like having a consultant for the organization’s quality improvement objectives – and a significant reason these programs are so successful.
Also, the GWTG registry tool collects data from participating hospitals, allowing health care leaders and researchers to examine trends and continue bringing current evidence-based guidance to care delivery at hospitals across the country.
Dr Fonarow: As with any therapy, there are contraindications to some treatments, and collecting information on contraindications is actually built into the registry. Sites are provided the opportunity to document the reason why a patient was excluded from the treatment and can use that information to evaluate overall treatment and considerations for process improvement. And of course, the final decision on treatment resides with the patient and their caregivers. They can decide against a treatment, and GWTG allows for that documentation.
Dr Fonarow: Until recently, the biggest gap in reaching all hospitals pertained to the small or rural hospital. These sites were less likely to join the quality improvement program due to resource limitations and low volumes of patients. However, the data shows these residents are at 30% higher risk of stroke, 40% more likely to develop heart disease, and live an average of 3 years fewer than urban counterparts.10 Yet, when rural hospitals did participate in GWTG, care quality improved, and in many cases performance rivaled that of urban hospitals. The AHA has now launched the Rural Community Network, which is open to all rural hospitals to join GWTG. This program aims to help close those gaps. More than 350 new hospitals have signed up so far.
As newer therapies are discovered, tested, proven to provide patient-centered outcomes, and are integrated into the national guidelines, these therapies can be rapidly integrated into GWTG. The program aims to further enhance these processes, so that each patient receives the best evidence-based care at the right time, at the right dose, equitably, reliably, every time. This is aligned with the AHA’s goal of advancing cardiovascular health for all, including identifying and removing barriers to health care access and quality.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/dilated-cardiomyopathy-and-celiac-disease-possible-association/,Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Celiac Disease: a Possible Association,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and celiac disease (CD) are distinctly different medical conditions with varying presentations. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a disease in which progressive left ventricular dilation results in weakened contraction of the heart in the absence of coronary artery disease or any abnormal loading conditions.1 Celiac disease is an immune-mediated, chronic inflammatory disorder caused by the consumption of gluten, which occurs in genetically susceptible individuals.2,3 The link between DCM and CD is not well established, but recent studies have sparked an interest in exploring the connection between these disorders.
Dilated cardiomyopathy is categorized as a mixed primary disorder that fits within the classification of genetic and nongenetic etiologies.4 It affects a wide range of individuals, from children to older adults, has a multitude of etiologies, and is a common cause of non-ischemic heart failure. Animal models have shown that left ventricular dilation will cause fibrosis and remodeling of the left ventricle.5 The scarring and fibrosis result in decreased cardiac output because of a combination of decreased stroke volume, impaired ventricular contraction, and increased end-diastolic pressure.5
The body attempts to compensate for the changes occurring within the ventricles by altering the vascular system through increasing systemic vascular resistance, decreasing arterial compliance, and increasing venous pressure and blood volume.6 This results in an increase of both cardiac preload and afterload, which contributes to increased wall stress. Diastole encompasses both active relaxation and passive compliance. In patients with DCM, diastolic dysfunction can affect both components, and also cause a decrease in systolic function. Impaired ventricular relaxation leads to a reduction in rapid ventricular filling.5
Dilated cardiomyopathy presents with a broad spectrum of clinical features, ranging from asymptomatic to severe manifestations of heart failure. The clinical manifestations of DCM are typically not dependent on the underlying cause.6 Instead, the signs and symptoms observed in DCM patients reflect the underlying myocardial dysfunction, impaired cardiac output, and fluid overload. Although some individuals present with mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, approximately 80% of patients present with symptoms of heart failure. 5 These symptoms encompass a range of manifestations such as edema, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, diaphoresis, and fatigue following exertion.7
Diagnostic testing plays a pivotal role in confirming DCM, guiding treatment decisions, and assessing prognosis. A number of modalities are used; however, echocardiogram has been shown to be one of the most important methods for diagnosis and is the best method for assessment of systolic function.5,8 It allows for the assessment of ventricular size, wall thickness, systolic function, and the presence of valvular abnormalities.9
As DCM progresses in severity, the left ventricle exhibits an alteration in shape, resulting in a more spherical structure. While an echocardiogram is a good first-line modality, another valuable test is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cardiac MRIs have been regarded as the most reliable method for assessment of volume, mass and ejection fraction of the ventricles.9 Cardiac MRI can discover, evaluate, and characterize differing myocardial tissue types, allowing for the diagnosis of specific etiologies and types of DCM.5,6,9,10
Dilated cardiomyopathy, if left untreated, will progress to heart failure and death. Therefore, the management of this cardiomyopathy is conducted by increasing cardiac output and function.5 Two classes of patients with DCM exist when determining treatment options: those with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction and those with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.11 Treatment for individuals within the asymptomatic class of DCM consists of managing hypertension and lifestyle modifications to prevent the progression to heart failure. Treatment for individuals with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction includes lifestyle modifications, initiation of pharmacologic treatments such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, aldosterone antagonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors, as well as cardiac resynchronization therapy and surgery if required.5,11
Celiac disease is common, with a global prevalence of up to 1%, and is underdiagnosed.12,13 Individuals at risk of CD have HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 genes present, which are vital for the manifestation of CD.14 HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 cause the immune system to recognize gluten as foreign, resulting in an activated immune response that leads to the damage of villi within the small intestine, which hinders the absorption of nutrients and water.14
Celiac disease presents with a broad spectrum of clinical features, ranging from asymptomatic to severe. Some on the more common manifestations include gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, weight loss, abdominal pain, and bloating. The disease can also present with extraintestinal symptoms such as anemia, elevated liver enzymes, dermatitis herpetiformis, and osteoporosis.14
A diagnosis of CD can be made from a combination of clinical features and serologic and histologic evaluations. Guidelines for diagnostic testing for CD state that serology is used as a first line, followed by an endoscopy with duodenal biopsy. Using these diagnostic tests, 4 out of 5 criteria must be met for the diagnosis to be made.13 The 5 criteria include:
When determining treatment options, the provider should consider that 2 classes of celiac disease exist: potential (or silent or seronegative) CD and refractory (or complicated) CD. Potential, silent, or seronegative CD patients will all benefit from a gluten-free diet (GFD). The GFD not only helps alleviate symptoms related to malabsorption such as diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss, but also has other positive effects. Research studies have shown that after a year of following a GFD, there is a significant improvement in bone mineral density.15 In pediatric patients, adhering to a GFD for 2 years leads to average growth in height and weight, with some experiencing substantial catch-up growth.16 Additionally, when comparing the effectiveness of a GFD between patients with mild enteropathy and those with villous atrophy, it appears to yield similar outcomes in terms of mucosal architecture recovery, reduction of intestinal inflammation, antibody levels, and symptom relief. 17 A GFD has also been shown to assist mucosal healing and is even associated with decreased risk for cardiovascular disease.18
Treatment for individuals with refractory or complicated CD becomes more challenging. Refractory CD occurs when an individual continues to experience symptoms and villous atrophy after a year of adherence to a GFD. The recommendations for first-line treatment of refractory CD are systemic steroids in consultation with a specialist.13 Budesonide is another medication that has been shown to be helpful in the treatment of CD, while infliximab may be the preferred biological therapy for second-line treatment of refractory CD.13
The relationship between DCM and CD appears unlikely; however, Curione et al performed a study in an effort to determine the prevalence of these conditions coexisting. In a cohort of 52 patients diagnosed with idiopathic DCM, 3 patients also had CD. The researchers then compared this prevalence rate to the rate in the general population and found a significant prevalence of CD in individuals with DCM.14 Another study evaluated 642 patients with heart failure in need of a transplant. It was discovered that 12 out of 642 heart failure patients were positive with the endomysial antibody, indicating CD. In comparison, only 34 out of 9720 healthy control patients were positive for the endomysial antibody. These results reveal a greater occurrence of the endomysial antibody typically found within CD when compared to the general population.14
Celiac disease seropositivity in correlation with DCM was also explored in an Iranian study using 123 patients diagnosed with DCM. Of the 123 patients, 12 were found to have CD seropositivity, representing a higher prevalence than among the general population of Iran. It was also discovered that these 12 patients all had decreased ejection fractions when compared to the remaining 111 patients within the study.12 In a case report conducted by Salma Elnour, a 33-year-old Ethiopian woman presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue and dyspnea upon exertion. Electrocardiogram results showed a left bundle branch block and signs of left ventricular dilation and dysfunction indicative of DCM. Further immunoglobulin testing and duodenal biopsy showed results and pathologies consistent with CD.2
With this prevalence of DCM and CD, 3 proposed theories explain the relationship between these diseases. The first states that severe nutritional deficiencies seen as a result of CD will cause cardiomyopathies.2 Nutritional deficiencies like iodine deficiency; iron deficiency anemia; chronic malabsorption of vitamins, minerals, proteins and dietary fiber; and micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin D, vitamin B12 and folate all could play roles in this theory. In particular, iodine deficiency and iron deficiency anemia can contribute to thyroid disorders and blood dyscrasias respectively, which are known etiologies of DCM.19,20
The second theory states that infectious agents may be more readily absorbed within the GI tract in patients with celiac disease, resulting in an increased risk of myocardial damage.2 The third theory states that direct myocardial injury may result from an immune response against an antigen present in both the myocardium and the small intestine.2
Although current research has not provided insight into the specific etiology of DCM induced by CD, data are available on the impact of a GFD within this specific population. In the case of the 33-year-old Ethiopian woman, the patient was placed on an appropriate medication regimen and was heavily educated on the importance and benefits of a GFD.2 In a case reported by Curione, the cardiovascular effects of a GFD were observed in 3 patients. One patient did not follow a GFD treatment plan while 2 did. The patient who did not follow the diet program displayed a progression of DCM symptoms, while the other 2 patients had no progression of symptoms and even had minor left ventricular improvements on echocardiogram.21
Although larger studies specifically evaluating the impact of a GFD on CD patients with DCM still must be conducted, a study by Frustaci et al involving 187 patients with myocarditis has shown interesting results. Of the 187 patients, 9 patients had a diagnosis of CD.22 Five patients had myocarditis associated with heart failure and 4 patients presented with ventricular dysrhythmias.22 Following the initiation of a GFD, improvements in left ventricular size, cardiac function, and ejection fraction were observed in the 5 heart-failure patients.22 In the 4 ventricular dysrhythmia patients, a GFD showed an improvement of the arrhythmias from Lown class III-IVa to class I.22 Although the study by Frustaci et al was not specific to DCM, adherence to a GFD results in a multitude of cardiac benefits that would all positively impact a CD patient with DCM.
The association between DCM and CD is a relatively new area of inquiry within the medical field. Although the correlation may seem unlikely, studies have demonstrated that its prevalence is significant, and that these patients have decreased ejection fractions, which can lead to a more severe prognosis. Fortunately, initial studies show that adhering to a GFD have promising cardiac effects; however, more research must be conducted. Dilated cardiomyopathy associated with CD is a life-threatening condition if misdiagnosed or left untreated. Clinicians should be aware and informed about DCM, CD, and their association in order to appropriately identify and treat these complicated, connected diseases.","Brantley Holyfield, PA-S; Tyger Meade Clayton, MPA, PA-C"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/amy-haller-elevating-apps/,"Amy L. Haller, MBA, MPAS, PA-C: Elevating APPs in Pennsylvania and Across the Nation: Q&A","In this month’s PA profile, we feature Amy L. Haller, MBA, MPAS, PA-C, Co-Director of the UPMC and University of Pittsburgh Advanced Practice Provider (APP) Leadership Course in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. PA Haller leads key strategic continuing education programming for the University of Pittsburgh’s Department of Physician Assistant Studies. Additionally, she maintains an active clinical practice in general surgery and holds Adjunct Faculty appointments at Duquesne University and the University of Pittsburgh Physician Assistant Programs.
PA Haller: My journey towards becoming a PA was shaped by various experiences, but one pivotal moment was during my time at Duquesne University when we gained a new faculty member who was very involved in PA leadership in our state and national organizations. Witnessing her impact on paving the path forward of our profession had a profound impact on me and inspired me to pursue a career where I could make a difference in health care leadership.
PA Haller: The recognition of the growing need for specialized training and leadership development among APPs was ultimately what led me to create the UPMC + Pitt APP Certificate Course. Through my experiences working in health care, I observed a lack of formalized education programs tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities faced by APPs entering health care leadership. This motivated me to collaborate with industry experts and academic institutions to design a comprehensive course that addresses the evolving demands of the health care landscape and empowers APPs to excel as leaders in their field.
PA Haller: I have been actively involved in DEI initiatives aimed at promoting a culture of belonging and equality. For example, I was very intentional in the creation of the APP Leadership Course, in collaboration with a national APP leader in this space, to weave key DEI principles and learning activities into the course. These efforts are essential for fostering a supportive and inclusive environment where all individuals feel valued and respected.
PA Haller: My advice would be to embrace every opportunity for learning and growth. Seek out diverse clinical experiences, be open to feedback, and never stop expanding your knowledge base. Additionally, prioritize self-care and maintain a healthy work-life balance to avoid burnout and sustain your passion for patient care throughout your career.
PA Haller: One valuable lesson is the importance of collaboration and interdisciplinary teamwork. Health care is inherently multidisciplinary and effective collaboration between health care providers is essential for delivering high-quality patient care. Building strong relationships with colleagues from different disciplines and fostering open communication are key to achieving positive patient outcomes.
PA Haller: I prioritize self-care and incorporate activities that bring joy and relaxation into my routine. This includes regular exercise, spending time with loved ones, and engaging in hobbies such as tennis and golf. Additionally, I make it a point to set boundaries and practice mindfulness to maintain balance in both my personal and professional life. My greatest joy in life is spending time with my husband, Ed, and children Henry and Ivy, ages 6 and 3, respectively.
PA Haller: Looking back, one thing I wish I knew coming out of PA school is the importance of networking and building professional relationships early in my career. Building a strong professional network not only provides valuable support and mentorship but also opens doors to new opportunities for growth and advancement. Investing time in networking and cultivating meaningful connections within the health care community can have a significant impact on your career trajectory.",Jeanelle Jacobs
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/blood-based-noninvasive-liver-disease-hepatic-fibrosis-steatosis-guideline-aasld/,Blood-Based Noninvasive Liver Disease Assessment of Hepatic Fibrosis and Steatosis: A Guideline From the AASLD,"The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) has published a new practice guideline on the use of blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. The report was published in Hepatology.
The guideline is intended for adult and pediatric health care providers who manage patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) and was written by a panel of experts in adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology.
The guideline writing group developed guidance statements and conducted a systematic review of studies on blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA) through April 2022 to address clinical questions using the patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) approach. Recommendations were graded following the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment Development, and Evaluation system.
Multiple available fibrosis staging systems were incorporated into 1 system and classified as at least significant fibrosis (equivalent to at least fibrosis stage 2 or F2-4), at least advanced fibrosis (F3-4), and cirrhosis (F4). The guideline includes 10 guidance statements pertaining to 6 PICO questions.
PICO 1: Among adults with CLD, including hepatocellular or cholestatic disorders, are blood-based biomarker panels accurate for hepatic fibrosis staging, using histopathology as the reference?
The guideline writing group provided 3 guidance statements related to PICO 1. In the first statement, simple blood-based NILDA, such as aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) or Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4), was recommended as an initial test to detect significant fibrosis (F2-4), advanced fibrosis (F3-4), or cirrhosis (F4) compared with no test in adults with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) who are undergoing fibrosis staging before antiviral therapy (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).
In guidance statement #2, the AASLD recommended that simple blood-based NILDA tests, such as FIB-4, be used to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) vs no test for adults with NAFLD who are undergoing fibrosis staging (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).
As explained in guidance statement #3, evidence is insufficient to recommend blood-based NILDA for staging fibrosis in adults with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) or chronic cholestatic liver disease undergoing fibrosis staging (ungraded statement).
According to the writing group, blood-based biomarkers have a high sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for ruling out advanced fibrosis among patients with NAFLD, but they have a low positive predictive value (PPV) to rule in advanced fibrosis in low prevalence populations. No validated blood-based biomarker thresholds are available that are associated with fibrosis stage after sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients with HCV.
Because of the availability of direct-acting antiviral therapies with high efficacy for HCV, excluding stage F0-1 before treatment is less clinically relevant than detecting significant fibrosis (F3-4) or cirrhosis, according to the writing group. Research has shown that blood-based NILDA tests had moderate diagnostic use in detecting F2-4 and F4 in patients with HCV. Other evidence indicates that the use of thresholds for HCV may result in higher false-negative rates for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in HBV. For NAFLD advanced fibrosis, simple and complex blood-based marker algorithms have acceptable diagnostic accuracy in higher prevalence tertiary center cohorts. In patients with ALD and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, high accuracy has been reported for the FibroTest, FibroMeter, HepaScore, and ELF for cirrhosis.
PICO 2: For adults with CLD, including hepatocellular or cholestatic disorders, is any blood-based biomarker panel superior to another blood-based biomarker panel for hepatic fibrosis staging, using histopathology as the reference?
The writing group provided 2 guidance statements for PICO 2. In overall statement #4, the AASLD recommended simple, less costly, and readily available blood-based NILDA, such as FIB-4 vs complex proprietary tests for patients with chronic HCV who require fibrosis staging (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In statement #5, the writing group recommended simple, less costly, and readily available blood-based NILDA tests, such as FIB-4 or NAFLD fibrosis score vs complex proprietary tests to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) in patients with NAFLD who require fibrosis staging (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).
Studies with head-to-head comparisons of blood-based NILDA in the same cohort are limited, and pooling of sensitivity and specificity may be suboptimal, owing to the different thresholds used, according to the writing group. Also, other assessments such as predictive values should take into account the clinical setting and prevalence of different fibrosis stages in the specific population.
“The diagnostic performance of proprietary and nonproprietary tests is not significantly different in clinical practice,” the group stated. “Although proprietary markers may be suitable in select situations, nonproprietary tests are readily available, repeatable, and less expensive than proprietary tests.”
Among patients with HCV, proprietary and nonproprietary blood markers have demonstrated similar diagnostic accuracy for significant fibrosis, with comparative data mostly limited to APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest. For HBV, APRI and FIB-4 cutoffs may not be applicable in all populations, and misclassification may occur, especially with current cutoffs. In NAFLD, nonproprietary test scores have been comparable for excluding advanced fibrosis, although some studies found that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS) and FIB-4 may have better performance. Among patients with HCV/HIV co-infection, research has shown that the sensitivities and specificities of APRI, FIB-4, and FibroTest were comparable for significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.
PICO 3: In adults with CLD, including hepatocellular or cholestatic disorders, are 2 blood-based biomarker panels superior to 1 panel for staging fibrosis, using histopathology as the reference?
In guidance statement #6, the AASLD suggested that a sequential combination of blood-based markers may be better than 1 biomarker for F2-4 or F4 in patients with chronic untreated HCV (ungraded statement). In statement #7, among patients with NAFLD, the writing group suggested that the sequential combination of blood-based NILDA may be considered in diagnosing patients with advanced fibrosis (F3-4) vs 1 test alone (ungraded statement).
“Because simple single blood-based NILDA such as APRI, FIB-4, and NFS with upper and lower cutoffs frequently have indeterminate results, adding a second blood-based test may help to better classify patients according to fibrosis severity,” the writing group noted.
To detect patients with NAFLD advanced fibrosis, the AASLD recommended a sequential approach with FIB-4 as well as imaging NILDA or enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) in FIB-4 1.3 or higher when available.
Research has shown that among patients with HCV, diagnostic accuracy was greater for detecting significant fibrosis F2-F4 and cirrhosis F4 compared with either test alone. Other research found that the combination of FIB-4 and ELF was not associated with improved diagnostic accuracy vs FIB-4 alone using sequential analysis in NAFLD.
PICO 4: In adults with CLD, including hepatocellular or cholestatic disorders, can serial blood-based biomarker panels accurately predict the natural history of progression or regression of fibrosis in response to treatment relative to serial histopathology?
In guidance statement #8, the guideline suggested against using blood-based NILDA tests to follow progression, stability, or regression in the histologic stage (by biopsy) in patients with CLD (ungraded statement).
Most studies reporting fibrosis regression and/or cirrhosis have involved large cohorts of patients with HBV or HCV after antiviral therapy. Increasing evidence has been shown regarding the reversibility of fibrosis in NAFLD, although longitudinal histologic data with blood-based biomarkers are lacking for other liver diseases.
“One of the major limitations of currently available blood-based biomarkers is that they often misclassify patients with intermediate stages of fibrosis and are not able to differentiate adjacent stage disease,” the writing group stated. “Importantly, extracellular matrix deposition and degradation is not a linear process and varies based on disease etiology.”
PICO 5: For patients with NAFLD, are blood-based biomarker panels accurate for grading hepatic steatosis with histopathology or magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy (MRS) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–proton density fat fraction (PDFF) as the reference?
As guidance statement #9, the AASLD suggested against using blood-based NILDA for detecting steatosis in patients with NAFLD (ungraded statement).
Controlled attenuated parameter and MRI may accurately quantify steatosis degree, and MRI-PDFF and MRS have a strong association with histology to detect and grade steatosis and may be used as reference standards in adults with CLD, the writing group noted. Data are insufficient to recommend blood tests as clinical endpoints for monitoring changes in steatosis independent of fibrosis over time or to recommend a specific blood-based test or algorithm to use along with imaging-based testing in assessing steatosis, according to the group.
“Because body mass index is included in many of the indices, caution is necessary when using NILDA to assess steatosis in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery,” the group stated.
PICO 6: For pediatric chronic liver disease, are blood-based biomarkers accurate for hepatic fibrosis staging, with histopathology as the reference?
As guidance statement #10, the guideline suggested using simple, cost-effective, and readily available blood-based NILDA, including APRI or FIB-4, to detect advanced fibrosis (F3-4) among pediatric patients with CLD (ungraded statement). The writing group noted that some blood-based NILDA in children are accurate for detecting advanced fibrosis but may not always discriminate among earlier fibrosis stages. In addition, FIB-4 is not as accurate in children vs adults, especially in very young children, and fast growth in children and changes in alkaline phosphatase may confound interpretating blood or collagen-based NILDA tests in pediatric liver disease, according to the writing group.
“In the pediatric population with CLD, there is growing but insufficient evidence to recommend blood-based NILDA as endpoints to monitor changes in fibrosis over time,” the group stated.
Evidence is mixed for use of APRI to assess or predict liver fibrosis in biliary atresia. Research in children with CFLD who had dual-pass liver biopsy and matched children without CFLD found that APRI and FIB-4 identified those with CFLD and provided information about severity of fibrosis.
“APRI and FIB-4 have been the most studied NILDA tests in children, but there is still insufficient evidence to recommend blood biomarkers as endpoints to monitor changes in fibrosis over time,” the group stated. “Any blood-based NILDA that includes age should be used cautiously in children.”
The guideline also includes an algorithm created by the AASLD NILDA Writing Group for clinicians to use as a readily available and simple decision support tool. The group recommended that fibrosis staging be initiated with simple blood-based NILDA, including nonproprietary tests. Among the 3 main nonproprietary NILDA (FIB-4, APRI, and NFS in NAFLD), FIB-4 may have superior performance, especially in detecting F3-4 stages of fibrosis, the group noted. NFS may be an equivalent to FIB-4 in patients with NAFLD for evaluating advanced fibrosis, and the writing group recommended use of imaging-based NILDA to identify steatotic liver disease.
The use of high-throughput technologies in experimental models will continue to generate novel disease and injury-specific, blood-based biomarkers for fibrosis assessment, according to the AASLD writing group.
“Selection and validation of candidate biomarkers for fibrosis assessment from these multi-omics databases will be challenging,” the group stated. “Progress in this field requires a paradigm shift from using a static and semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis as the reference standard, towards developing dynamic disease-specific models of clinical relevance that are associated with outcomes.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/early-onset-colorectal-cancer-examining-risk-factors-increased-incidence/,Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer: Examining Risk Factors & Increased Incidence,"Between 1990-2019, the global incidence of early-onset cancer soared by 79.1% and the mortality rate spiked by 27.7%. Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) showed one of the highest mortality rates and disability-adjusted life years during that span.1 A 2023 study in Cancers concluded that cases of EOCRC will more than double by 2030.2
It is widely accepted that early-onset colorectal cancer is becoming more common but the reasons behind it remain somewhat unclear. Recent findings published in Annals of Oncology provided insights into what’s driving the increase and how clinicians can help their patients reduce their risk.3
In an effort to understand what’s behind the increased incidence of EOCRC, a team of investigators conducted a genome-wide association and Mendelian randomization analysis. They examined over 6000 EOCRC cases and upwards of 65,000 controls from databases including Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and UK Biobank. They examined 28 modifiable risk factors—including body size traits, diet and lifestyle traits, inflammatory and growth factors, and glycemic traits—using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR).
The investigators pinpointed a pair of novel risk loci at 1p34.1 and 4p15.33 that had not previously been associated with colorectal cancer, along with 10 previously known risk loci. They also identified specific gene changes that might make individuals more susceptible to EOCRC. Namely, the MUTYH gene variant (rs36053993, G396D) was linked to an increased risk for the condition.
The researchers dismissed the notion that these newly identified genes might explain an uptick in early-onset colorectal cancer, however. “Genes do not change that quickly,” Ulrike Peters, PhD, MPH noted in a Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center news release. “We knew there must be environmental and lifestyle factors that explain the increase.”4
In their analysis, the researchers found evidence that body size and metabolic factors—such as body fat percentage, basal metabolic rate, and waist circumference—were linked to a heightened risk for early-onset colorectal cancer. They also identified lifestyle and environmental factors such as increased alcohol consumption and lower education levels.
The investigators suggested their findings might be used to help lower risk for patients. “It’s important to see that alcohol and obesity are linked to early-onset colorectal cancer,” noted Peters. “Also, insulin signaling and infection-related biological pathways. These are all really important to understand—it’s helping us to develop interventions.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offered similar guidance, a year before the study’s release. Cautioning that research is underway into how diet might affect colorectal cancer risk, they noted that medical experts generally agree a diet low in animal fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is likely to reduce risk. They also encouraged physical activity, limiting alcohol consumption, and avoiding tobacco.5
In addition, the CDC recommends routine screening beginning at age 45. They note that almost all colorectal cancers start as abnormal growths in the colon or rectum, which can be present for years before invasive cancer develops even without symptoms.
Given these findings, clinicians should continue to encourage their patients to undergo routine check-ups and maintain healthy lifestyles.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/better-listening-to-my-patients/,How Could I Have Been Better at Listening to My Patients?,"I’ve been a physician associate (PA) since 2000. I practiced clinically until September 2023, when I moved to an academic faculty position. I am still a proud PA-C, but my practice is now more focused on helping students in my program find clinical placements, which is sometimes challenging.
I’ve been reflecting on how, over the almost 24 years of entirely clinical practice, I did as a listener. How did I do as a conduit for my patients to obtain quality care? What could I have done better, and what can I do better should I return to clinical practice?
These are tough questions to answer, and ones that can lead to defensiveness and denial. I have recently been framing this self-exploration by looking back at my family dynamics; “family of origin” issues as the counselors say.
My father and mother were both highly trained educators, focused on the teaching profession. They both seemed to have strong listening skills, much to my appreciation; although there were times when they struggled as parents to listen fully to me or my brother. Certainly, the parent-child relationship brings challenges apart from those that face medical patients and medical providers, but I am convinced there is much to learn from both, with application to both.
My parents’ biggest challenges were finding the knowledge, skills, and abilities to guide me through the call to listening that arose most acutely during my adolescent years. We all had pretty smooth sailing regarding listening to each other in earlier years, and I credit them for that, mostly because of their interest and willingness to put our family into settings that taxed our empathy and active listening skills. Their choice to put my brother and I into completely foreign and new-stress settings (moving from a small town in Oregon to Libya for a year in 1962, where my father was a principal of a high school on an American Air Force Base, then moving from Eastern Washington to Hawaii in my 10th grade year).
The biggest test for our mutual listening skills occurred during my 8th and 9th grade school years in Eastern Washington. Until then I felt I was holding up my part of the deal. We all spoke freely and warmly to each other, had lots of meaningful time together, and there was a general sense of mutual respect, openness, and honesty, with things apparently functioning smoothly.
Then in my 9th grade year, as I began to explore issues and relationships new to me and to them, we struggled. I recall the dread when my father would come to my room, in his suit and tie from his work, and ask if he could speak to me in my parents’ bedroom. There, he would tell me that he had heard from some of my unnamed friends and schoolteachers about some unacceptable behavior on my part related to school and peri-school activities. My father, in these meetings, was calm and would sit in a chair, with me sitting on his bed. Even then, I felt this was setting us up as less than equal, and I didn’t like it.
He asked me to explain myself, and I would defensively offer my story, trying to help him understand that there was nothing untoward in my behavior for him to be concerned about. I wasn’t drinking, smoking, using drugs, having inappropriate relationships with friends or classmates, but he was stubborn in his interpretation of my assertions. I was no angel, but I thought I was being a pretty responsible child.
This was frustrating to me, and I struggled to get him to shift his thinking. Finally, I pleaded with him, “Dad, I don’t think you are hearing me, can we change seats, can you sit on the bed, and allow me to sit in the comfortable chair?” He thought that was a little weird, but we did that.
Now in a more equitable-feeling position, I asked him, “please try to hear me.” He quietly nodded and agreed, and I made my case. In the chair, I was more comfortable gesturing, using my hands to make points, and even asking him questions.
There was a notable shift in his stance on the interrogation. He listened more, talked less, asked respectful questions, and restated my position in ways that were accurate and self-assuring. He allowed there to be moments of silence in the conversation, and I felt deeply heard.
After several minutes of this shifted dynamic, I asked him, “so can you believe me now? Can you understand why I would do nothing to harm your trust?” He nodded, and said “yes, and thank you for your effort here for us to hear each other.” We shook hands, and I left the room.
Now, when I think of this encounter, I examine my own listening malfunctions as a clinical PA for so many years. While I prided myself in being an active listener, in my work in addiction medicine I recall patients who were frustrated with me, and who felt I wasn’t listening to them, or even allowing them to speak.
As I think back to those patients, I remember my own devotion to trying to control the encounter, thinking that it was my job as the clinician to do so, and maintain control. I was now the one sitting in the comfortable chair calling the shots, and in doing so, I now see how I likely short-changed many of my patients over the 23 years of clinical behavioral health practice.
I wish I had some of the clinical encounters to do over. And to any patient who I have not fully grasped my responsibility to listen and hear, I wish I could see you to apologize. I hope that if I’m lucky enough to have another crack at clinical practice, that I can carry the lessons from above to my care for them. They all deserve at least that.","Jim Anderson, MPAS, PA-C, DFAAPA"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/dr-tyra-bryant-stephens-tackles-asthma-disparities/,"Tyra Bryant-Stephens, MD, Pioneers Novel Approach to Tackling Asthma Disparities: Q&A","In celebration of Asthma and Allergy Awareness Month, this physician profile spotlights Tyra Bryant-Stephens, MD, a pediatrician specializing in asthma who was the featured speaker at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) Diversity Forum during the 2024 ATS International Conference, held from May 19 to 22 in San Diego, California.
Dr Bryant-Stephens, Chief Health Equity Officer and a practicing physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), is nationally recognized for her community-driven, evidence-based research on asthma and environmental asthma triggers. In 1997, she founded the Community Asthma Prevention Program (CAPP) at CHOP. This community outreach program offers community- and school-based asthma education and environmental mitigation and has delivered more than 21,000 home-based asthma visits to families in underserved, poorly resourced, inner-city areas. The program has since become involved in identifying and funding necessary home repairs to reduce asthma triggers, which has led to a reduction in hospitalizations among at-risk children with asthma.
Dr Bryant-Stephens: I started out in a rural community in the South. My grandma was the community nurse. She was a licensed practical nurse and really served mostly the Black neighborhoods in this small community. She didn’t drive; she walked to people’s homes with a wagon that had all of her stuff on it. She would get a message that someone was sick, asking if she could come by, and she’d go there. Most of us [in the community] only went to the doctor for shots and broken bones, because she really was the healer of the community. I would follow her around and ask her questions like: why are you doing this or that? I really appreciated how she could make people feel better. I wanted to be a nurse like her.
Then in 10th grade, in a summer program for gifted students, I was asked what I wanted to do [after high school]. When I said I wanted to be a nurse, someone asked me: Did you ever think about being a doctor? And I thought: Are there Black doctors? I never knew that was an option! From that day on, I realized I could be a doctor, and that’s the road I went down, not knowing anything about what that road would look like.
Dr Bryant-Stephens: That goes back to my first year of residency. The first child I saw in the emergency room (ER) had an asthma attack. I was impressed that after being so sick when she came in, she left able to breathe and talk normally. That really sparked my interest. I wanted to know: What causes an asthma attack? And, if you can so easily reverse an asthma attack, can you prevent them? That’s what got me started with thinking about asthma.
Once I became a doctor, I saw asthma all the time. As we know, primary care doctors take care of 80% of the children with asthma.
Dr Bryant-Stephens: As medical director of the first off-site primary care center at CHOP, every Monday morning I would get a weekly report of the children who went to the emergency room, and there were always children with asthma. I thought: We do everything we know to do, according to the guidelines, in caring for kids with asthma, but our kids still end up in the hospital ER.
I realized that we were missing something. I saw that we need to go into the community and figure out what we were doing wrong and learn what gaps needed to be filled.
We started out with classes at a community site. We facilitated a very interactive program of 5 sessions on the ins and outs of asthma. During the second session, an environmental class, I kept hearing parents say they didn’t have the tools needed to do the mitigation strategies we were discussing. That’s what started my research career: I wanted to determine if having community health workers in homes providing one-on-one education, showing parents how to do the mitigation strategies, could make a difference.The Community Asthma Prevention Program at CHOP now gives parents greater support for dealing with common asthma triggers, including dust, cockroaches mice, pets, tobacco smoke, and mold. For dust mitigation, we give parents mattresses, pillow covers, and vinyl tiles they can use to replace carpeting. They have to do the work, but we give them materials. For pest management, we give them cockroach and mice pest prevention cleaning strategies, but we also give them traps and things like that. Through a partnership with the health department, we are now able to bring in professionals to do integrated pest management as well. We also show folks how to do better job with cleaning strategies to keep out mice, which is the most common pest that we see in the homes. Mold and mildew are harder, because usually you don’t get mold until you have a serious leak. But we teach cleaning strategies and we point out plumbing leaks that need to be fixed.
In 2018, CAPP started doing some structural home repairs. We now do roof repairs, plumbing repairs, all kinds of structural repairs to reduce asthma triggers in the home. We’ve now completed 200 home repairs. To my knowledge, there aren’t any other programs that are really doing the structural things like we do. Our hospital invests about $15,000 per home, so it’s a big deal in terms of the investment we’re making in these houses.The CAPP program’s community education classes and one-on-one in-home education have shown measurable results that have been published. Obviously, with our more recent home repair initiative, it takes a while to see results; it’s not like giving people medicine, where you expect to see results right away. At this point we have seen a reduction of about 30% in hospitalizations among those who have received the home repairs.
Dr Bryant-Stephens: We got started through a grant, and we had matching funds from the hospital through CHOP’s Healthier Together initiative. Partnering with a Philadelphia home repair agency, we started with repairing 30 homes to really see if this was feasible and if it was worth it. Once we were able to show we could do the work and get results, CHOP starting fully supporting this work through philanthropy and community benefits dollars.
Dr Bryant-Stephens: As a Black person who grew up in the Black community, the whole idea that people had worse outcomes because they were Black just never resonated with me. I realized that we, in the medical field, were missing something, that there was some kind of gap that we needed to fill and I was motivated to find it. I knew the education and the office visits we had been offering didn’t seem to be working. We had to admit that people weren’t doing what we asked them to do, and we needed to find out why — what the barriers were.
Those community education classes were really the launching pad. Listening to people at those community education classes gave me the information I needed on the barriers, so we could begin figuring out solutions to address those barriers. That’s what really started the new program for improving people’s homes.
What keeps me motivated? Asthma hasn’t gone anywhere! Unfortunately, we still have [health] disparities! We know that we are able to change things for people in our programs, but how do we create systemic change? I don’t have enough dollars to enroll [all the children who need these programs]. So how do we create change or advocate for change to disseminate the practices that work, to help children throughout the city?The problem we are dealing with here is systemic. Systemic oppression, like redlining. So poor people, Black people, are living in these communities where there’s been no investment, with poor housing conditions with most houses built at the end of the 1800s or in the early 1900s. You can imagine what it takes for upkeep, to maintain them. But people don’t have the resources to maintain these homes — and the children living in these homes who go to the hospital [with asthma] are then sent back to these houses. If we really want to change things, we have to address the environment where these children with asthma are living.
Dr Bryant-Stephens: I’m now the Chief Health Equity Officer for the CHOP Center for Health Equity. Through this program, we try to discover, disseminate and implement best practices to reduce disparities and improve health equity and improve health outcomes for children. Our motto is “No harm and equitable care.” We’re hoping to do a lot. There are many aspects of children’s health where disparities are seen, so we try to support clinical teams in analyzing the problems and providing needed tools. We also partner with people in the community to help bring about change in health-related social needs — helping families obtain existing resources, identifying where more resources are needed, and working with partners to develop resources related to things like housing, food, financial stability, child care, and utilities.
Dr Bryant-Stephens: That the CAPP program is still here, and that we’ve been able to evolve over time, organically, by listening to folks. I don’t think we’ve reached everything that impacts asthma. But we’ve definitely made a dent in changing the things that make a difference in asthma outcomes. We’re still here trying to achieve equity for all kids with asthma. It shouldn’t be about their skin color, it should be about the fact that these are children who deserve healthy living situations, so they can have healthy lives.
Dr Bryant-Stephens: My overall vision is that children in Philadelphia be the healthiest children in the nation. Now that we’ve moved from the idea [that so many health-related problems] are rooted in race — now that people have recognized that race is a social construct, not a biological one — we need to think about those things that are barriers to all children reaching their best health. Maybe all children can’t be equally healthy, but they can all be at their best health. That’s the lofty goal that will keep me busy for years to come!
Dr Bryant-Stephens: Many of our clinical algorithms have been based on race. Let’s just talk about asthma and spirometry. Race was one of the predictors of lung function outcomes. If you look at the genesis of that, there wasn’t really a scientific reason for this; it was based on assumptions [maybe even going back to differences in] looking at slaves’ build vs White men’s build and assuming that Black people had less lung capacity. And if you assume that, then your prediction for how Black people perform on lung tests will be less than that of White people. In the last couple of years, the American Thoracic Society has discounted this and determined that race should not be part of the algorithm.
These underlying racist assumptions have affected other areas of medicine as well. I don’t think it’s helpful to call people racist, but racism has been the reason that it has been assumed that Black people are not physically as capable as other folks, and that has permeated our thinking. Now that we’ve all had an “aha” moment and realized that’s not true, I think we move forward. I think we now say all children — and it doesn’t matter the color of their skin, or how poor or how rich — should achieve their best health, their best outcomes. And we realize that might look different for different children, but not because of the color of their skin.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/people-displaced-by-natural-disasters-tell-a-story-of-vulnerability-and-recovery/,People Displaced by Natural Disasters Tell a Story of Vulnerability and Recovery,"The Conversation — People often think of disasters as great equalizers. After all, a tornado, wildfire, or hurricane doesn’t discriminate against those in its path. But the consequences for those affected are not “one-size-fits-all.”
That’s evident in recent storms, including deadly tornadoes over the 2024 Memorial Day weekend, and in the US Census Bureau’s national household surveys showing who was displaced by disasters in 2023.
Overall, the Census Bureau estimates that nearly 2.5 million Americans had to leave their homes because of disasters in 2023, whether for a short period or much longer. However, a closer look at demographics in the survey reveals much more about disaster risk in America and who is vulnerable.
It suggests, as researchers have also found, that people with the fewest resources, as well as those who have disabilities or have been marginalized, were more likely to be displaced from their homes by disasters than other people.
Decades of disaster research, including from our team at the University of Delaware’s Disaster Research Center, make at least 2 things crystal clear: First, people’s social circumstances – such as the resources available to them, how much they can rely on others for help, and challenges they face in their daily life – can lead them to experience disasters differently compared to others affected by the same event. And second, disasters exacerbate existing vulnerabilities.
This research also shows how disaster recovery is a social process. Recovery is not a “thing,” but rather it is linked to how we talk about recovery, make decisions about recovery, and prioritize some activities over others.
Sixty years ago, the recovery period after the destructive 1964 Alaskan earthquake was driven by a range of economic and political interests, not simply technical factors or needs. That kind of influence continues in disaster recovery today. Even disaster buyout programs can be based on economic considerations that burden under-resourced communities.
This recovery process is made even more difficult because policymakers often underappreciate the immense difficulties residents face during recovery.
Following Hurricane Katrina, sociologist Alexis Merdjanoff found that property ownership status affected psychological distress and displacement, with displaced renters showing higher levels of emotional distress than homeowners. Lack of autonomy in decisions about how to repair or rebuild can play a role, further highlighting disparate experiences during disaster recovery.
The 2023 census data consistently showed that socially vulnerable groups reported being displaced from their homes at higher rates than other groups.
People over 65 had a higher rate of being displaced than younger people. So did Hispanic and Black Americans, people with less than a high school education, and those with low household incomes or who were struggling with employment compared to other groups. While the Census Bureau describes the data as experimental and notes that some sample sizes are small, the differences stand out and are consistent with what researchers have found.
Low-income and marginalized communities are often in areas at higher risk of flooding from storms or may lack investment in storm protection measures.
The morass of bureaucracy and conflicting information can also be a barrier to a swift recovery.
After Hurricane Sandy, people in New Jersey complained about complex paperwork and what felt to them like ever-changing rules. They bemoaned their housing recovery as, in researchers’ words, a “muddled, inconsistent experience that lacked discernible rationale”.
Residents who don’t know how to find information about disaster recovery assistance or can’t take time away from work to accumulate the necessary documents and meet with agency representatives can have a harder time getting quick help from federal and state agencies.
Disabilities also affect displacement. Of those people who were displaced for some length of time in 2023, those with significant difficulty hearing, seeing, or walking reported being displaced at higher rates than those without disabilities.
Prolonged loss of electricity or water due to an ice storm, wildfire, or grid overload during a heat emergency can force those with medical conditions to leave even if their neighbors are able to stay.
That can also create challenges for their recovery. Displacement can leave vulnerable disaster survivors isolated from their usual support systems and health care providers. It can also isolate those with limited mobility from disaster assistance.
Crucial research efforts are underway to better help people who may be struggling the most after disasters.
For example, our center was part of an interdisciplinary team that developed a framework to predict community resilience after disasters and help identify investments that could be made to bolster resilience. It outlines ways to identify gaps in community functioning, like health care and transportation, before disaster strikes. And it helps determine recovery strategies that would have the most impact.
Shifts in weather and climate and a mobile population mean that people’s exposure to hazards are constantly shifting and often increasing. The Coastal Hazard, Equity, Economic Prosperity, and Resilience Hub, which our center is also part of, is developing tools to help communities best ensure resilience and strong economic conditions for all residents without shortchanging the need to prioritize equity and well-being.
We believe that when communities experience disasters, they should not have to choose between thriving economically, ensuring all residents can recover, and reducing risk of future threats. There must be a way to account for all three.
Understanding that disasters affect people in different ways is only a first step toward ensuring that the most vulnerable residents receive the support they need. Involving community members from disproportionately vulnerable groups to identify challenges is another. But those, alone, are not enough.
If we as a society care about those who contribute to our communities, we must find the political and organizational will to act to reduce the challenges reflected in the census and disaster research.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/clinical-case-study-atypical-presentation-and-management-of-latent-autoimmune-diabetes/,Clinical Case Study: Atypical Presentation and Management of Latent Autoimmune Diabetes,"A 41-year-old Hispanic woman presents to her worksite clinic for an evaluation of acute onset polyuria and polydipsia. She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes approximately 21 months earlier. The patient is overweight, with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, iron deficiency anemia, migraines, and chronic kidney disease with proteinuria.
At the time of the diabetes diagnosis, her glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level was 10.4% and non-fasting point-of-care blood glucose level was 399 mg/dL, with symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia.
The patient reports not taking metformin for the last week because she ran out of the medication. Her blood glucose level was 566 mg/dL and her HbA1c was 11.4%. The clinicians at her worksite clinic, which also serves as her primary care site, advise her to go to the emergency department (ED).
The patient visited 2 EDs over a 2-day period and chose to leave after 7 hours without evaluation. A comprehensive metabolic panel completed at the ED waiting room reveals that her electrolyte levels are within normal limits and her C-peptide is elevated (5.2 ng/mL), which is an expected result for a patient with hyperglycemia.  The patient has macroalbuminuria (creatinine level: 2265 mg/L), indicating chronic kidney disease. She has no symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or circulatory compromise. Thyroid stimulating hormone is within normal limits (Table 1).
In addition to metformin, the patient is taking atorvastatin, amlodipine, enalapril, ferrous sulfate, and vitamin B12. No findings consistent with target organ damage are detected. A complete blood count taken 4 days later was within normal levels. She was able to lower her glucose level at home with a combination of increased water intake, metformin, and glipizide tablets.
A sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (ertugliflozin) is added to her management plan several days after the episode when a random glucose was 202 mg/dL and she was asymptomatic. Follow-up laboratory testing reveals she is positive for glutamate decarboxylase antibody 65 (GAD65) autoantibody (0.04 nmol/L). This positive test reveals she has latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). Resumption of metformin at an increased dose and addition of the SGLT2 lowers her HbA1c to 7.6% in a 3-month period. The SGLT2 agent is difficult to obtain at this time due to supply shortages.
To ensure adequate control of her diabetes, the patient’s hemoglobin HbA1c is monitored every 3 months and medications are adjusted as needed (Table 2). She is responding well to her current oral agent regimen and may not require insulin at this time, as evidenced by adequate response of HbA1c and C-peptide values demonstrating she is not insulin-deficient.  Her last blood work reveals a reduced lipid profile: total cholesterol 145 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein 37 mg/dL, and low-density lipoprotein 80 mg/dL.
Patients with a diagnosis of diabetes are typically classified as type 1 or type 2. However, atypical presentations of diabetes, such as LADA, exist. Approximately 2% of patients with diabetes have etiologies other than type 1 or type 2, including gestational, cystic fibrosis–related, or as the result of certain medications.1 Historically, classification between type 1 and type 2 was based on patient presentation and initial laboratory findings of fasting blood sugar and HbA1c.
Clinicians often proceed to manage an older individual diagnosed with diabetes as if they have type 2 diabetes based on clinical presentation. However, an estimated 2% to 12% of people worldwide diagnosed with type 2 diabetes have LADA.2 Individuals diagnosed with LADA may have symptoms that mimic type 2 diabetes, yet have autoimmune markers that are characteristic of type 1 diabetes.3
The correct classification of LADA is crucial to guide pharmacologic management and ultimately reduce the risk of adverse events including delayed treatment, hospitalization due to ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic nonketotic coma, and progression of target organ damage.
An algorithm for guidelines and management of LADA was created by an international expert panel in October of 2020 made up of members from both the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes.2 The following criteria must be met for a diagnosis of LADA:  patient older than 30 years, a positive GAD65 antibody test, low fasting C-peptide levels, and no treatment with oral insulin for at least 6 months after diagnosis.3-5 While more women than men are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, LADA is diagnosed more often in men. One study found the diagnostic ratio of LADA to be 4:1 of men to women.3
Latent autoimmune diabetes does not have standardized guidelines for management and is usually treated as type 2 diabetes.6 Prior to identification of LADA, the patient in this case was managed with metformin and glipizide (a sulfonylurea) until she experienced a hypoglycemic episode from the sulfonylurea, which stimulates the release of insulin from beta cells. Sulfonylureas are not recommended as a treatment for LADA and may hasten the decline of C-peptide levels, leading to premature utilization of insulin.6
Patient with LADA progress to reliance on insulin on a much slower course than patients with type 1 diabetes. The presence of metabolic syndrome is significantly more likely to be present in those with type 2 diabetes than in patients diagnosed with LADA or type 1 diabetes.7 This patient in this case was overweight and had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are all consistent with metabolic syndrome. She also had GAD65 autoantibodies present. Although she does not possess all characteristics typical of LADA identified by the American Diabetes Association, routine testing available at a nurse-led worksite clinic made identification of this diagnosis possible.
According to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) guidelines, this patient could be started on insulin, as her HbA1c was higher than 10% on 2 separate occasions.6 Several barriers to insulin initiation can be identified in this case.8 First, the patient’s time and ability to follow up in the clinic are limited. Her availability is greatly impacted by her work schedule. She works 6 to 7 days per week, and has historically made several clinic visits on her solitary day off.  Although she has medical insurance through her employer, the time she may have to visit with a diabetic educator is significantly limited. In addition, these visits would require a copay, while visits to her worksite clinic are not associated with any cost.
Second, there have been instances of non-adherence to oral therapies. If non-adherence issues and barriers that the patient faced regarding this regimen could be addressed through therapeutic communication, there would be a possibility of delaying initiation of insulin.
Third, resistance to the initiation of insulin is a challenge in primary care. Up to a third of insulin-naïve patients who are prescribed a basal regimen may not be adherent.8 Continuation of condition management with oral therapy with HbA1c monitoring every 3 months allows clinical staff to adjust medical management when necessary, while extending the patient-provider relationship.
Delay of insulin initiation may have been supported by the eventual addition of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist to the patient’s treatment regimen, although large-scale research is needed to demonstrate the impact of GLP-1 therapy on the preservation of endogenous insulin production.2 A GLP-1 agonist, semaglutide, was selected for glycemic management and potential reduction of BMI.
Treatment with oral antihyperglycemics may be delayed approximately 6 months after diagnosis because LADA is a slowly progressing form of type 1 diabetes. However, this is highly individualized and insulin deficiency may occur sooner. Within the first 3 years of diagnosis, 30% to 40% of these misdiagnosed patients will have insulin incorporated into their plan of care.2,4 When treating individuals with LADA as if they had type 2 diabetes with oral medications, there is an increased risk of an escalated destruction of beta cells.9 To avoid this, once there is a suspicion or confirmation of LADA, incorporating insulin into pharmacologic management is recommended to preserve remaining beta cells.9
If there remains a question regarding the individual’s diagnosis, the serum insulin concentration can be obtained by a C-peptide level. If there is an absolute insulin deficiency (undetectable C-peptide), the person is considered to have type 1 diabetes.9 Persons with LADA generally present with low, yet detectable, C-peptide levels.9 This can be a helpful distinguishing factor, but is not useful 3 to 5 years after a diabetes diagnosis.2 While additional autoimmune laboratory markers, such as islet cell cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ICA), islet antigen 2 (IA-2), and insulin autoantibodies (IAA), may also be positive in LADA, the high cost of these laboratory tests is a barrier and they are often not ordered.5
This diagnosis has implications for treatment choices that may be urgent in nature to avoid deteriorating clinical status due to insulinopenia, and the possibility of concurrent or future autoimmune conditions.
Through the trajectory of treatment, this patient’s HbA1c level fluctuated unexpectedly. Although more long-term monitoring will be needed, she appears to have a gradual insulin deficiency. Her diabetes is currently well-managed as evidenced by an HbA1c less than 7%; however, if her HbA1c begins to increase while on oral antihyperglycemics, incorporating insulin will need to be considered.","Sheila Leen, MSN, RN, APN-BC; Sydney Junion, DNP, RN; Martha Siomos, DNP, MSN, ADM-BC, FNP-BC"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/alcohol-use-disorder-medications/,Alcohol Use Disorder Can Be Treated With an Array of Medications,"The Conversation — More than 29.5 million Americans ages 12 and up had alcohol use disorder – the medical term for the disease commonly known as alcoholism – in 2022, when the most recent national data was published.
The condition is characterized by a pattern of heavy alcohol consumption with loss of control over drinking despite negative social, occupational, or health consequences.
Deaths from excessive alcohol use have sharply increased in recent years, to 178,000 in the United States in 2021, up from 138,000 5 years earlier. The greatest increase occurred during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Alcohol is responsible for more deaths than overdoses from opioids and all other substances combined, and it accounts for 1 in 5 of all deaths of people ages 20 to 49. Alcohol-associated deaths occur from a variety of causes. These include alcohol’s long-term effects such as cancer, liver disease, and heart disease as well as its short-term effects such as motor vehicle accidents, poisoning, and suicide.
Many effective treatments exist for alcohol use disorder, including psychotherapy, peer support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and SMART Recovery, and medications. I’m a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist, and for the past 15 years, my research has focused on evaluating medications for alcohol use disorder.
Over that time, I have seen substantial changes in the scientific understanding and treatment of alcohol use disorder. I am optimistic that our existing medications can reach more people with this condition, that we can better target these medications to the patients most likely to benefit from them, and that new effective medications are on the horizon.
With the onset of the opioid epidemic in the past 2 decades, medications for opioid use disorder, such as methadone and buprenorphine, have entered the public consciousness. However, medications for alcohol use disorder are less familiar to the public and used less frequently.
While 22% of patients with opioid use disorder receive medications to treat it, the rate of medication treatment for alcohol use disorder is much lower. Less than 10% of people with alcohol use disorder receive any treatment in any year, and less than 3% receive medications for it.
Regrettably, many people with alcohol use disorder don’t recognize the severity of their drinking and its effects on others, and many do not realize that effective medications are available.
As of May 2024, 3 medications have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of alcohol use disorder. The oldest and best known of these medications is disulfiram – sold under the brand name Antabuse – a compound that was first used in the American rubber industry.
In 1937, a rubber plant physician observed that workers exposed to disulfiram displayed adverse reactions to alcohol, including nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia – meaning fast heart rate. Subsequent research determined that disulfiram inhibits alcohol metabolism, leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde. This causes many of the symptoms of a hangover immediately after alcohol ingestion, making drinking unpleasant.
Disulfiram is effective for reducing drinking but must be taken daily by mouth, which limits its utility if patients do not take it on this schedule.
A more recently FDA-approved – and more effective – medication for alcohol use disorder is the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone. It blocks opioid receptors and prevents opioids – both “exogenous” opioid drugs and “endogenous” opioids produced in the brain – from activating these receptors.
It might be surprising that an opioid receptor antagonist is effective for treating alcohol use disorder. But, in fact, opioids play a key role in alcohol’s effect on the neurotransmitter dopamine, which underlies the pleasurable effects of alcohol and most other drugs.
Naltrexone reduces dopamine release from alcohol, blocking some of the pleasurable effects of drinking. Importantly, it also reduces alcohol craving, likely through its effects on dopamine which is released in response to cues, such as the sight, smell, and taste of alcohol. Naltrexone is effective for reducing heavy drinking but less effective for complete abstinence from alcohol.
Naltrexone can be taken daily by mouth or injected once per month, making it a better option for patients who might struggle to take a daily oral medication. Interestingly, it also reduces heavy drinking when taken sporadically prior to anticipated drinking occasions. A similar opioid antagonist, nalmefene, is approved in the European Union for alcohol use disorder.
The third FDA-approved medication, acamprosate, also reduces alcohol cravings, but its molecular effects are less well understood. Results from European clinical trials have shown that it can help people reduce their drinking, but results from US trials have been less positive.
Several medications have demonstrated encouraging effects on drinking in randomized controlled trials but are not yet FDA-approved for alcohol use disorder. Instead, they are used “off-label,” meaning that physicians use their discretion to prescribe them for an unapproved indication. The most promising medications are approved for treating epilepsy.
These medications appear to be effective for alcohol use disorder in part by reducing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, a dangerous condition that develops among some people following the abrupt cessation of heavy drinking. In its most severe form, alcohol withdrawal causes hyperreactivity of the autonomic nervous system, auditory and visual hallucinations, and seizures. These medications include gabapentin, topiramate, and baclofen, the latter of which is approved in France for alcohol use disorder.
Regrettably, both the FDA-approved and off-label medications for alcohol use disorder have relatively small effects on alcohol consumption. On average, these medications will cause people who drink heavily – meaning 4 or more drinks in a day for women, 5 or more for men – most days of the week to do so 1 or 2 days less per week. However, this average varies significantly between patients – some see a large effect, and some see no benefit.
An important recent focus of research, funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, on alcohol use disorder medications has been the application of a “precision medicine” approach to identify patients for whom a particular medication is more likely to have a large effect.
For example, my work and others’ has found that people who both drink heavily and smoke cigarettes are more likely to benefit from naltrexone. This may be because the additive effects of alcohol and nicotine on dopamine release in reward-related brain regions makes these people particularly likely to benefit from a medication that can block dopamine release by alcohol. Naltrexone also appears to be more effective among people whose drinking is motivated by a desire for the positive, rewarding effects of alcohol, consistent with its ability to reduce these effects.
Finally, recent research suggests that gabapentin may be more effective in people with a history of alcohol withdrawal. Genes that predict medication effects are also being evaluated, but to date none has had consistent effects across studies.
The search for robustly effective medications to treat alcohol use disorder is a significant area of current research. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism funds a multisite research program, in which my laboratory participates, that has evaluated a number of promising candidate medications in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. The FDA typically requires medications to demonstrate efficacy in at least 2 Phase 3 trials prior to approval for a new purpose.
A resurgence of interest in psychedelic compounds in psychiatry has led to preliminary data suggesting that psilocybin, the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms, may reduce drinking when paired with psychotherapy.
Finally, anecdotal reports of reduced interest in alcohol among patients taking GLP-1 agonists – medications that mimic the action of glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone produced by the body after eating – have prompted intense interest in the potential of these medications to treat alcohol use disorder. These include Ozempic and Wegovy, which are FDA-approved for diabetes and weight loss. My laboratory and several others are conducting trials of these medications, with results expected in the next 1 to 2 years.
Alcohol use disorder is a devastating condition for which better treatments are desperately needed. Approved and off-label medications are currently available. As research into new medications continues, patients should seek providers who use evidence-based treatments to have the greatest likelihood of success in gaining control over their drinking.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/us-made-sunscreens-block-only-uv-b-rays/,Why Do US-Made Sunscreens Block Mostly UV-B Rays?,"I recently returned from a trip to Italy, where you can buy a broad-spectrum sunscreen that blocks both UV-A and UV-B rays.
[Editor’s Note: Both organic and inorganic (chemical and physical) broad spectrum screens are available in the US. The current physical filters include zinc, titanium, and iron oxide.]
As someone who has covered the Food and Drug Administration, I know that Europe usually follows the FDA when approving prescription medications. So why are we behind Europe and Asia on something as essential as sunscreens?
The answer lies in the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which requires sunscreens to be tested on animals and classified as drugs rather than as cosmetics.
As summer begins, it is important to remember that skin cancers, which include basal cell, squamous cell, and melanoma, are the most common cancers in the US. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 77,230 new cases of melanoma were reported in 2020 and 8219 people died of the cancer.
Unlike other cancers, most forms of skin cancer are preventable by using sunscreens and limiting time spent in the sun. As someone who grew up in the 1960s and 70s, the use of sunscreens was low while the use of tanning lotions was high (at least in my family). With the advent of sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) as high as 100, people may have gotten a false sense of security about going out into the sun. The SPF rating in the US is the sunscreen’s ability to block UV-B rays, which do not meet the European Union’s standard for UV-A coverage.
Consumer advocates have been asking the FDA to consider allowing market access to some of the ingredients used in products sold in France, Japan, and South Korea. “Many Americans today rely on sunscreens as a key part of their skin cancer prevention strategy, which makes satisfactory evidence of both safety and effectiveness of these products critical for public health,” Cherie Duvall-Jones, an FDA spokesperson, wrote in an email to KFF Health News.
One company has spent the past 20 years trying to gain approval for bemotrizinol, which is a broad-spectrum agent used in most European and Asian sunscreens. If the agent receives FDA approval, “it would be the most vetted and safest sunscreen ingredient on the market, outperforming even the safety profiles of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide said Carl D’Ruiz, a senior manager at DSM-Firmenich, a Switzerland-based maker of sunscreen chemicals.
I would urge health care professionals to lobby Congress for approval of these well-tested products.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/empathy-exhaustion/,Empathy Exhaustion in Nursing,"Empathy is a core component of nursing practice.1 In nursing, empathy is commonly defined as recognizing, understanding, and feeling from the patient’s perspective, and experiencing emotions such as care, concern, or distress as a result of being exposed to a patient’s situation.2,3 Empathy is beneficial for nurses and patients alike, but nurses who experience repeated, prolonged exposure to patients’ trauma and suffering can develop empathy exhaustion (also known as empathy fatigue or compassion fatigue), which can have serious effects on the nurses’ mental, emotional, and physical health.3 This article looks at the role of empathy in nursing, the causes and symptoms of empathy exhaustion, and steps nurses can take to address it.
Peplau, a nurse theorist who examined the nurse-patient relationship, defined empathy as the ability “to be able to sit at the bedside of any patient, observe, and gather evidence on the way the patient views the situation confronting him, visualize what is happening inside the patient, as well as observe what is going on between them in the interpersonal relation.”2
Davis described an “empathy episode” as comprising of the following2:
Although the terms empathy and compassion are sometimes used interchangeably, some have proposed that empathy entails being able to feel another person’s suffering, while compassion includes both feeling and being willing to alleviate another’s suffering.4,5 In addition, some researchers have equated empathy exhaustion with compassion fatigue, while others conceptualize the 2 as related but distinct conditions, with a loss of empathy leading to compassion fatigue.6 Empathy exhaustion can be a contributing factor to burnout, which is chronic stress that can occur in any occupation and is characterized by emotional exhaustion, feelings of depersonalization, and career dissatisfaction.7
Evidence suggests nurses’ empathy can have beneficial effects on their patients, such as improved satisfaction, better adherence to treatment, and better overall health.1,5 Empathy may also improve nurse/patient communication, allowing nurses to better recognize and advocate for their patients’ needs.5 Practicing empathy can also help nurses by allowing them to experience less distress and work-related health issues, making them less likely to burn out and better able to provide effective care.1,5
Empathy exhaustion can occur after prolonged exposure to stressful and taxing patient encounters. Symptoms of empathy exhaustion, include apathy, fatigue, irritability, lack of productivity, poor judgment, callousness, and feeling emotionally overwhelmed and desensitized to the needs of others.8 Symptoms can be categorized as physical, psychological, and behavioral9:
Some researchers consider emotional exhaustion to be a form of secondary traumatic stress resulting from repeated exposure to patients’ injury and trauma, with symptoms similar to those of posttraumatic stress disorder, such as intrusive thoughts, irritability, and avoidance.8,9
While empathy exhaustion among nurses can occur across multiple specialties and settings, it may be more likely in nurses who work in critical care. Nurses working in settings such as oncology or in an intensive care unit (ICU) care for patients with serious illnesses and provide end-of-life care, which can cause distress that leads to emotional exhaustion.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies looked at secondary traumatic stress and burnout among oncology nurses, as measured by the self-report Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL).10  Approximately 67% of these nurses experienced secondary traumatic stress.10
Another study used the ProQOL to examine the incidence of secondary traumatic stress and compassion fatigue among 598 healthcare professionals, including 358 nurses/midwives, who worked in an ICU or other unit that involved treating chronic or serious illnesses.11  Levels of secondary traumatic stress and compassion fatigue were significantly higher in nurses compared to doctors (P =.007) and in those who had previously experienced a traumatic event (P <.004).11 Secondary traumatic stress and compassion fatigue were correlated with increased levels of burnout.11
Strategies nurses can use to prevent or alleviate the effects of empathy exhaustion often focus on being aware of the condition and practicing self-care.9 Nurses can begin by learning about emotional exhaustion, its symptoms, and its consequences, and assessing themselves for symptoms using a tool such as the ProQOL.12 Commonly suggested interventions include the following9:
Other possibilities include taking adequate time for breaks during and between shifts, and maintaining a balance between work and time off.12 In some cases, a nurse experiencing empathy exhaustion may benefit from psychotherapy. Healthcare organizations can support nurses by providing educational programs about empathy exhaustion, resiliency training, and employee assistance programs. Interventions that offer emotional support, such as structured support groups and debriefings about difficult clinical situations led by trained professionals, may also help counteract empathy exhaustion.9 Formal educational interventions that have been used to address empathy exhaustion include the Accelerated Recovery Program, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, the Academy of Traumatology/Green Cross standards of self-care, and the Creative Compassion Model.9

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/rsv-and-pregnancy/,"RSV in Pregnancy: Vaccinations, Prevention, and Treatment Recommendations","Our easy-to-read fact sheets provide clinicians with reliable information to share with patients and their caregivers.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a seasonal lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) responsible for millions of hospitalizations globally on an annual basis. It commonly affects patients who are immunocompromised, individuals who are younger than 5 or older than 65 years of age, and patients with chronic heart and lung disease. Common symptoms of RSV include cough, fever, and shortness of breath, which peak within the first week of infection.1 The risk factors for infection in infants include premature birth. Risk factors in adults and children include existing immune disorders and pulmonary diseases.2
RSV diagnosis requires testing. In the past, diagnosis was based on cell cultures or laboratory tests. More recently, rapid and specific PCR tests have become available.3
Most people are infected by RSV by the age of 2. Frequent reinfection for RSV, even within the same season, is possible. Following the initial infection, any reinfection should be less severe.4
The incidence of RSV in pregnancy is low, with about 2% to 9% of pregnant individuals developing RSV. However, the actual number may be higher because of infrequent testing. Common symptoms of RSV in those who are pregnant include fever lasting 2 to 3 days, runny nose, and sore throat lasting 4 days. Less common but more severe symptoms include wheezing and shortness of breath.4
Those infected with RSV during pregnancy are at a greater risk for developing a severe infection; that’s because the body makes changes to the immune system, heart, and lungs to accommodate a developing baby, while still defending the body from pathogens. Studies have shown that 50% of those who are pregnant may develop severe RSV infections requiring hospitalization. Also, pregnant individuals have a higher risk for hospitalization in the third trimester, as well as for hospitalization due to pneumonia or other respiratory illnesses. Common pre-existing conditions in pregnant women who are hospitalized are obesity, another infection, and asthma.4
Although not clearly understood, RSV in pregnancy has been linked to RSV in babies at birth. It’s believed that this may be possible because the RSV infection in the mother can be passed to the baby in utero.4
Research to address RSV in infants has primarily focused on how the mother passes antibodies to the child during pregnancy.  There are 33 million cases of RSV in infants and children annually in the United States, and infants under 6 months of age account for 46% of RSV-related deaths. RSV is the most common cause of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory tract infections in children and the second most common cause of infant deaths worldwide.5
Babies are especially at risk for a severe infection because they are born with small airways. When they get infections that cause inflammation, the already small airways become even smaller, leading to wheezing and difficulty breathing. RSV infections in infants are associated with severe bronchiolitis that has been associated with recurrent wheezing.2  Infants who get RSV within the first 3 years of life are 3 times more likely to develop asthma.1
Treatments for RSV are mostly interventions to reduce symptoms, like supplemental oxygen and rehydration with intravenous fluids. For patients who are immunocompromised, ribavirin (Virazole®), an aerosolized antiviral medication, is recommended.6
RSV seasonal prevention includes 2 injectables, palivizumab (Synagis®) and nirsevimab (Beyfortus®). Once-monthly palivizumab is given to infants under 2 years of age with serious comorbidities or born at less than 32 weeks gestation.5,6 Single-dose nirsevimab is approved for use in infants who are preterm and full-term with a high risk for infection.6
In 2023, the FDA approved a new RSV vaccine, Abrysvo®. The 1-dose RSVpreF vaccine is recommended for pregnant individuals between 32 to 36 weeks of gestation. The vaccine provides immunity to the mother for 2 years. After administration, it takes 14 days for the mother to develop antibodies that then pass immunity to the baby. The vaccine is intended both to lower the mother’s risk for getting RSV and to protect the infant; the vaccine prevents RSV and lowers the risk for respiratory tract infections in infants up to 6 months of age. With the advent of the new vaccine, infants will only need prophylactic medications in rare circumstances, such as when the infant is born less than 14 days after the mother received the vaccine, or when the mother has HIV.7
RSV infection during pregnancy may be associated with early delivery and low birth weight. Some studies suggest that babies born with RSV are more likely to develop acute respiratory illnesses, asthma, and wheezing, and to require supplemental oxygen.4,5
Although research is ongoing, the RSV vaccine is considered safe during pregnancy. The most common side effects were injection site reactions, headache, nausea, and muscle pain, resolving within 3 days.7
Abrysvo is considered safe to simultaneously get with the other vaccines for pregnancy, including the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap; Boostrix® and Adacel®), influenza (Afluria Quadrivalent® and Fluad®), and COVID-19 (Comirnaty®; Spikevax®) vaccines. Although the Tdap vaccine is considered safe to receive, the pertussis immunity is lessened but still considered protective.7
Those with cold and flu-like symptoms during pregnancy have sometimes used ginger or cranberry to relieve symptoms.8,9 The decision to take any kind of herbal or over-the-counter medication while pregnant should be discussed in advance with a health care provider.  If a high fever develops or RSV symptoms become too severe, an emergency room visit is warranted.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/telemental-health-inequities-among-underserved-youth/,Telemental Health Inequities Among Underserved Youth,"From 2019 to 2020, the use of telehealth among racially minoritized youth (RMY) fell from 62% to 51%, while use among non-RMY youth increased from 38% to 49%, according to one study considering outpatient mental health care.1 After telemental health care (TMH) was adopted and implemented, it became apparent that already underserved communities were lacking access to mental health care. Limited access to and knowledge of technology and an inability to coordinate self-care emerged as significant hindrances to TMH implementation.2 The common denominator linking these obstacles is a lack of equity. To remedy this inequity, it will be necessary to address the root causes, including the lack of diversity and provider shortages within the mental health workforce, the widening digital divide, and structural and systemic racism.3 Foundational training of primary providers in health equity is recommended as a way to enhance young patients’ TMH access.
Mental illness increased among youth during the COVID-19 pandemic alongside other worsening health inequities.1 Systemic barriers to TMH such as geographic location, insurance, race, age, and stigmas surrounding mental health, hindered treatment and became more apparent. Youth in primary care settings met criteria for depression (62.7%) and anxiety (59.1%) based upon their patient health questionnaire-4 results (PHQ-4).4 With such statistics, barriers to access is a topic of interest due to the strong link to social determinants of health and the unintended consequences of widening the TMH access gap.5 Although TMH was introduced to youth as an alternative to in-person mental health assessments, medication refills, and psychotherapy, those in rural areas and underserved communities were deprived of technology access. Many may lack the digital health literacy to successfully navigate online platforms, leading to underserved youth being overlooked when TMH usage became more widely available.6
The US Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion defines social determinants of health as “the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.”7 Healthy People 2030, an initiative of the US Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, proposed a roadmap to eliminating health disparities by dividing them into 5 domains: education access and quality, social influences, the built environment, financial stability, and health care access (Figure 1).8 Each domain must be considered and targeted in order for health equity to be established. Building infrastructures through investing in quality improvement teams, confronting bias and discrimination, and mitigating racism and oppression within health systems are strategic pillars on which to build.
Bias can be categorically typed as omission, classism, interpersonal, and systemic.9 Two common types discussed in literature, however, are implicit and interpersonal bias.10 It is becoming more common for providers to undergo bias training as a result of working in health systems promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. Providers who have not confronted their personal prejudices or biases could eventually find themselves in situations that translate into discriminatory behaviors.11 When bias is left unchecked in a health care setting, equitable care cannot exist. However, when providers accept a lead role in reducing structural and systemic inequalities, a standard for health equity can be set. Knowing the difference between equity and equality is a first step. Equity refers to a freedom from bias, while equality refers to the state of having rights (see Figure 2).12 Equity is the desired goal.
A fear of discrimination can lead young patients to not show up as their most authentic selves during TMH visits.13 Many young patients chose not to show up at all during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is reflected in the 53% of youth who failed to seek help either because they did not know where to go or whom they could trust.13 Youth health visit attendance was poorly understood, since the underlying causes were so varied. According to Brown and colleagues, however, young patients missed key aspects of their mental health assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic because they feared being judged by their providers.14 Others lacked insurance or their insurance was not accepted (see Figure 3).13,15 Many chose not to use videoconferencing based solely upon their living conditions, fluency in English, or demographic (eg, race, gender, or sexuality). A portion of them chose an audio TMH platform instead of videoconferencing to avoid discrimination based upon their gender or skin color.14
Figure 3. Reasons Young People Fail to Seek Help for Mental Health Problems15
Since the 17th century, United States history has operated under oppression, genocide, slavery, and legal segregation.16 For more than 20 generations, non-Black individuals have inherited socioeconomic resources as a byproduct of “slavery, segregation, and racial oppression.”17 At the same time, poverty and lack of access to resources among the descendants of enslaved people have persisted. As a result, an entire demographic of people has lacked basic education, health care, safe neighborhoods, supportive policy, and economic leverage.18
To advance health equity, being cognizant of the association between a young patient’s mental health and structural racism is essential.19 Using frameworks  to rank health care systems and grading them state-wide on their quality of care, accessibility, and equitability provides the accountability necessary to approach racism as a public health threat, with a goal of changing the makeup of the health workforce by bringing in more providers of color.20 Reducing bias, promoting diversity, eliminating racist and unethical health practices, and reframing the public health value of underserved communities are the desired outcomes.
By changing the makeup of the mental health workforce and training all providers to detect mental health inequities among youth, health systems are empowered to confront bias, eliminate racism, and promote diversity.21 Currently, health systems are mandated to have fair hiring and promoting practices. In 2022, the Physician Specialty Data Report found that 63.9% of the physician workforce was White, 20.6% Asian, 6.9% Hispanic, and 5.7% Black or African American.22 The proportion of Black physicians has been stagnant for the past 15 years, which has been attributed to low enrollment in medical schools.22 Gatekeeping and denials of Black residency applicants are reported causes, along with students who could not be retained due to feeling as if they did not fit in. Consistently having a deficit of BIPOC providers over time has justified recruiting of culturally competent individuals to enroll in medical schools and incentivizing them to work in physician-shortage areas to improve patient outcomes.6,23 With more demographically representative providers in the mental health workforce, health outcomes for youth in underserved communities are expected to approach those of their peers.21
Hostetter and Klein suggest ways to diversify the provider workforce. First, they suggest reviewing race-based algorithms in medical school training and conducting curriculum audits. They also suggest offering scholarships designed to diversify medical school enrollment as a motivator to encourage BIPOC students to apply. They encourage recruiting a more representative provider workforce by monitoring hiring practices.15 Lastly, they suggest that improving patient outcomes by pairing young patients with providers who have similar lived experiences and empowering them to be a part of the solution would promote health equity.15
The term “digital divide” has been referred to by Sanders and Scanlon as the gulf between those who have technology and those who do not.24 As early as 2006, Nielsen asserted that the digital divide is not an issue of access, but of a lack of skill and confidence that exclude population groups from technology access.25 The state of having no computer or Wi-Fi access (level 1 of the divide), or digital literacy (level 2 of the divide) has become a wedge between patients and access to mental health treatment. In fact, Turcios described the internet as a “super-determinant” of health.26 Although 94% of youth use the internet, the issues surrounding the digital divide still separate them from their providers.25 The third level of the digital divide involves the gap created by negative emotions felt by patients, such as anxiety and fear, when using technology. Each stage of the digital divide subsequently leads to a vicious cycle of mental health inequities.27
The Inverse Care Law provides a helpful framework for understanding how the digital divide persists decade after decade. Introduced by Julian Tudor Hart in 1971, the Inverse Care Law states that “the availability of good medical care varies inversely with the need for it in the population served.”28 For example, 15% of people in a neighborhood with greater than 30% of residents living in poverty have no device to use, and slightly more than 20% lack access to the internet (Figure 4).6,29 Increasing concern for underserved populations must be a goal for providers to eliminate digital poverty and exclusion.
Figure 4. Internet Device and Service Access6
Data is lacking concerning racist practices in treatment of youth with mental health disorders. The available “research on racism in health care is mainly descriptive, atheoretical, uses racial categories uncritically, and tends to ignore racialization processes, making it difficult to conceptualize racism.”30 Assessing health care equity by looking at race as a social construct and not a biologic determinant is more equitable than many current practices.31
Conducting research that controls for bias would bring validity to studies on bias, discrimination, and racism. Requiring patients to self-identify on surveys when providing feedback on quality of care becomes a hindrance when analyzing systemic inequalities, as bias to appear more socially desirable may come into play when self-reporting.32 Secondly, provider interpretation is also a concern in research on systemic inequities since a provider’s fear of potential liability may cloud their responses. Future research regarding health equity among youth would benefit from gathering feedback in a confidential, unbiased manner from patients and providers.
Health care providers can take lead roles in eradicating structural and systemic inequalities by centering and normalizing health equity in their clinical practices. Being aware of health inequalities allows those in decision-making positions to practice accountability while encouraging colleagues to do the same. Accepting the role of change agents and advocates for young mental health patients and their families requires digital and bias training. Training empowers providers to remain competent in technology, but encourages acknowledging personal bias for self-correction. Strategic steps for providers to combat racism in clinical practice include partnering with underserved community organizations and supporting minority businesses to demonstrate community investment.
Collaborating with medical schools and holding them accountable for equitable curricula leaves less room for race-based or discriminatory practices in admissions and residency program decisions. Health care workers can positively influence strategic response levels to advance health equity. As front-line workers, nurses and physician associates are the change agents and advocates needed for equitable TMH services for underserved youth.15","Tonya Gilbert, MPA, PA-C, DMSc"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/mens-mental-health-strategies/,Strength in Vulnerability: Strategies for Improving Men’s Mental Health,"Addressing men’s mental health has persistently posed a formidable challenge for physicians and health care providers. Although there have been major strides in recent years toward destigmatizing mental health, the pervasive culture of “traditional” masculinity often complicates the treatment landscape. The societal pressure to conform to traditional gender norms has wide-reaching effects on help-seeking and coping behaviors among men.
For health care providers, navigating these multifaceted challenges demands a nuanced understanding of the intersections between masculinity and psychological distress. To address this health care disparity, Psychiatry Advisor spoke with experts to further elucidate the underlying issues affecting men’s mental health and provide physicians with strategies aimed at achieving more effective and inclusive mental health care for all patients.
Although mental illness is more prevalent among women than men, 1 in 8 men report experiencing symptoms of mental health problems1 and about 1 in 10 men experience depression or anxiety daily.2 Troubling, only half of men who experience depression or anxiety will receive treatment in their lifetime and men are approximately 4 times as likely to die by suicide than women. Furthermore, boys and men are disproportionately more likely to develop certain mental health conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and substance use disorder, relative to girls/women.2
Although the causes of and contributing factors to mental health are multifactorial, the societal and systemic pressure to abide by traditional, rigid masculine ideals can negatively influence men’s mental health and prevent help-seeking behavior.3 “My colleagues and I have studied men who score high on a ‘hegemonic masculinity’ scale – meaning they say they believe in a number of traditional masculinity norms such as needing to be the breadwinner and feeling it is appropriate to solve conflicts with their fists,” explained Dena T. Smith, PhD, associate professor of sociology in the Department of Sociology, Anthropology, and Public Health at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. “The higher these men score on the masculinity scale, the worse their mental health tends to be,” she told Psychiatry Advisor. When these men experience perceived challenges to their masculinity, such as a decline in health or wealth, these issues are further exacerbated – especially depression, she added.
“While many mental health disorders, particularly mood disorders, occur without any external cause, when men experience stress that is beyond their ability to manage, this can increase the risk that they may have a major depressive episode or some other mental health event,” said Derek M. Griffith, PhD, founder and co-director of the Racial Justice Institute, founder and director of the Center for Men’s Health Equity, and professor of health management and policy and oncology at Georgetown University in Washington, DC.
Dr Griffith’s statement was supported by a recent survey that assessed men’s mental health, as men reported the top 3 issues that negatively affected their mental health were work-related pressure (32%), financial pressure (31%), and health concerns (23%).4
While there are many commonalities in the presentation of mental health conditions across gender identities, there are certain symptoms that may present differently among men. Previous research suggests that gender differences in socialization, coping, and help-seeking contribute to higher rates of “internalizing” disorders (ie, depression and anxiety) among men and more “externalizing” behaviors (ie, aggression and substance misuse) among men.3 Additionally, men are more likely to engage in high-risk activities when their mental health is affected, relative to women.5 In addition, Dr Griffith explained that excessive work can be a sign of a mental health problem among men, as it may represent an effort to focus on an area of their life they feel they have some control over.
Study findings also indicate that mental health issues among racially minoritized groups, including Black Americans, may be overlooked or inadequately treated.6 “So, there are ways in which these issues can cut across gender, race, class, sexuality, etc., so that some people may be more or less likely to have their symptoms captured by diagnostic instruments,” Dr Smith said.
“Beyond individual idiosyncrasies, mental health issues are ones that affect how someone functions, cares for themselves, interacts with others, and performs in key roles and responsibilities,” Dr Griffith noted. For any population, notable impairment in some or all of these areas – such as persistent anger or irritability, marked changes in mood, sleep or energy level, or misuse of alcohol or drugs – may indicate the presence of mental health issues.7
Despite higher rates of issues such as substance use disorders and suicide among men compared with women, studies have consistently shown that men are significantly less likely than women to seek mental health treatment and to remain engaged in treatment.8 Compared with women, substantially fewer men received any type of mental health treatment (25.7% vs 13.4%), medication for their mental health (20.6% vs 10.7%), and mental health counseling or therapy (11.7% vs 7.2%), according to 2019 data from the Centers for Disease Control.9
In a survey of 1000 men, 40% of respondents had never spoken to anyone about their mental health and 40% of men reported that they would only seek professional help if they developed suicidal thoughts.4 When asked why they had never spoken about their mental health, 29% of men indicated they were “too embarrassed” and 20% cited “negative stigma” surrounding men’s mental health.
“While we assume that men do not seek help for reasons that have to do with how they think about being a man, we must recognize that men often learn that others tell them to ‘get over it’ or ‘suck it up’ or otherwise dismiss their expressions,” Dr Griffith told Psychiatry Advisor. “Men also may feel that nothing can be done to fix the problem, and certainly talking about it cannot help, so why bother?”
Dr Smith echoed these sentiments and noted that there is still stigma among men discussing their problems and seeking help from mental health professionals – especially in certain cultures.10 Men are also typically socialized to avoid talking about emotions other than anger.3
Even when men do engage in mental health treatment, their symptoms may be overlooked or misdiagnosed.11 “My colleagues and I argue that [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders] (DSM) symptom sets do not always accurately capture mental health troubles for everyone, and men in particular can be overlooked,” Dr Smith stated.
Using the example of depression, she pointed to research showing that men with mental health concerns may be more likely to experience anger and physical symptoms and to mask their psychological symptoms with substance abuse.12 “If a clinician is not careful and sticks closely to DSM symptom sets, it is possible to miss the diagnosis or increase the risk of misdiagnosis with men,” she cautioned.
“It’s crucial for clinicians to go beyond diagnostic categories and checklists and make sure to assess context and a patient’s life situation, resources, and any behaviors or experiences that may not fit neatly into DSM categories,” Dr Smith said.
Although many men are solution-oriented and only want to express a problem if they believe it can be solved, this is “not true of every man, so do not go into problem solving mode when you hear a concern,” Dr Griffith advised mental health care providers. When men reach out for help, clinicians should validate how difficult this step can be and ask if they are seeking someone to listen or to help find a solution, he suggested. “If the latter, do not get discouraged by their skepticism of the strategies that you brainstorm together. Remind them that you cannot predict the future and trial and error may be necessary. Remind them that if it were easy, they would have solved the problem already.”
He emphasized the importance of helping men feel they are still respected and loved even when they express fear, vulnerability, and personal concerns.
More broadly, Dr Smith emphasized the need for ongoing efforts to destigmatize mental health treatment for men and to challenge rigid, traditional masculinity beliefs to help improve mental health and help-seeking among men.
“We have to move past the stereotype and assumption that men will not seek help or share their concerns or feelings with others,” Dr Griffith said. “It is important to help them find someone that they can talk with and let them share as they feel comfortable.”
Pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy are effective treatment options for patients managing their mental health disorders. However, some men may be reluctant to engage in these forms of treatment right away. Accordingly, Dr Griffith recommended the following general strategies to improve men’s mental health:
Addressing men’s mental health requires a holistic approach that considers the complex interplay of gender dynamics, societal pressures, and biological susceptibilities. However, breaking down stigma, promoting help-seeking behavior, and providing tailored support services are essential steps in improving men’s mental health outcomes.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/trans-inclusive-language-fosters-care/,Reconceptualizing Women’s Health: Trans Inclusive Language Fosters Care,"Research findings have consistently highlighted numerous factors that negatively affect the accessibility and quality of health care for transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals. In addition to substantial socioeconomic barriers, studies have shown that TGD patients often experience stigma, discrimination, denial of services, and a lack of competent care in health care settings.1-3 In light of these ongoing disparities, there have been increasing calls for culturally competent, gender-affirming care for patients of all gender identities.4,5
According to guidelines published in February 2024 in Fertility and Sterility, the Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) opines the use of inclusive language as a key factor in creating a welcoming environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, and asexual+ (LGBTQIA+) individuals.
For example, the Committee recommends that providers and staff: (1) ask patients which pronouns and names they use (rather than asking which ones they prefer); (2) avoid using heteronormative and cis-normative language such as “husband” or “mom” in favor of more neutral terms such as “partner” and “parent”; (3) and, use clinical forms that contain language representative of all sexual orientations and gender identities.4
This increasing emphasis on using gender-inclusive language has illuminated the limitations of the term “women’s health” to describe the needs and services of all individuals who need such care.6,7
To glean expert insights on reconceptualizing this concept to be more inclusive of TGD individuals, we interviewed ASRM president Paula Amato, MD, MCR, professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology and director of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Oregon Health and Science University School of Medicine in Portland, and Beth Cronin, MD, clinical associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.
Dr Amato: Women’s health care traditionally includes sexual, reproductive, gynecologic, and obstetric care. Exclusionary policies and behaviors in health care often marginalize gender-non-conforming patients and contribute to health disparities. Furthermore, social determinants of health have the potential to act as drivers of health disparities and create barriers to high-quality health care.
Women’s health also includes conditions that affect women differently, disproportionately, or have historically had a bias in delivery of care to women.
Gender-inclusive care means to offer health care in which each patient’s self-defined gender identity — which may differ from the sex assigned at birth — is understood, supported, and affirmed.
Dr Cronin: Traditionally, the term “women’s health” encompassed the care of cisgender women throughout their lifespan, including management of gynecologic issues such as abnormal pap smears, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pelvic pain, abnormal bleeding, contraception, and menopause, as well as pregnancy-related care, including miscarriage, abortion, and prenatal and postpartum care.
This [term] has also encompassed a focus on the difference between males and females in cardiac disease and management of the aging process. If you ask different folks working in different spheres of the health care spectrum, you will likely get varied answers regarding the meaning of women’s health.
Dr Amato: Transgender women are women and should be included and affirmed in women’s health care spaces. Non-binary and transmasculine people with female anatomy should also be able to access expert care without fear of discrimination or harm.
Dr Cronin: “Women’s health” is a problematic term in many spaces for exactly this reason — as it can be a term that excludes others who need the care of the health care team which is traditionally provided in the women’s health space. We should be working to be as inclusive as possible with our language.
Transgender women will often seek and need care in OBGYN offices, family practice offices, and other spaces providing this care, and they should and need to be welcomed. Transgender men and nonbinary individuals with a uterus need to access care traditionally thought of as “women’s health” for a variety of reasons — including STI testing, cervical cancer screening, menstrual suppression, contraception, and pregnancy-related care.
Walking into a women’s health clinic can be extremely challenging and can cause dysphoria if one doesn’t identify as a woman. OBGYNs treat people of all gender identities, including people who are cisgender, transgender, gender non-binary, or otherwise gender expansive.
Dr Amato: Health care providers may inadvertently alienate and exclude transgender men, transmasculine people, and non-binary and gender-non-confirming people assigned female at birth. These are people who may require women’s health care but do not identify as women.
Clinical recommendations include: (1) set a welcoming tone; (2) use gender-inclusive language; (3) focus on anatomy, conditions, and symptoms rather than gender; and, (4) practice person-centered care.
Dr Cronin: Patients may not seek care due to issues such as discomfort and feeling like they won’t be welcomed. Language should be centered around the care that is provided — for example, changing the name from “Women’s Health Clinic” to “Obstetrics and Gynecologic Clinic.” Clinicians should try to eliminate gender-specific language and use inclusive terms whenever possible, such as “pregnant person” or “birthing people” instead of “pregnant women.”
Dr Amato: I recommend the following measures for providers and practices:
Dr Cronin: Health care providers need to educate themselves by taking advantage of seminars, webinars, and other online resources to understand the importance of making their practice inclusive, welcoming, and affirming for all patients.5,8,9 It is critical at this time that clinicians provide a safe space for patients to access care.
Dr Cronin: One of the most pressing issues currently is the outright attacks on transgender individuals across our country. Legislation has been introduced in almost every state to challenge access to necessary health care for transgender individuals. We need to stand behind thoughtful, evidence-based medicine and use our voices as experts, as health care providers, to center the patient in the fight to maintain access to care.
Ongoing research is needed to further best practices, examine advances in the field, advance surgical techniques, and ultimately provide the best possible care for patients.10

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/pa-compact-licensure/,The Dawn of a New Era: How the PA Compact Licensure Is Revolutionizing Practice Across States,"The recent enactment of the PA Compact Licensure marks a significant milestone in the health care field, simplifying multi-state practice and enhancing health care accessibility. This initiative passed after enough states — Delaware, Utah, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Virginia, and Nebraska — passed legislation to meet the necessary threshold, promising profound impacts for PAs and the communities they serve.
Lauren Taylor, DPAS, PA-C, the director of clinical education at the University of Pittsburgh Physician Assistant Studies Hybrid Program and Advanced Practice Clinician director at MedExpress Urgent Care, reflected on this compact’s benefits. With over a decade of experience working in multiple states, Dr Taylor is a vocal advocate for the PA Compact Licensure.
“The PA compact licensure will notably increase flexibility and mobility for PA students, broadening their horizons and preparing them for the evolving health care landscape,” Dr Taylor said. Her dual roles have provided her with a unique insight into the challenges of multi-state licensure, having acquired 11 different state licenses throughout her career.
The compact is designed to streamline the licensing process across participating states, maintaining high standards while facilitating easier mobility. This change aligns seamlessly with educational goals, emphasizing adaptability, lifelong learning, and professional responsibility.
“The compact encourages a crucial understanding of multi-state licensure requirements among PA students. This could potentially transform educational curriculums to include specific modules addressing interstate practice,” Dr Taylor said. This approach ensures the future workforce is well-prepared for the dynamic demands of health care delivery.
Amanda Shelley, MPAS, PA-C, with One Medical, shared the practical challenges of maintaining multiple state licenses in her day-to-day practice. “Managing different state licenses, each with unique CME requirements and renewal dates, is not only burdensome but also detracts from our primary focus — patient care,” Shelley said.
The compact represents a much-needed simplification, reducing administrative burdens and enhancing continuity of care, particularly for patients traveling across state lines.
Shelley, who also plays a pivotal role in PA advocacy as the legislative chair for the Arizona State Association of PAs and is a co-founder of PAs in Virtual Medicine and Telemedicine, has been directly involved in the discussions and creation of the compact. She highlighted the ongoing legislative challenges, noting that “while some opposition exists, the potential benefits significantly outweigh the concerns, promising to enhance health care delivery significantly.”
Both Dr Taylor and Shelley underscored the compact’s potential to improve health care access and delivery, particularly in rural and underserved areas where the shortage of health care providers is acute. “The compact, combined with telehealth, offers a robust solution to health care disparities, especially in rural settings where access to specialists and primary care is limited,” Shelley said.
As the health care landscape evolves, the PA Compact Licensure stands as a beacon of progress, promising to empower PAs with greater flexibility and the tools necessary to provide high-quality care across multiple states. This change supports the professional growth of PAs and addresses critical health care needs across the nation, making it a significant advancement in medical practice and education.Top of Form","Carlos Gutiérrez, EdD, MMS, PA-C"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/american-college-physicians-updates-guideline-type-2-diabetes-treatments/,American College of Physicians Updates Guideline for Type 2 Diabetes Treatments,"The American College of Physicians (ACP) has published an update to the 2017 version of its recommendations regarding newer pharmacologic treatments for type 2 diabetes, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and long-acting insulins. The full update was published in Annals of Internal Medicine.
In 2017, the ACP recommended metformin as an adjunct to lifestyle modifications to improve glycemic control among adults with type 2 diabetes. However, 16% of adults with type 2 diabetes have inadequate glycemic control, which is most prevalent among Black and Hispanic adults compared with White adults.
To assess the effectiveness of type 2 diabetes treatments in reducing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the ACP conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with a duration of at least 12 months.
Critical outcomes included all-cause mortality, congestive heart failure (CHF), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), myocardial infarction alone, progression of CKD, serious adverse events, and severe hypoglycemia. The ACP also assessed patient values and preferences for new treatments, as well as the costs and economic burden of care.
The ACP recommendations apply to nonpregnant adults with long-standing type 2 diabetes and a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of approximately 8%. Because evidence was insufficient to differentiate between patients with and without cardiovascular disease or CKD, these recommendations apply to patients regardless of cardiovascular disease or CKD status.
Metformin and lifestyle modifications should remain the first line of treatment for managing type 2 diabetes. When considering additional therapy, clinicians should weigh benefits vs harms, cost of medications, and individual patient factors such as comorbid conditions and glycemic control targets.
Glycemic control targets should include considerations for hypoglycemia risks, life expectancy, diabetes duration, comorbidities, capacity for self-monitoring, and access to resources. The ACP recommends glycemic control target values between 7% and 8% for most adults with type 2 diabetes. For adults with HbA1c levels below 6.5%, clinicians should attenuate pharmacologic treatments.
The ACP recommends prescribing an SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 agonist as an adjunct to metformin and lifestyle modifications to improve glycemic control among adults with type 2 diabetes. Among patients receiving metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 agonist combination therapy, blood glucose self-monitoring may be unnecessary.
Specifically, the ACP recommends SGLT-2 inhibitors to reduce the risks for all-cause mortality, MACE, progression of CKD, and hospitalization due to CHF. To reduce the risk for all-cause mortality, MACE, and stroke, GLP-1 agonists are recommended.
In the cost-effectiveness analysis, the ACP identified no significant differences between SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists.
According to the ACP, SGLT-2 inhibitors should be prioritized for patients with type 2 diabetes and CHF or CKD, whereas GLP-1 agonists should be prioritized for patients with type 2 diabetes and an increased risk for stroke or total body weight loss goals.
The ACP also recommends the reduction or discontinuation of sulfonylureas or long-acting insulin treatments when adding an SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 agonist to a patient’s treatment regimen. Compared with SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists, sulfonylureas and long-acting insulins were less effective for reducing all-cause mortality and morbidity.
The ACP recommends against prescribing a DPP-4 inhibitor as an adjunct to metformin and lifestyle modifications to improve glycemic control among adults with type 2 diabetes.
In their analysis, the ACP identified no differences in the critical outcomes between patients prescribed adjunctive DPP-4 inhibitors and those who received usual care. Compared with GLP-1 agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors likely increase the risks for all-cause mortality, hospitalization due to CHF, and MACE.
“Benefits and harms of additional pharmacologic treatment beyond the initial add-on treatment are unknown (for example, a patient who receives metformin plus an SGLT-2 inhibitor but in the future receives an additional GLP-1 agonist),” the ACP concluded. “Further, clinical evidence on patient mortality, morbidity, and hospitalizations and economic evidence are lacking for use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists as initial treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/prglac-task-force-initiatives-pregnant-lactating-persons-clinical-research/,The PRGLAC Task Force: Initiatives to Include Pregnant and Lactating Persons in Clinical Research,"In a hybrid meeting held on March 22, 2024, the Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women (PRGLAC), hosted by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), met to discuss past and future recommendations and implementation plans for research and therapies used among this patient population.1
Representatives from multiple federal agencies — including the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — as well as representatives from medical societies, research institutions, and nonprofit organizations, shared presentations on progress and concerns regarding current maternal and fetal research practices.
Historically, pregnant and lactating persons have been excluded from clinical trials due to both maternal and fetal risks. However, it has been reported that 90% of pregnant persons use medications during pregnancy.1,2 The unknown risks associated with medication use during periods of pregnancy and lactation may result in inefficient therapy use when managing ongoing conditions, increasing risks for both parent and child.
Additionally, representatives have reported a growing need for more standardized education for clinicians. Pregnant and lactating persons often seek advice on medication use from obstetricians and gynecologists, rather than consulting more specialized clinicians. The lack of regulated education across all fields of practice leaves pregnant and lactating patients without sufficient information on the benefits and risks associated with medication use during this time.
In 2016, PRGLAC was established by the 21st Century Cures Act in order to address the gaps in knowledge and research pertaining to the therapeutic treatments and practices used among pregnant and lactating persons.3
A total of 15 recommendations were originally reported to Congress in 2018, outlining the proposal to include this population in clinical research.4 The Implementation Working Group of Council was later formed in 2023 to guide implementation across various federal agencies and institutions.5
In their 2018 report to Congress and the Secretary of the HHS,PRGLAC created the following recommendations for addressing the gaps in research including pregnant and lactating persons.4 The full list can be found on the NIHCD website:
Since the initial recommendations were released, the PRGLAC Implementation Working Group of Council has helped to declassify pregnant and lactating persons as a vulnerable population during Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol development and review.6 Situations in which additional safety measures are warranted will now be reviewed by the IRB on a case-by-case basis.
Additionally, a smaller obstetrics pharmacologic research network has been established within the NICHD, a cosponsor of PRGLAC. Webinar series for continuing education and research education grants have been made available for clinicians investigating the therapeutic effects of medications among both pregnant and lactating persons, as well as infants and children.6
Resources for clinicians and patients have been developed to increase communication and enhance research development. The Maternal and Pediatric Precision in Therapeutics (MPRINT) Hub was established to share expertise, drive research development for pregnant and lactating patients, and include patients with disabilities in new therapeutic studies.7 While relying upon existing resources, the Data and Specimen Hub (DASH) was leveraged to allow researchers to collect deidentified data from previously funded NICHD research, particularly for biospecimens including blood and breastmilk.8
Efforts to continue implementing PRGLAC recommendations continue through working group meetings and annual reports to the Secretary of the HHS on its progress.
MotherToBaby® is a free information service that provides evidence-based data regarding the risks and benefits of medications and other exposures during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.9 Staffed by genetic counselors, pharmacists, nurses, and health educators, these specialists answer inquiries regarding medications, vaccines, herbal products, supplements, substances, and maternal health conditions.
MotherToBaby online/mobile services include the following:
MotherToBaby also partners with clinicians and provides them with new and updated fact sheets via newsletters, offers cosponsored quarterly educational webinars for clinicians, and conducts pregnancy studies through research programs in the US and Canada.
Treating for Two is a CDC initiative that addresses issues surrounding safer medication use during pregnancy.2,10
In 2015, the CDC collected data from virtual focus groups to better understand the questions or concerns surrounding medication use that arise during pregnancy.
Kara Polen, from the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities and CDC, presented results from these focus groups.1 The most widely described concern among pregnant persons regarded overall harm toward the baby due to medication use, followed by concern for the patient’s own health, and fear of unknown risks from medication use. Other common concerns included adverse and long-term side effects, risks to the fetus during each trimester, and the risks associated with no treatment during pregnancy. The participants who received conflicting information from providers were left more frustrated and had to seek out additional information. They tended to trust their obstetricians and gynecologists the most during pregnancy, followed by relatives, friends, and social networking sites. The participants also stated that hearing similar experiences via family, friends, or blogs was a powerful source of information that supplemented facts and research.
A key takeaway, Polen noted, was that the participants wished they had received the same information about medication risks from all providers, as this consistency would have enhanced the trustworthiness of the information they received.
Investigators from the CDC also conducted a birth defects study to evaluate pregnancy exposures (BD-STEPS), to help clinicians better understand the causes or risk factors for birth defects.11 The BD-STEPS study was built on population-based surveillance programs in 7 states. These analyses are still ongoing.
Polen concluded that longer-term opportunities and ideas for consideration involve “improving messaging and training for pharmacists and specialty care providers who may be providing care to pregnant individuals.” Polen continued, “There is potential to enhance communication materials for patients and making them more free of [medical] jargon, include some personal stories that are easy to understand, visuals, partnering with other experts, like lactation, immunization and response, and [lastly, consolidating] a hub to house information on [all pregnancy- and lactation-related] topics.”1
Rachel Gandell Tetlow, a senior director of Government and Political Affairs at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), presented an overview of ACOG’s advocacy work1,12:
The ACOG 2024 commitment to action plan prioritizes the following13:
Rebecca Abbott, senior director of advocacy for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) and chair of the Coalition to Advance Maternal Therapeutics, presented on behalf of the SMFM. The SMFM supports the clinical practice of maternal-fetal medicine by providing education, promoting research, and engaging in advocacy to optimize equitable perinatal outcomes for all people who desire or experience pregnancy.14
As part of the SMFM advocacy agenda, the top 5 priorities for furthering maternal-fetal medicine research include the following1,14:
Among these priorities, Abbott emphasized that better mentorship is important and necessary to invest in. The SMFM encourages others to think innovatively about trainees and early career investigators to invest in new and existing networks.
Lesley Samedy Bates, program officer of the Obstetric and Pediatric Pharmacology and Therapeutics Branch, NICHD, emphasized the need to foster the development of clinician-scientists who will be leaders in the field of pediatric clinical pharmacology research.
Bates presented data on the Clinical Pharmacology Training Network (CPTN),15 in which the T32 Fellowship is funded through the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act.16 The network currently focuses on collaboration, career, development, mentorship, research experiences, virtual networks, and lecture series. Bates expects that fellows and scholars will participate in the CPTN in its current state and continue to advance the program as it grows and expands.
The maternal pharmacology programis one of the latest ongoing developments to run parallel with the pediatric (neonate to adolescents) training program.1,15 There is currently a paucity of data available to guide practitioners regarding the appropriate medication dosing and counseling for pregnant and lactating individuals. Bates added that the increased availability of individual fellowship awards for maternal pharmacology and therapeutics would address these challenges. The inclusion of a maternity pharmacology training program aligns with research priorities for advancing safe and effective therapeutics and devices for PRGLAC women, children, and people with disabilities.
The PRGLAC Implementation Working Group of Council also referred to President Biden’s executive order of new actions to advance women’s health research and innovation, issued on March 18, 2024. These actions include17:
The members of the PRGLAC task force are committed to raising awareness and increasing the information readily available to pregnant and lactating persons, ensuring their safety and offering patients peace of mind during this important time.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/lawsuits-discuss-breaches-of-patient-privacy/,Two Lawsuits Discuss Breaches of Patient Privacy,"The first case involved a patient who sued a hospital after he found out that someone he hadn’t told about his diagnosis was aware of it. In January, the patient, Mr W, who was the owner of an ambulance company, felt ill and went to the emergency department (ED) of his local hospital accompanied by his girlfriend and his secretary. In the ED, the patient was diagnosed, prescribed oral antibiotics, and released. When he did not improve, he returned to the ED the next day, again accompanied by the 2 women. This time he was admitted and treated for the next 8 days. While in the hospital, he saw a former employee who now worked for a competing ambulance company who wished him well.
After Mr W was discharged and returned to work, one of his employees indicated that she knew Mr W’s medical diagnosis, causing him great shock and embarrassment. When he asked where she learned this information, he was told that it was from an employee of the other ambulance company. Mr W contacted the hospital with his concerns that his private health information had been improperly disclosed.
The hospital’s privacy officer immediately launched an investigation. She interviewed all the medical staff who had been working in the ED when Mr W was treated. All indicated that they neither disclosed the medical information nor knew who had. The investigation revealed that no one other than hospital staff had accessed Mr W’s computerized hospital record.
After an extensive investigation, which included speaking to the employees of the other ambulance company, the privacy officer concluded that no hospital employee had disclosed Mr W’s private information and that the hospital had properly protected his information.
Mr W sued the hospital for a variety of issues, including the unusual choice of using res ipsa loquitor as the theory of negligence. The hospital moved to dismiss the claim against it. The trial court granted the hospital’s motion, and the patient appealed.
Res ipsa loquitor means “the thing speaks for itself,” and the doctrine recognizes that in some situations, an occurrence is so unusual that the person in control of the situation should be held responsible. To establish res ipsa loquitor the plaintiff must demonstrate that:
For example, imagine a person who was crushed by a piano as they were walking past the loading dock of the piano company. Even if no one witnessed the accident, it’s obvious that the only one in control of the piano was the piano company, and that should not have happened – the thing speaks for itself.
Mr W’s argument was that the hospital (and its clinicians) had exclusive control of his medical information, and because his diagnosis was leaked, it must be the fault of the hospital – res ipsa loquitor. The court of appeals, however, did not accept this argument and concluded that the hospital did not in fact have exclusive control of Mr W’s private medical diagnosis because he himself had shared the diagnosis with 3 people not associated with the hospital – his girlfriend, secretary, and mother. The case against the hospital was dismissed.
Ms P worked as a nurse for the same employer for over 40 years until she was discharged from employment for violating her employer’s privacy policy.
The nurse shared a home with her son and her son’s girlfriend. While at the house on a lunch break from work, Ms P encountered her son’s girlfriend, who had contracted COVID-19. It appeared to Ms P that her son’s girlfriend was developing pneumonia and out of concern she suggested that the woman seek care at the emergency department. The girlfriend declined. Ms P still felt that the young woman needed medical treatment and after returning to work, she accessed the woman’s medical chart to search for a medical appointment opportunity. Because Ms P and her son’s girlfriend shared the same address, the computer’s records system flagged Ms P’s actions.
An investigation took place and it was determined that Ms P had violated the employer’s privacy policy. Ms P was terminated from her employment. She applied for unemployment benefits and was denied because it was determined that she had engaged in employment misconduct. Ms P appealed the decision of the state’s Department of Employment and the case went to the state’s Court of Appeals.
Ms P argued that her action in accessing the chart was based on concern for her son’s girlfriend and her desire to have her get medical help. The court, however, found that concern is not a credible business reason that would give Ms P justification for accessing the medical records. The court also refused to accept Ms P’s claim that her conduct was what an “average reasonable employee” would have done under the circumstances.
“The average reasonable employee follows her employer’s reasonable policies,” wrote the court in its decision. The court also noted that the record showed that the employer expects “employees to strictly follow its privacy policy, leaving no place for an employee’s judgment or discretion as to whether they may access patient information without a business reason.” Ms P’s claim was denied.
Although these 2 cases are very different, the takeaway is the same – privacy issues are taken extremely seriously. In Case 1, the hospital was able to demonstrate that they had launched an exhaustive investigation, ultimately ruling out employee misconduct, inappropriate computer medical records access, and the patient information board in the ED as sources of the privacy leak. The hospital also had information that the patient had told at least 3 other people of his diagnosis, thus the hospital was not in total control of the information and could prove this.
In Case 2, the nurse lost her job and her opportunity for unemployment benefits because she had accessed records out of concern, but not for a legitimate business purpose (such as treating a patient). An employee should never access medical records of anyone who is not a patient or who has not properly granted them access. Most computer systems are now sophisticated enough to track who is accessing records and ensure that they are being used properly.
It’s always a good idea to review your employer’s privacy policy periodically and be sure you understand what is covered.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/power-outages-low-income-communities/,Power Outages Linked to Heat and Storms Are Rising: Low-Income Communities Are Most at Risk,"The Conversation — Many Americans think of power outages as infrequent inconveniences, but that’s quickly changing. Nationwide, major power outages have increased tenfold since 1980, largely because of an aging electrical grid and damage sustained from severe storms as the planet warms.
At the same time, electricity demand is rising as the population grows and an increasing number of people use electricity to cool and heat their homes, cook their meals, and power their cars. A growing number of Americans also rely on electricity-powered medical equipment, such as oxygen concentrators to help with breathing, lifts for movement, and infusion pumps to deliver medications and fluids to their bodies.
For older adults and others with health conditions, a loss of power may be more than an inconvenience. It can be life-threatening.
We study environmental health, including the effects of extreme heat and storms on people. In a new study, we analyzed data from New York City and the surrounding area to understand how severe weather drives power outages and who is most at risk, particularly in urban areas.
How quickly power returns in a community is often shaped by history.
Discriminatory practices such as redlining and zoning, which prevented Minority residents from obtaining mortgages or owning homes in certain areas, left marginalized groups living in more disaster-prone areas with poorer quality infrastructure. Studies show that both factors make these communities more likely to experience prolonged power outages.
Current policies can also exacerbate outages for these populations. For example, many electric utilities prioritize power restoration to regions with community assets, such as mass transit, hospitals, police or fire stations, and sewage and water stations, as well as regions with larger populations.
Though these guidelines appear neutral, they can inadvertently prolong outages for less populated areas and areas lacking resources, including these key assets. For example, following Tropical Storm Ida in September 2021, Con Edison outlined areas with important community assets as priorities for restoring power. Manhattan had power back within hours, while many low-income and largely Minority parts of Queens, the Bronx, and Brooklyn waited for days.
Emerging evidence from studies on power outages in Texas, Florida, the Southeast, and a national study, along with our new research in New York, shows that outages especially burden communities that don’t have adequate funding.
Across New York state, we found that 40% of all outages from 2017-2020 followed severe weather – heat, cold, wind, rainstorms, snowstorms, or lightning – within 8 hours. While each type of severe weather alone could lead to prolonged outages, in combination they resulted in much longer outages.
Statewide, for example, strong winds alone led to outages lasting 12 hours on average, and heavy precipitation resulted in outages lasting 6 hours on average. But when wind and precipitation happened simultaneously, the outages lasted closer to 17 hours on average.
A 6- to 8-hour power-restoration threshold is particularly important for people who rely on electricity to power medical equipment. Many of these medical devices have backup batteries with capacities that do not exceed eight hours. That’s one reason researchers considered 8 hours to be a critical power restoration window for health.
We also looked at whether socially vulnerable communities faced more weather-driven outages than other communities. In short, the answer was yes, though the effects varied in different parts of the state and by the type of weather event.
In New York City, we found that heat-, precipitation- and wind-driven outages occurred more frequently in socially vulnerable communities, including in Harlem, Upper Manhattan, the South Bronx, and Eastern Queens. This matters because socially vulnerable neighborhoods have higher poverty rates and lower-quality housing. Community members may lack access to health care or suffer from underlying health conditions.
On average, the duration of precipitation-driven outages was longest in areas of the city with the highest social vulnerability. In neighborhoods with vulnerability scores in the top 25% – meaning the most vulnerable neighborhoods – outages lasted 12.4 hours on average, compared with 7.7 hours in those neighborhoods in the bottom 25%.
In rural parts of the state, outages related to downpours or snowstorms were also longest in areas with high social vulnerability.
As temperatures rise over the summer, it’s important for communities to consider the dangers that outages can present for disabled persons, older adults, and others with health conditions, particularly in socially vulnerable communities.
Extreme heat is one of the most dangerous meteorological phenomena. It causes nearly 400 premature deaths a year in New York City, according to city estimates.
With the granular data we obtained from the State Department of Public Service, we could zoom in on how fast outages began following extreme weather.
Across the state, outages began quickly – within 6 hours of extremely hot temperatures spiking – likely as more people turned on their air conditioners. This means the outages likely occur while it is still hot, exposing individuals to extreme heat, without power for air conditioners or fans.
Coupled with higher outdoor temperatures and the prevalence of underlying health conditions, socially vulnerable communities face heightened exposure to heat-driven outages and greater risk from them.
This outage trend will likely continue as climate change intensifies, bringing more frequent extreme weather to an aging grid in which many parts are nearing or surpassing their life spans.
There are steps communities and power providers can take to reduce people’s exposure to power outages and the health harms that can accompany them.
In the short term, cities can develop targeted plans for these communities to ensure that residents have ways to cool off during heat waves. That includes providing ample cooling centers, swimming pools, and public parks with shade trees. It can also include transportation support for older adults and others with mobility issues.
In the long term, reducing these risks means updating the power grid, weatherizing buildings, planting trees to reduce urban heat island effects and investing in distributed energy resources, such as solar power and batteries for energy storage.
We believe this work should prioritize communities that most need these updates, following the lead of New York state’s Weatherization Assistance Program, which aims to improve energy efficiency for low-income households.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/dermatologic-look-alikes-palmar-blisters/,Dermatologic Look-Alikes: Palmar Blisters,"A 58-year-old woman presents for evaluation of palmar blisters that appeared 2 months ago. The blisters are intensely pruritic and the severity of itching waxes and wanes. The patient is otherwise healthy, enjoys gardening, and frequently handles plants and soil without gloves. She has a long history of “sensitive skin” but reports not using moisturizer frequently. On physical examination, many deep-seated small subcutaneous vesicles (resembling the pearls of tapioca pudding) are seen scattered on the bilateral palms, coalescing into tense blisters in certain areas. Mild diffuse xerosis of the skin is noted.
Can you diagnose this condition?
Dyshidrotic eczema (DE) is a clinical variant of palmoplantar dermatitis presenting as a pruritic vesiculobullous eruption affecting the palms or soles. The term dyshidrosis was first used to describe this entity in 1873 by English dermatologist Tilbury Fox, who mistakenly attributed the condition to a disorder of sweat glands.1 In 1876, Sir Jonathan Hutchinson described the same condition under the name of cheiropompholyx: cheiro derives from the Greek for hand and pompholyx from the Greek for bubble.1 Although understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanism has evolved with time, the terms dyshidrosis and pompholyx are both still in use.1-3
The exact incidence and prevalence of DE is difficult to ascertain. In an analysis of insurance claims data from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database, which currently includes information from 50 million Americans, 35,000 people were diagnosed with DE in 2018.4 Among these patients there was a slight female predominance and the average age of diagnosis is in the 4th decade of life.4 Children were the least common age group diagnosed with DE.4 In this same study, the most common occupations of DE patients were in the service industry or in manufacturing.4
The mechanism of DE is not fully understood. Contrary to what the name dyshidrosis would suggest, DE is not caused by sweat duct pathology. However, DE patients often have coexisting palmoplantar hyperhidrosis that can exacerbate their DE, likely because of a contributory irritant reaction.2 Some authors consider DE to be merely a manifestation of other conditions that can cause hand dermatitis (eg, atopic dermatitis, allergic or irritant contact dermatitis, etc) rather than its own disease entity.3 Reported triggers include ingestion of certain substances, such as nickel, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration, stress, heat, and sunlight.3
Clinically, acute DE is characterized by the sudden onset of tense deep-seated vesicles that can coalesce into bullae, symmetrically distributed on the palms or soles but often favoring the lateral digits, with intense pruritus. The vesicles are classically described as appearing like the pearls of tapioca pudding.2,3,5 The condition usually involves episodes of relapse and remission, and vesicles often resolve with desquamation of thick scales.3
Histologically, intense spongiosis is seen that can progress to intraepidermal vesicle formation. Sweat glands are normal.3,6
Diagnosis of DE is primarily clinical. Skin conditions that must be excluded include bullous tinea manuum or pedis, allergic or irritant contact dermatitis, scabies, and palmoplantar pustular psoriasis.
Tinea manuum is frequently accompanied by tinea pedis or onychomycosis; therefore, the patient’s feet should be checked. Scraping of scale with potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation can be performed to look for fungal hyphae, or a swab for fungal culture can be collected. Although it is a more invasive test, a biopsy may reveal fungal hyphae in the stratum corneum.6
Psoriatic nail manifestations such as pitting, onycholysis, or ridging, classic psoriasiform lesions observed elsewhere on the body, or family history of psoriasis can raise suspicion for palmoplantar pustular psoriasis (PPPP), rather than DE.7 Smoking, tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNF-α), and lithium have all been associated with PPPP.2,7 Histologic evaluation can help distinguish PPPP from DE; PPPP demonstrates neutrophils in the stratum corneum forming pustules and minimal spongiosis.2,6
A careful social history that considers the patient’s occupation and hobbies should be taken to investigate potential allergen or irritant exposures and to exclude contributory contact dermatitis. Patch testing for common allergens may be considered.
Scabies can also present with acral vesiculopustules and intense pruritus. However, scabies classically presents with linear interdigital burrows representing the intracorneal path of the burrowing mite. Additional sites frequently involved in adult scabies, unlike DE, are the groin, axillae, umbilicus, areolae, and buttocks.2 Household contacts of scabies patients may also exhibit similar symptoms, whereas household contacts of DE patients would be expected to be unaffected. If scabies is suspected, mineral oil preparation of a skin scraping should be evaluated under the microscope to look for mites or scybala.2 A punch biopsy for H&E stain evaluation can sometimes capture a mite as well.
Initial treatment of DE primarily involves thick, bland emollients and topical corticosteroid application. Topical calcineurin inhibitors or topical retinoids may be helpful adjunctive therapy.3,5 Patients should be counseled to avoid common irritants such as household cleaners and prolonged water exposure, and to wear gloves during activities such as dishwashing and gardening. If patients have concomitant palmar or plantar hyperhidrosis, this should be treated as it can also help their DE.2 Patch testing can be considered to exclude contributory allergic contact dermatitis.
For chronic refractory cases recalcitrant to initial therapy, psoralen and UVA phototherapy (PUVA), dupilumab, oral retinoids, or systemic immunosuppressants can be considered.3,5,7
The patient in this case was prescribed clobetasol 0.05% ointment and instructed to apply twice daily, with petroleum jelly over top and under occlusion. She was advised to start wearing protective gloves while washing dishes and gardening. After several weeks she experienced marked improvement in her symptoms, continuing with daily petroleum jelly application and glove protection for maintenance. However, she still occasionally uses clobetasol 0.05% ointment twice daily as-needed for intermittent flares.
A 42-year-old man with no significant past medical history presents for evaluation of a rash involving one of his hands and both feet that has been present for several months. The rash is intensely pruritic and the patient has tried over-the-counter 1% hydrocortisone cream, which offers mild benefit, but the rash worsens after discontinuation. Physical examination reveals scaly annular plaques in a moccasin distribution on the bilateral soles of the feet, thick yellow dystrophic toenails, and a scaly annular plaque on his left hand. On the hand and both feet, the plaques are studded with small 1-mm pustules.
Can you diagnose this condition?
Dermatophyte derives from the Greek meaning skin and plant. Dermatophytes are a group of filamentous fungi that cause cutaneous infections in humans and animals by infiltrating keratinized tissues. Dermatophyte infections likely have afflicted mammals since prehistoric times.9,10
The Sanskrit medical text Charaka Samhita from the 2nd century BC documents a condition, called Dadu, reminiscent of tinea corporis.9 Approximately 30 AD, the Roman medical encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus described a purulent scalp condition that was later dubbed “the kerion of Celsus,” a highly inflammatory form of tinea capitis.10 For centuries this group of cutaneous diseases have been called tineas, which is Latin for moths. This naming reflected the pathogenic entity’s noted predilection for keratinized tissues, like that of clothes-eating moths that also consume keratin in textiles, fabrics, rugs, etc.10 Given the frequently annular shape on the skin, the English word ringworm has been used for centuries to describe this same condition.10 In 1837, Polish physician Robert Remak discovered hyphae in favus, another severe form of tinea capitis, illuminating the fungal etiology of tinea conditions.10 In 1934, the American mycologist Chester Emmons proposed a taxonomic schema of dermatophytes that is still widely used today, which divided the group into 3 genera: Microsporum, Trichophyton, and Epidermophyton.9
In common nomenclature, a dermatophyte infection is called tinea followed by the Latin word indicating the cutaneous location affected. For example: tinea corporis is a dermatophyte infection of the body, tinea pedis is a dermatophyte infection of the foot, and tinea manuum is a dermatophyte infection of the hand.
It is estimated that one-fourth of the world population suffers from superficial fungal infections, and the majority of these are dermatophyte infections.11-13 According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were nearly 5 million outpatient visits for dermatophyte infections in the US between 2005 and 2014.11 Most tinea infections occur in adults, except for tinea capitis, which is more common in childhood.14 Risk factors for dermatophyte infection include warm humid climates, living environments with poor hygienic conditions and crowding, male sex, diabetes mellitus, and household contacts with tinea infections.11,12,14
Dermatophytes can be transmitted to humans from other humans, animals, or environmental sources like soil.14 Dermatophytes produce keratinases that enable them to infiltrate the stratum corneum.14 Areas of compromised skin barrier are at increased risk for dermatophyte invasion.14 The most common dermatophytes causing tinea manuum are Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floccosum.14 Generally, the incubation period for a dermatophyte infection is 1 to 3 weeks, followed by the development of an erythematous scaling plaque that may be annular with central clearing.14 Tinea infections are typically pruritic.
Compared with other tinea infections, tinea manuum often involves minimal inflammation and manifests predominantly with scale. However, tinea manuum can alternatively present with prominent scale, even involving vesicles or pustules (as with the patient in this case).14 In cases of tinea manuum, there is often concomitant tinea pedis, so the feet should be examined as well. Tinea manuum is rarely associated with onychomycosis of the fingernails.14
To diagnose tinea manuum, a clinical examination is often sufficient in classic cases. If the patient also has concomitant tinea pedis or if the scaly plaque on the hand is very annular, the diagnosis of tinea manuum may be obvious. However, scraping the scale for KOH preparation can be helpful; if fungal hyphae are seen under the microscope, this may help diagnose a dermatophyte infection. In indeterminate cases where the clinical examination and KOH preparation are not diagnostic, a punch biopsy can be performed.
Histology of dermatophytosis typically shows a spongiotic epidermis with fungal hyphae in the stratum corneum. When vesicles or pustules are present clinically, intra-epidermal vesicles or pustules may be present on histology.6
The differential diagnosis of vesiculobullous tinea manuum includes allergic or irritant contact dermatitis, scabies, or palmoplantar pustular psoriasis. Scraping of scale for KOH preparation would not reveal fungal hyphae in these other conditions. Additionally, a biopsy of these other entities would not show fungal hyphae in the stratum corneum. Typical scabies on the hands has interdigital linear burrows representing the path of the mite, and co-involvement of intertriginous regions is common in adults with scabies.2 Mineral oil preparation of a scraped burrow in scabies often captures the mites or scybala, a finding not present in tinea. Allergic or irritant contact dermatitis usually improves with limited topical steroids and continued avoidance of triggering exposures. If a tinea infection is incorrectly diagnosed as eczematous condition and treated with topical steroids, transient improvement is seen followed by prominent flare after steroid withdrawal; this phenomenon is called “tinea incognito.” Patients with palmoplantar pustular psoriasis may demonstrate other stigmata of psoriasis, such as nail pitting or psoriatic lesions elsewhere on the body.7
Treatment of tinea manuum is similar to the treatment of other dermatophyte infections. If the tinea manuum is mild and limited in extent, topical antifungals with antidermatophyte activity such as terbinafine 1% cream can be used for several weeks. If the tinea manuum is severe, or if there is extensive tinea infection elsewhere (such as tinea pedis or onychomycosis), then a course of oral antifungals such as terbinafine should be considered. Other oral antifungal agents with antidermatophyte activity include fluconazole, itraconazole, and griseofulvin.14
Fungal culture for speciation and sensitivities can be considered at the time of diagnosis or if the condition is refractory to first-line empiric antifungal treatment.
The patient in this case was treated with oral terbinafine (250 mg/d) and counseled to discontinue any topical steroid use. An oral, extended terbinafine course of 12 weeks was chosen because of concomitant onychomycosis along with the tinea manuum. The patient experienced full resolution of his tinea manuum and tinea pedis several weeks into his treatment course. Six months after his treatment, his toenails grew out with a normal appearance.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/stress-awareness-month-mindfulness-heart-health/,Stress Awareness Month: Mindfulness and Heart Health,"April was Stress Awareness Month, the perfect excuse to get stress under control. Although cardiologists may recognize the undeniable link between stress and heart health, they’re far from immune to its harmful effects. Mindfulness is a promising way for physicians and patients to find relief.
Mindfulness is an ancient practice gaining steady traction in modern medicine. This cost-effective intervention improves quality of life and reduces health care costs and hospitalizations.1 In addition, mindfulness interventions don’t interfere with existing treatment plans but may enhance their efficacy.
Although mindfulness can be packaged into different formats (meditation, yoga, or as part of cognitive behavioral therapy), the basic principle involves actively focusing on the present to relax the body and mind.
The time has come for overstressed physicians to teach by example through practicing mindfulness. If you’re still not convinced, here’s the evidence.
The relationship between stress and cardiovascular health is complex. When the body perceives a threat or experiences stress, it triggers a cascade of physiological responses, including the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and epinephrine. These hormones spike heart rates, raise blood pressure, elevate blood sugar, and boost inflammation.
Chronic stress, characterized by persistent activation of the body’s stress responses, can assault the cardiovascular system over time. Research has established a clear link between chronic stress and an increased risk for hypertension, heart disease, and stroke. Moreover, stress worsens existing cardiovascular conditions, making management and treatment more challenging.
The impact of stress on heart health is well-established. Although mindfulness has become a popular buzzword in health and wellness spaces, it’s not necessarily a common practice. Fortunately, basic mindfulness exercises can be done anywhere, anytime. All you need is a few minutes in a quiet space.
To practice mindful meditation, follow these steps:
Group mindfulness programs can increase accountability for regular practice. Making a conscious effort to focus on the present and clear your mind can turn almost any steady-state activity into a mindfulness exercise, including walking, swimming, and bike riding.2 Participating in mind-body activities helps harness the benefits of mindfulness while providing the added benefit of some physical exercise, through tai chi and yoga, for example.
While most physicians agree that their patients would benefit from mindfulness practices, carving out time for mindfulness isn’t always a priority for doctors themselves. Knowing in real numbers how mindfulness can impact health helps build a case for it.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that calming the mind calms the body. A 2013 review of 9 studies published in the AHA journal Hypertension found meditation reduces systolic blood pressure by 4.7 mm Hg and diastolic by 3.2 mm Hg.2 In another study, 5 minutes of daily meditation positively affected heart rate variability. This measure of heart attack and stroke in those without cardiovascular disease showed improvements within just 10 days of consistent meditation practice.2
In another meta-analysis, which included 16 studies and 1,476 adults, mindfulness-based interventions significantly improved psychological distress, enhancing self-awareness, attention, and emotional regulation.3 This review observed more drastic impacts on blood pressure, with an average 14 mm Hg reduction in systolic and a 5 mm Hg decrease in diastolic readings for participants in mindfulness-based intervention versus control groups.
Most recently, a 2024 meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials confirmed that structured mindfulness-based intervention programs effectively reduce blood pressure in participants with prehypertension and hypertension.4 These benefits were more pronounced in men. The researchers noted, “In addition, the results also support previous studies which showed that MBIs [mindfulness-based interventions] can lower blood pressure in patients with other diseases, such as breast cancer survivors, coronary heart disease, and diabetic patients.”
By promoting relaxation responses, mindfulness modulates stress hormone levels, counteracting the harmful physical effects of chronic stress. It targets emotional distress, helping prevent disease and slow disease progression.
In a systematic review of mindfulness interventions for patients with heart failure, researchers concluded that practicing mindfulness is “beneficial for patients with heart failure in reducing depression and anxiety and enhancing health-related quality of life in the short term.”1 Some studies noted improvements in physical symptoms like fatigue, unsteadiness, dizziness, and breathlessness. In 1 of the studies reviewed, researchers observed sustained positive effects on depression and anxiety lasting 3 months and 6 months after the completion of mindfulness programs.
Although the long-term effects aren’t always documented in studies, there’s no downside to practicing mindfulness, and the potential for ongoing benefits makes developing a mindfulness habit worthwhile.
Physicians, as caregivers entrusted with the health and well-being of others, often find themselves navigating high-pressure environments fraught with stressors. From demanding workloads and long hours to the emotional toll of patient care, the medical profession is inherently predisposed to stress and burnout.
Studies show physician burnout is at an all-time high, and cardiologists are no exception. One survey of almost 6,000 cardiologists found that 42% of cardiologists feel burned out, and 83% have symptoms of colloquial depression.5 While 16.9% of cardiologists surveyed reported having a mental illness, only 34.2% attempted to get help. The top cited barriers stopping cardiologists from seeking mental health support included privacy concerns (34.5%), time constraints (30.8%), shame (29.5%), and fears about how it would impact their professional advancement (28.6%).
Although mindfulness isn’t a sufficient replacement for mental health treatment, it’s a practical option with the potential to improve cardiologists’ everyday lives. By integrating mindfulness practices into their daily routines, physicians can develop a greater self-awareness, emotional regulation, and compassion for patients.
Prioritizing self-care and stress management sets a positive example for patients and colleagues, reinforcing the importance of holistic health practices. Cardiologists can lead the way in championing initiatives that promote a culture of well-being and mindfulness among others.
Stress Awareness Month isn’t just for patients. Cardiologists can harness the power of mindfulness and other stress management strategies to improve their lives. By learning and doing mindful meditation, cardiologists promote the highest level of heart health care for themselves and others.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/acute-pancreatitis-management-guidelines/,Acute Pancreatitis Management: Guidelines From the American College of Gastroenterology,"The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) has released guidelines about the management of acute pancreatitis (AP) in The American Journal of Gastroenterology.
In the United States, AP accounts for more than 1 million patient days in the hospital and more than $2.5 billion in health care costs. The incidence of AP has been increasing by 2% to 5% yearly, while the mortality rate has remained unchanged at 5000 to 9000 deaths annually.
These guidelines from the ACG focus on early medical management, complicated disease, and evolving issues of antibiotics, nutrition, and interventions. Guideline authors also formulated 23 key concepts summarized by overarching topics below:
Patients with AP typically present with epigastric or left upper quadrant pain, usually described as constant pain that radiates to the back, chest, or flanks. To diagnose AP, patients should have 2 of the 3 criteria of abdominal pain consistent with disease, serum amylase and/or lipase more than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and/or characteristic abdominal imaging findings.
The most common AP etiologies are gallstones (40%-70%) and alcohol (25%-35%), but AP can also be medication-induced, caused by infections, or related with metabolic dysfunction.
The ACG recommends that patients undergo abdominal ultrasound to assess for cholelithiasis. Identification of gallstones should prompt referral for cholecystectomy in order to prevent recurrence and biliary sepsis. Cholecystectomy is also recommended for fit patients who present with secondary AP of no identifiable cause. The ACG recommends against routine computed tomography (CT) for determining the severity of AP. However, CT may be used for patients who fail to improve within 48 to 72 hours. In the absence of gallstones and/or significant alcohol use, patients should be evaluated for serum triglyceride levels and the etiology should be defined as elevated triglycerides if they have levels above 1000 mg/dL. If a patient is aged older than 40 years and AP etiology has not been established, patients should be evaluated for the presence of a pancreatic tumor.
The ACG recommends that patients with AP undergo a hemodynamic status and risk assessment to stratify patients into low- and high-risk categories. Risk factors for a severe disease course include obesity, altered mental state, comorbidities, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), elevated creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), elevated hematocrit, pleural effusions, and pulmonary infiltrates, among others. Clinicians should be aware that scoring systems and imaging alone cannot accurately predict which patients will develop severe AP. Patients who have organ failure and/or SIRS should be continuously monitored. However, the patients who present with mild disease should still be monitored closely for 48 hours for the onset of severe disease and organ failure.
Regardless of staging, all patients with AP should receive moderately aggressive intravenous hydration with isotonic crystalloid. Fluid resuscitation is likely more important in early-stage disease. Blood urea nitrogen levels should be monitored within the first 48 hours of fluid resuscitation, in which decreased BUN levels reflect decreased renal perfusion. The ACG recommends caution during fluid resuscitation among patients with cardiovascular and/or renal comorbidities.
In addition, there are caveats about fluid resuscitation therapy. Although it is the first-line treatment for AP, there remains debate about the timing, the type, and the degree of benefit from early hydration. The ACG recommends use of lactated Ringer solution over normal saline, as it has been associated with improved electrolyte balance due to the presence of calcium and reduced pancreatic injury due to the presence of lactate.
For the subset of patients with cholangitis, the ACG recommends patients undergo early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) within the first 24 hours of onset. For patients without cholangitis and/or jaundice, magnetic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasound is recommended. ERCP for the purpose of diagnosis should be avoided to reduce risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP).
To reduce PEP risk, the ACG recommends using 100 mg rectal indomethacin before or immediately after ERCP among all patients without a contraindication. Some patients at high risk for PEP may also benefit from receiving a pancreatic duct stent.
Antibiotic therapy should only be used in the case of infected necrosis in combination with debridement and necrosectomy. The role of antibiotics in infected necrosis is to delay surgical, endoscopic, and radiologic drainage more than 4 weeks, or completely, in the case that antibiotics resolve the infection. The ACG advises that routine use of antifungal agents with prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotics are not required.
Infectious complications may be avoided among patients with moderate to severe disease with enteral nutrition. Parenteral nutrition should be avoided when possible and a nasogastric delivery route is preferred over a nasojejunal route.
The ACG recommends that surgical, radiological, and/or endoscopic interventions be delayed by 4 weeks among stable patients with pancreatic necrosis to allow for collection maturity. Minimally invasive surgical approaches are recommended over open operation. For the patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitis, the ACG recommends early cholecystectomy.
“It is important for clinicians to appreciate that AP is heterogenous, progressing differently among patients and is often unpredictable,” the guideline authors noted.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/neurologic-lyme-disease-patient-perspective/,What It’s Like to Live With Neurologic Lyme Disease: A Patient Perspective,"Lyme Disease Awareness Month runs throughout the month of May. It is a month that helps increase awareness and improve efforts on how to reduce the burden of the disease for patients. Approximately 15% of patients with Lyme disease will develop Lyme neuroborreliosis, or neurologic Lyme disease,1 which is an infectious disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It can be challenging for patients with neurologic Lyme disease to be diagnosed, especially if they do not present with typical symptoms.
For Maria Arini Lopez, it took her almost 2 years to be accurately diagnosed with neurologic Lyme disease. Looking back, Lopez considers herself one of the more fortunate patients, as she recalls learning that it can take more than 2 years to receive an official Lyme disease diagnosis. Lopez, who lives in central Maryland, shared that her COVID-19 pandemic hobby — gardening — was most likely the culprit of her infection in the spring of 2021.
She did not experience any of the tell-tale signs of Lyme disease, which includes the “erythema migrans” rash – often characterized by its “bull’s eye” appearance. Lopez admits that her unusual symptoms made it challenging for clinicians to diagnose her with Lyme disease. This led to her extraordinarily complicated diagnostic journey.
To better understand what it’s like to live with neurologic Lyme disease and how clinicians can improve diagnosis and alleviate disease burden for patients, Lopez recounts her experience from her gradual onset of symptoms to receiving an official diagnosis and how the disease has impacted her daily life.
Lopez: I had dramatically varied experiences with 8 different clinicians, including a primary care physician (PCP), optometrist, dentist, otolaryngologist, urogynecologist, rheumatologist, neurologist, and an integrative medicine physician.
I first saw my PCP in early July 2021 for an annual physical and full workup. I expressed feeling concerned that something was just not right. I was having trouble sleeping and felt depressed. I was also a lot more fatigued than usual.
The PCP dismissed my basic labs (complete blood count, metabolic panel, and urinalysis) as ‘normal,’ and told me that I was ‘doing okay,’ despite my communicating that I was struggling. My PCP confirmed that I had a urinary tract infection (UTI), another urgent care provider gave me antibiotics, and I was sent on my way.
My eyes and mouth became very dry, to such a degree that I began to think it might be Sjogren syndrome or some other autoimmune disease. Several years ago, I had been diagnosed with dry eye and had been faithfully following the dry eye regimen recommended by my optometrist, but it was no longer effective. I had the lowest grade for the dry eye testing thanks to the regimen I was prescribed. Now, I had confirmed grade 3 staining, despite following the same regimen. Based on all my symptoms, she agreed that something systemic was going on and that further testing was now necessary.
When I went to my dentist for my biannual cleaning, I told her about the abnormal sensations, or lack thereof in my lips and tongue, as well as the strange itching in my ears, and she acknowledged my suspicion that I might have Sjogren syndrome. She stated that compared with other patients she knew who had Sjogren syndrome, I had more saliva in my mouth, so she did not think it was the likely culprit, but that it might be worth ruling out. She highly recommended that I see an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor.
The ENT doctor who I saw was extremely thorough. She ordered brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to check for anything that may have been affecting the cranial nerves. Although the MRI was negative, it still ruled out certain outcomes. She also diagnosed me with ear eczema and prescribed a steroid cream and steroid ear drops for both ears. These medications helped immensely with the itching and flaking; however, they did not resolve the underlying discomfort, occasional sharp pain, and lack of flexibility in the cartilage of my right ear.
The ENT recommended I see a rheumatologist to completely rule out Sjogren syndrome and other potential autoimmune conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The rheumatologist was wonderful! She listened carefully to my medical history and immediately ran a series of more in-depth serological tests for a variety of autoimmune and rheumatic conditions that could possibly explain my symptoms. All of these tests, however, were negative.
Lopez: Cognitive deficits became apparent, including short-term memory loss, severe brain fog and lack of clarity when thinking, slower processing speeds, and impaired executive function. What used to take me 30 minutes to complete now took hours. I no longer worked as a physical therapist, and symptoms were severely impacting my daily function and work as a freelance medical writer.
Other notable symptoms included daily headaches, neck stiffness, intermittent dizziness and vertigo, severe fatigue and flu-like symptoms, mood disturbances, and whole-body flushing similar to hot flashes that would last up to 30 minutes or longer. My right knee joint began to feel swollen and arthritic. As a manual physical therapist, I had worked for a decade in outpatient orthopedic settings with individuals with knee osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, so I knew what an arthritic knee felt like to the touch.
I finally turned to a neurologist. After listening to the timeline of my symptoms, he thought of 2 potential explanations. I either had a vitamin B12 deficiency that was contributing to what he called “subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord,” or there was something of a systemic and infectious nature, possibly viral, that was impacting my neurologic function. He prescribed sublingual B12 along with folic acid and B2 supplementation for 3 months to see if my neurologic symptoms improved. If not, he would investigate possibility that it was an infectious disease.
Lopez: After 3 months, the supplements had not improved my symptoms, and my health continued to deteriorate. I was preparing to undergo a lip biopsy in January 2022 to see if Sjogren syndrome was the answer. The ENT doctor mentioned that sometimes blood tests did not always effectively rule out Sjogren syndrome, but that a biopsy would be a definitive next step in the diagnostic process.
I read a story about a patient’s experience with an integrative medicine doctor in Northern Virginia. I knew in my gut that I needed to schedule an evaluation with this doctor, or someone else at his practice. On the day I was scheduled for my lip biopsy, I cancelled my appointment and scheduled a virtual telemedicine visit with the integrative medicine specialist. By this time, I was fatigued to the point that traveling any distance took maximal effort.
After listening to my lengthy story, which I had now told upwards of 8 times, the integrative medicine doctor wrote a referral for me to undergo 52 blood tests, including a genetic test called GENIE, as well as the line blot serum tests for Lyme disease. On February 9, 2022, I finally found out that I had an active Lyme infection with Borrelia burgdorferi.
According to LabCorp, diagnosis of Lyme disease using Western blot testing requires positivity of 1 of the following 2 patterns:
My results indicated an IgM-positive pattern, reading:
Although it may have provided more detailed information to definitively confirm a Lyme neuroborreliosis diagnosis, I never underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which experts recommend in addition to serological testing.1,2
Lopez: The integrative medicine specialist immediately started me on oral doxycycline. He provided me with extensive background information on the Herxheimer response, preparing me for the possibility that I may feel worse before I felt better. He also prescribed a substantial number of oral supplements to help my body better cope with the die-off and detoxification process. I received an email with a detailed explanation as to each supplement’s purpose and how I was to take them.
After 4 months of treatment with antibiotics and supplements, the Lyme bloodwork was now negative, with only one band (Borrelia burgdorferi 41kD Ab.IgG) showing up as positive.
Fast forward to April 2024, although I completed a successful antibiotic, my sensory paresthesia throughout my body began to worsen again. I underwent additional neurologic testing, including nerve conduction velocity and electromyography testing for upper and lower extremities, a brain MRI without contrast, and complete spinal MRIs with and without contrast.
According to my neurologist, although my large nerve fiber axons seemed mostly intact, Lyme infection has the potential to trigger onset of small fiber neuropathy, contributing to my chronic, widespread skin sensory disturbances as well as several autonomic signs and symptoms, including:
These symptoms can flare up again during an acute viral or bacterial infection. A skin biopsy will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy. Regardless of the final diagnosis, I learned that Lyme disease can affect not only the CNS, but the peripheral nervous system too.
Lopez: Active listening to the whole story in its entirety is critical and medical gaslighting happens, even to other health care providers, and it is unacceptable. Our symptoms and stories are valid, and they should not only be believed, but taken seriously to avoid potentially permanent neurologic deficits.
It is understandable that health care providers can be limited by their scope of practice or area of specialization, but they should never be limited in terms of referring their patients to a specialist or provider who they think might be able to find answers and provide solutions. These recommendations often lead the patient in the right direction and at the very least do not leave them hanging without answers or effective treatment. Continuity of care matters.
Also, not every patient will present with a history of a tick bite or an erythema migrans rash. These patients may experience progression of concerning symptoms that can mimic other conditions, complicating accurate diagnosis and enabling an acute, early-stage Lyme infection to transition into a chronic, late-stage infection that pervades multiple body systems, including the central nervous system, joints (especially the knees), and heart.
If patients present with inexplicable or atypical symptoms and happen to live in a Lyme-endemic region, testing for Lyme infection may be well worth the effort.
Thank you to all the health care providers that listen, believe, and actively seek answers without giving up. You give patients like me hope for a better future.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/caffeinated-fast-food-drinks-cardiovascular-risks/,Caffeinated Fast Food Drinks and Cardiovascular Risks,"Caffeinated energy drinks sold at popular chain restaurants have become the focus of increasing attention recently since wrongful death lawsuits were filed attributing 2 cardiac-related deaths to the consumption of Charged Lemonade from Panera Bread. In September 2022, a 21-year-old woman with long QT syndrome (LQTS) died from cardiac arrhythmia due to LQTS after consuming an unspecified amount of the drink and a 46-year-old man died in October 2023 from cardiac arrest due to hypertensive disease after drinking 3 cups of the beverage.1,2
The lawsuits filed by the families of these individuals allege that the caffeine content of the drinks was not properly advertised and that consumers were not warned about the associated risks.3
Paul Leis, DO, assistant professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, believes that many clinicians are aware that highly caffeinated energy drinks are on the market but may be “unaware of how much caffeine they contain and whether they exceed the recommended daily limit of 400 mg as outlined by the FDA,” he said.4 “Also, some patients may have multiple of these drinks per day, which can be harmful.”
Various studies have linked the consumption of energy drinks to a wide range of cardiovascular side effects, including increased blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, prolonged QT interval, cardiac arrest, coronary disease, heart failure, and aortic dissection.5
According to Helga Van Herle, MD, cardiologist and associate professor of clinical medicine with Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, the consumption of drinks with high caffeine content can be especially risky for individuals with pre-existing cardiac conditions. These include rhythm disturbances, those with caffeine sensitivity, and those taking medications with the potential to cause side effects such as heart palpitations or tachycardia. “For example, prescription stimulants or stimulant-like medications for conditions including ADHD, narcolepsy, and other sleep-related issues, commonly have palpitations or tachycardia as a side effect. High levels of caffeine intake have the potential to exacerbate these symptoms.”
Although the caffeine content of beverages can vary substantially depending on a range of factors, the approximate amount of caffeine found in commonly consumed drinks is as follows:
The large Charged Lemonade from Panera Bread contains approximately 390 mg of caffeine. In comparison, the large size of the recently launched Sparkd’ Energy drink from Dunkin’ includes an estimated 192 mg of caffeine.6,7
“I think issues arise when someone significantly exceeds the recommended limit, typically as an acute ingestion rather than habitual use,” said Catherine Benziger, MD, MPH, director of research at Essentia Health Heart and Vascular Center in Duluth, Minnesota, and member of the American College of Cardiology’s Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Council. “Drinking 2 or more high-energy caffeinated drinks can put the consumer well over the daily recommended caffeine limit and at risk for heart-related events.”
Dr Van Herle noted that, along with caffeine, energy drinks often contain other substances intended to increase energy, such as guarana, ginseng, and ephedra, which may have proarrhythmic effects.8
In general, Dr Benziger recommended that patients not exceed the recommended limit of under 400 mg of caffeine per day. This equals “approximately 4 cups of coffee, and the caffeinated drinks at Panera and Dunkin’ would also fall within this range but only if you drink just one,” she said. She pointed out that other products also contain various amounts of caffeine, such as ice cream, chocolate, foods containing coffee, and caffeine pills. While many of these products can typically be safely consumed within reasonable limits, using them “in combination can greatly exceed the recommended daily limit and put people at risk for a variety of heart issues such as increased heart rate, blood pressure, and abnormal heart rhythms, such as supraventricular tachycardia.”
Dr Leis recommends that patients with known cardiac disease, especially arrhythmias, avoid consuming energy drinks to reduce the risk of associated complications. “In particular, for arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, the high caffeine content from these drinks could potentially put patients who have rate-controlled atrial fibrillation into an uncontrolled ventricular rate and lead to potential complications,” he explained.8
Additionally, patients with hypertension who consume high amounts of caffeine can experience increased blood pressure due to adrenergic stimulation, he said. “For those who have had a myocardial infarction or have established coronary artery disease, increased heart rate and blood pressure resulting from these energy drinks could potentially cause symptomatic angina from the increased demand on the heart.”
In addition, Dr Benziger noted that people may use caffeine to compensate for inadequate sleep, and depending on the individual, may benefit from improved sleep habits including earlier bedtimes and less screen time in the evening toreduce their reliance on caffeine. For other patients, undiagnosed sleep apnea may be causing excessive tiredness.
“We know poor sleep is associated with cardiovascular disease and heart attacks. The American Heart Association Life’s Essential 8 recommends 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night for adults,” she said.9 “If people are using caffeine because they are often tired and not getting good-quality sleep, I recommend they talk to a doctor about it.”
Along with steps consumers can take to reduce caffeine intake, several safety measures are needed on the public health level. “We need to have full transparency on the caffeine content of energy drinks so people will know how much caffeine they are getting and whether they are over the recommended level,” Dr Leis stated. Currently, the FDA does not regulate energy drinks or require sellers to list the caffeine content of beverages.10,11
“Another thing I would really like to see is some sort of warning label that perhaps certain populations should avoid these drinks, including but not limited to those with known cardiac conditions and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding—if we start off with at least those 2 groups, I think we would be headed in the right direction,” he suggested.
Dr Van Herle also pointed to the need for labels listing the other energy-boosting ingredients in these drinks to allow patients to make more informed decisions.
Transparency about ingredients and caffeine levels of energy drinks is “particularly important for children, who are often attracted to these drinks because they’re popular or their friends are using them or they are for sale at their schools,” Dr Benziger emphasized. She cautioned that young children are especially susceptible to the effects of caffeine and said pediatricians advise that children under 12 years avoid caffeine consumption, that all children and teens avoid energy drinks, and that those ages 12 to 18 years limit caffeine intake to 100 mg per day at most.12
“Providers other than cardiologists should be educated and informed of the risks associated with these drinks as well, as they may also be involved in the care of at-risk individuals,” Dr Van Herle added.
Numerous questions warrant attention in future research regarding highly caffeinated beverages. According to Dr Van Herle, “There are several things health providers need to better understand, including how highly caffeinated beverages affect individuals with specific cardiac conditions—especially those at risk for lethal arrhythmias; how these beverages interact with prescription medications that can potentiate an individual’s risk of a heart arrhythmia; and whether individuals in different age groups are more or less at risk of cardiac issues that may stem from consumption of these drinks, especially since much of the marketing is geared towards a younger age group.”13
Dr Leis would like to see research examining the incidence of arrhythmias among individuals with daily consumption of highly caffeinated energy drinks to gauge whether rates are higher in this group compared to individuals with less frequent consumption. Such data could inform recommendations regarding the risk of developing arrhythmias among individuals who frequently consume these beverages.
There is an ongoing need for further research regarding safe levels of caffeine intake and which populations are at risk for acute caffeine toxicity, Dr Benziger stated. She also cited an urgent need for data on the use of energy drinks among adolescents, as nearly one-third of those aged 12 to 17 years reportedly consume these products on a regular basis.14 “This is not my area of expertise as I’m an adult cardiologist, but I think that any behavior that starts in adolescence may track into adulthood and could lead to chronic diseases or poor health habits in the future.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/immunotherapy-inhalant-allergy-aao-hns/,Immunotherapy for Inhalant Allergy: AAO-HNS Issues Clinical Practice Guideline,"A clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for inhalant allergy identifies quality improvement opportunities for clinicians who administer allergen immunotherapy (AIT). The guideline was published in Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery.
Issued by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, this guideline is intended for clinicians involved in the administration of immunotherapy for allergic patients aged 5 years and older with allergic rhinitis, with or without allergic asthma, who are candidates for immunotherapy or treated with immunotherapy for their inhalant allergies in any care setting.
“The goal is to optimize patient care, promote safe and effective therapy, reduce unjustified variations in care, and reduce the risk of harm,” the guideline development group (GDG) stated. The GDG comprised 17 panel members with expertise in otolaryngology, allergy, or clinical practice guideline development, as well as a consumer/patient representative.
The clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for inhalant allergy consists of 12 key action statements developed by the GDG. Each key action statement is classified as either an option, recommendation, or strong recommendation.
The GDG developed the guideline action statements based on substantial evidence. Two literature searches were conducted from October through December 2022, with a targeted search in March 2023, for relevant articles published in English. The evidence supporting the guideline includes 23 clinical practice guidelines, 46 systematic reviews/meta-analyses, 62 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 81 observational and other studies. Evidence-based statements in the guideline are graded using the Oxford Center for Evidence‐Based Medicine grades of evidence, and recommendation strength was based on an adapted version of the American Academy of Pediatrics classification.
In its first key action statement, GDG recommended that AIT should be offered to patients with allergic rhinitis, with or without allergic asthma, if the patients’ symptoms are inadequately controlled with medical therapy, allergen avoidance, or both, or if the patients have a preference for immunomodulation. The goal of this recommendation is to ensure that patients are offered appropriate immunotherapy and to minimize underuse, said the authors. High‐quality evidence, including 61 RCTs and multiple systematic reviews, support AIT’s effectiveness for achieving symptom control in patients with allergic rhinitis. AIT can also improve quality of life and reduce rescue medication use in this population.
Key action statement 2 addresses who should not receive AIT. Part A of this action statement recommends that AIT not be initiated in patients who are pregnant, have uncontrolled asthma, or are unable to tolerate injectable epinephrine. Notably, available evidence and most recommendations suggest that AIT can be continued safely in women who have already been receiving the treatment before pregnancy and are on maintenance immunotherapy dosing, but the authors advise that women should avoid starting immunotherapy for the first time during pregnancy. Caution is warranted for using epinephrine in patients with hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic drugs and closed‐angle glaucoma, as well as hypertension, angina, and tachycardia.
Part B of the second action statement, which was classified as an option, offered the guidance that clinicians not initiate AIT in patients who use concomitant beta‐blockers, have a history of anaphylaxis, or have systemic immunosuppression. In patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), clinicians should not offer sublingual immunotherapy [SLIT] but may still offer subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). In HIV‐positive patients, the decision to use AIT should be made after discussion with these patients about the risks and related evidence, the guideline authors said.
Key action statement 3 recommends that patients should be evaluated by an appropriate clinician for signs and symptoms of asthma before initiating AIT, and that before subsequent AIT is administered the patients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of uncontrolled asthma. According to the GDG, asthma screening and assessment should include subjective data gathered through symptom screening and may also include subjective and/or objective assessments. Before each SCIT injection, clinicians should evaluate patients for worsening and uncontrolled asthma and temporarily withhold SCIT until asthma control is achieved, the authors noted.
Key action statement 4 recommends that clinicians educate immunotherapy candidates on the differences between SCIT and SLIT, the latter of which may be offered in aqueous and tablet form. Patients should be educated regarding the relative risks, benefits, convenience, and costs of SCIT vs SLIT. The GDG suggests using a handout or other teaching aid when possible. Both interventions are safe; however, because sublingual routes (aqueous and tablets) are associated with a relatively reduced prevalence of systemic reactions, many providers are able to offer SLIT as a home‐based intervention with daily administration and without direct physician oversight.
In key action statement 5, the guideline recommends that clinicians educate their patients about the potential benefits of AIT with respect to preventing new allergen sensitizations, decreasing the risk of allergic asthma, and the potential for changing the natural history of allergic rhinitis such that benefits continue after treatment is discontinued.
Compared with other treatments for allergic rhinitis, SCIT and SLIT can induce sustained immunologic changes that may underlie sustained clinical benefits. AIT may also decrease the onset of asthma and reduce asthma symptoms and medication use in patients with allergic rhinitis, with a more robust effect observed in children.
Evidence is mixed on whether AIT is effective in reducing the risk of new allergen sensitizations among patients.
In key action statement 6, the guideline recommends that clinicians who administer SLIT to patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis should offer preseasonal and coseasonal immunotherapy. Multiple RCTs of preseasonal and coseasonal administration have found that SLIT in either aqueous (SLIT-Aq) or tablet (SLIT-T) form are effective. Pollen SLIT‐Aq can improve allergic rhinitis symptoms with birch and ragweed extracts, and 5‐grass pollen SLIT‐T and ragweed SLIT‐T have been effective and safe. Preseasonal and coseasonal regimens may have better economic and compliance benefits compared with continuous regimens owing to their shorter treatment duration.
In key action statement 7, the guideline recommends that clinicians who prescribe AIT limit treatment to patients with clinically relevant allergens that are associated with a patient’s history and are confirmed with testing. The selection of allergens for immunotherapy should be guided by both clinical assessment and allergy testing, according to the CDG. The clinical assessment should note the season in which symptoms occur and triggering exposures. Some studies have shown that AIT benefits pertain only to allergens targeted in immunotherapy, but other studies suggest that AIT may generally down-regulate allergic inflammation through nonallergen-specific mechanisms. Notably, effective doses vary for allergens and among SCIT, SLIT‐T, and SLIT‐Aq. Clinicians thus need to include patients in shared decision‐making regarding AIT formulations, the GDG noted.
In key action statement 8, which is classified as an option, the guideline suggests that clinicians may treat polysensitized patients with a limited number of allergens. In the United States, SLIT tablets are available for grass, ragweed, and house dust mites (HDMs). SLIT‐Aq allows for simultaneous treatment with multiple allergens, although SLIT‐Aq is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Research suggests that single‐agent immunotherapy, such as for HDM or grass, may provide satisfactory control of symptoms for polyallergic patients. Evidence also supports the use of multiple AIT and using 1 or a few allergens by subcutaneous or sublingual routes.
In key action statement 9, the guideline recommends that clinicians who administer AIT should continue escalation or maintenance dosing when patients have local reactions to AIT. Local reactions do not predict systemic reactions, and evidence does not support routine dosage adjustments for local reactions. According to the GDG, patients should be advised that escalating dosage after a local reaction does not increase the risk of either a local or systemic reaction.
Key action statement 10 is the guideline’s only strong recommendation. Here, the guideline advises that clinicians who perform allergy skin testing or administer AIT must be able to diagnose and manage patients with anaphylaxis. SCIT is safe for managing patients with allergic rhinitis as well as allergic rhinitis with conjunctivitis and allergic asthma, noted the authors. Systemic and fatal reactions are rare but are a primary concern when administering AIT. “Clinicians administering AIT must remain vigilant, should be familiar with recognizing the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and be prepared to render emergency management,” stated the GDG. “Similarly, patients should also be educated to recognize the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis as well as being educated on how to administer epinephrine.”
Clinicians are advised to monitor patients for at least 30 minutes after administering SCIT, because most severe reactions occur within that time, noted the authors. Differentiating anaphylaxis from vasovagal syncope can be challenging because these conditions can present with similar symptoms. Vasovagal syncope may be associated with prodromal symptoms of nausea and diaphoresis, and anaphylaxis frequently is associated with urticaria and respiratory distress. An emergency action plan with instructions for using epinephrine should be reviewed with patients on AIT, according to the authors. Antihistamines may be included as adjunctive therapy, but they should not be administered before or in place of epinephrine, the GDG stated.
In key action statement 11, the guideline recommends that clinicians avoid repeat allergy testing to assess the efficacy of ongoing AIT unless there is a change in environmental exposures or a loss of symptom control. Clinical outcomes of AIT are generally evaluated from a patient’s report of a reduction in symptom severity and a decrease in the need for concomitant medication. Skin testing or serum immunoglobulin E antibody testing during treatment is not recommended. “Awareness by clinicians who provide AIT that clinical symptoms and medication use are better markers of effective AIT than repeat allergy testing both reduces unhelpful testing and eliminates the continued administration of AIT inappropriately based on persistently positive allergy tests,” the GDG stated.
In its final statement, key action statement 12, the guideline recommends that patients with symptomatic control should be treated with AIT for a minimum of 3 years, with ongoing treatment duration based on a patient’s treatment response. Few trials have been specifically designed to evaluate the duration of immunotherapy efficacy, and diagnostic tools are inadequate to identify which patients will have a sustained prolonged clinical remission after discontinuing AIT. “The duration of AIT beyond the recommended minimum duration of 3 years should be determined through a shared decision‐making process after educating on the benefits and risks associated with discontinuing or continuing inhalant AIT,” the authors stated.
In addition to the guideline, the GDG plans to work with its patient advocate to develop educational materials, including a patient handout comparing SCIT and SLIT.
“Implementation of the proposed recommendations contained in the guideline will need additional written and online resources, ideally integrated within electronic medical records and decision support tools,” the GDG stated.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/obstructive-sleep-apnea/,Obstructive Sleep Apnea: An Underrecognized Sleeping Giant,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disease process wherein the upper airway repeatedly collapses or becomes obstructed during sleep, which can induce intermittent hypoxemia.1,2 Obstructive sleep apnea leads to complete or partially reduced airflow, resulting in frequent awakenings that a person may or may not be aware of. This cyclic process of sleep disruption causes sleep fragmentation and results in poor sleep quality.
Obesity is a potent risk factor for the development and progression of OSA and is common in the US, affecting nearly 40% of the population.1,5 Despite the high prevalence of obesity and the knowledge that obesity is a significant risk factor for OSA, it is estimated that 80% of adults with OSA remain undiagnosed.5 Screening and evaluating patients with known risk factors for OSA should be an essential part of preventive medicine within the US, as it could reduce the healthcare burden and complications related to untreated OSA.
Clinicians should be aware of the serious complications associated with untreated OSA. Obstructive sleep apnea may significantly increase the risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, resistant hypertension, and mortality.6-8 Patients with untreated OSA can also experience excessive daytime sleepiness, higher rates of depression, and an increased chance of motor vehicle accidents.9-10 In addition to cardiovascular disease and cognitive and behavioral conditions, untreated OSA is a risk factor for diabetes mellitus as well as the development of malignant and non-malignant tumors.11,12
Patients at risk for OSA should be promptly identified. In addition to obesity, a common risk factor for OSA is older age.13 Muscle tone in the upper airways becomes weaker with age, putting older adults at higher risk for a collapsed airway and leading to apneic events during sleep.
An increase in neck circumference also serves as a risk factor for OSA, as well as a predictor for the severity of OSA.14,15 Patients at increased risk for OSA usually have a neck size greater than 17 inches in men and 16 inches in women. Neck circumference can have a higher association with OSA compared to body mass index (BMI).
Anatomical abnormalities, including skeletal and soft tissue irregularities, can also predispose patients to OSA by narrowing the upper airway. Examples include a retro-positioned mandible, short maxillary length, narrow anterior cranial base, enlarged tongue, longer uvula, and enlarged tonsils.16,18
Patients at risk for OSA may complain of waking up gasping for air, snoring, or having apneic events.19 Additionally, patients can report uncontrolled daytime tiredness, morning headaches, difficulty concentrating and memory impairment, irritability, nocturia, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction.19-21
The United States Preventative Service Task Force (USPSTF) currently concludes that there is insufficient evidence for the benefits or harms in routinely screening asymptomatic adult patients for OSA.22 However, this recommendation only applies to patients who are asymptomatic or without risk factors, which is a key distinction. Patients with risk factors or associated symptoms should be screened for OSA. In population surveys previously conducted, 86% to 95% of individuals with clinically significant OSA reported no prior OSA diagnosis, and the majority of primary care clinicians do not screen patients for OSA.22,23  Additionally, it is not unusual for patients to ignore or not talk about symptoms that may be concerning for OSA with their provider.
There are multiple questionnaires including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Berlin questionnaire (BQ), and the STOP-Bang questionnaire (SBQ) to screen for OSA. The SBQ is an 8-item survey that evaluates snoring, tiredness, observed apneas, blood pressure, BMI, age, neck circumference, and gender.24 The SBQ questionnaire is one of the most sensitive assessment tools available, making it a preferred screening method. The SBQ assesses risk factors and symptoms, while the ESS assesses daytime sleepiness by quantifying the likelihood of falling asleep in 8 different situations, such as watching television or sitting quietly as a passenger in a car.24 It is important to note that although questionnaires can be useful in screening for OSA, these are not diagnostic tools and should not replace diagnostic studies.25
When evaluating patients for a narrow upper airway, using the Mallampati classification system can help determine if patients are at risk for OSA (Table 1). A Mallampati classification of III or IV has a high association with OSA and can be used as a predictive assessment for patients at risk.16 A Mallampati classification of III is when only the base of the uvula is visible, and a Mallampati classification of IV is when the soft palate is not visible. This exam is performed by evaluating the patient’s posterior pharynx when they are sitting in the upright position, mouth open, with their tongue protruding.17
Patients with OSA risk factors, signs and symptoms, or abnormal screening results should undergo diagnostic testing. An in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) is currently the gold standard diagnostic test; however, not all patients require an in-laboratory PSG.26 Instead, some patients can undergo home sleep apnea testing (HSAT), but there are certain restrictions to this.
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) reports home sleep apnea testing should be reserved only for patients at increased risk of moderate to severe OSA, which would include patients who experience excessive daytime fatigue and at least 2 of the following criteria: diagnosed hypertension, habitual snoring, or witnessed apnea or gasping or choking.25 The diagnostic impetus for ordering an HSAT should be to confirm highly suspected OSA.
If the results of the HSAT are technically inadequate, negative, or inconclusive, then AASM recommends performing an in-lab PSG—further supporting that HSAT should only be used in patients highly suspected of having OSA, in order to avoid unnecessary repeat testing. Certain patients who are at an increased risk for complex forms of sleep apnea, including those with a history of stroke, cardiac or respiratory disease, neuromuscular disease, or opioid usage, should undergo in-lab PSG testing.25 Additionally, certain workers (ie, police officers, airline pilots, truck drivers, taxi or ride-sharing drivers, etc) as well as patients suspected to have non-respiratory sleep disorders (ie, limb movement disorders, parasomnias, narcolepsy, etc) should also undergo in-lab PSG testing.
The diagnosis of sleep apnea is based on the patient’s apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), which is a combined average of apneic and hypopneic events a patient experiences per hour.27 An apneic event occurs when there is complete or nearly complete cessation of airflow (90% or greater) for a minimum of 10 seconds; a hypopneic event occurs when airflow decreases by at least 30% and lasts for 10 seconds. Mild OSA consists of an AHI between 5 and 15; moderate OSA consists of an AHI between 15 and 30; and severe OSA is diagnosed with an AHI greater than 30 (Table 2). Apneic events will be reported as either obstructive, central, or mixed. If patients are experiencing multiple central or mixed apneic events this could be indicative of central or mixed sleep apnea. For patients diagnosed with uncomplicated OSA based on AHI, treatment may be initiated without a titration study.28
Positive airway pressure (PAP) is the initial treatment of choice for OSA.29 If the patient is in agreeance with PAP therapy and does not have significant comorbidities, such as neuromuscular disease, cardiac disease, lung disease, chronic opiate use, or other medical conditions, then PAP therapy using automatic positive airway pressure (APAP) can be considered. Automatic positive airway pressure devices provide continuous positive airway pressure but can automatically adjust to the patient’s needs by increasing pressure when more airway resistance is detected and decreasing pressure in the presence of less airway resistance.
Alternatively, patients can undergo a titration study to determine which pressures are needed to control their sleep apnea. Once treatment is started, a compliance report from the PAP device will be generated, which provides data that includes usage time and air leakage (if present), as well as AHI, PAP settings, and other data. This information must be evaluated at follow-up appointments to ensure adherence and that the patient’s sleep apnea is controlled. Patients who have ongoing uncontrolled OSA should be referred to a sleep medicine specialist for further evaluation and treatment. If the provider is unfamiliar with the treatment for OSA, patients can be referred to a sleep medicine specialist.
For patients who fail or do not tolerate PAP therapy, second-line treatment options for OSA include mandibular advancement devices, tongue-retaining devices, and surgery for anatomical abnormalities. There is also a newly developing therapy that involves stimulation therapy using a lead that attaches to the hypoglossal nerve, which treats OSA by causing the tongue to protrude.30
Obstructive sleep apnea is an underrecognized and underdiagnosed disease with the potential for serious implications if left untreated, including cardiovascular and pulmonary complications, cognitive impairment and behavioral conditions, metabolic disease, stroke, cancer, and even death. The risk factors associated with OSA are not uncommon and include obesity, which has a critical role in the disease. Primary care providers are at the forefront of recognizing and screening at-risk patients, ordering diagnostic testing, and initiating therapy. Addressing OSA is more than just treating a disease: it is an essential part of preventative medicine, as it has the potential to prevent or reduce the burden of many other serious medical conditions.","Evan Ohlman, DMSc, PA-C"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/testing-colon-cancer/,Testing for Colon Cancer: What Are the Screening Methods You Should Know?,"Colorectal cancer (CRC), a collective term for colon and rectal cancers, is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and the fourth leading cause among women in the United States.1
However, there are ways to reduce risk for CRC — and even stop it from spreading. Screening methods are designed to detect and, in some cases, remove precancerous or cancerous growths in the body.
The American Cancer Society (ACS) and the US Preventive Services Task Force recommend that adults at average risk for CRC begin screening at 45 years of age and continue through 75 years of age.2,3


Individuals are considered at “average risk” if they do not have any of the following2:
An individual who does have any of the items listed above may be at increased risk for CRC and may need to start screening before 45 years of age.2
From 76 to 85 years of age, individuals should speak with their doctor and consider factors such as overall health, life expectancy, and screening history.2,3 Beyond 85 years of age, the ACS does not recommend further screening.2
There are 3 types of visual exams that look at the rectum and large intestine (colon) to screen for cancer.2 Colonoscopy is the gold standard for CRC screening, but, if necessary, your doctor may recommend other methods.
During a colonoscopy, a doctor inserts a tube, called a colonoscope, through the rectum and into the colon to search for abnormal growths, such as polyps, along the lining of the intestines. The doctor may also remove polyps during the procedure to prevent them from turning into cancer. The polyps may later be examined in a biopsy to confirm if cancer is present.4,5 A colonoscopy may be performed as a follow-up test to other screening methods.
Frequency: Every 10 years2
Computed tomography (CT) colonography, also referred to as “virtual colonoscopy,” uses a series of X-rays to produce computer-generated images of the colon. A doctor will examine the images for signs of precancerous or cancerous polyps. Before the procedure, you will be asked to drink a liquid with a dye that serves as contrast medium to help make the colon visible during radiation.7 In some cases, IV contrast is used instead.6 During the procedure, a doctor will insert a tube into the rectum to inflate the colon with carbon dioxide for better imaging. Then, the doctor performs CT scans to visualize the colon.5-7 A follow-up colonoscopy is necessary if the colonography finds abnormal results.9
Frequency: Every 5 years2
A doctor inserts a tube, called a sigmoidoscope, into the rectum and lower portion of the colon to look for abnormal growths of tissue, such as polyps.5 During the procedure, the doctor may also remove polyps or tissue to later examine for cancer. If precancerous polyps or cancer are detected, you will be asked to schedule a colonoscopy, since a sigmoidoscopy only examines a portion of the colon.8,9
Frequency: Every 5 years2
Unlike colonoscopy, which can help prevent CRC via precancerous polyp removal, stool tests detect CRC after it has developed. There are 3 types of stool tests, of which 2 detect blood in the stool and the third detects blood in addition to DNA biomarkers for cancer in the stool.9 Stool tests are performed at home but may need to be done more frequently than visual exams.8 For all stool tests, abnormal results require a follow-up colonoscopy visit.9
The gFOBT uses the chemical guaiac to detect blood in the stool. Before the test, your doctor may ask you to avoid consuming certain foods and drugs, which may affect test results.8,9 You will receive an at-home test kit, which contains tools and instructions on how to collect a small stool sample. Then, you mail the sample back to the doctor or laboratory, where guaiac is used to detect blood in the stool.5,10
Frequency: Every year2
The FIT uses antibodies to detect blood in the stool. You will receive an at-home test kit, which contains a collection tube or cards. You will collect a small stool sample and return it to a doctor’s office or laboratory via mail or in person. At the laboratory, a liquid is added to the stool sample and then processed in a machine containing antibodies, which detect blood in the stool.10
Frequency: Once a year2
The FIT-DNA test, or “stool DNA test,” uses both the FIT and a test that detects DNA biomarkers, or changes, in the stool from cancer or polyp cells.5,9 Using an at-home test kit, you will collect an entire stool sample and mail it back to a laboratory, where it will be analyzed for DNA alterations and blood in the stool.9,11
Frequency: Every 3 years2
Colonoscopy is performed using sedation, so you will likely sleep through the procedure.16 Most patients report discomfort with the process leading up to colonoscopy: bowel preparation. You will be instructed to take laxatives and follow a liquid diet, which will help empty the colon of all waste.4
Thoroughly cleansing stool from the colon helps the doctor clearly detect precancerous and cancerous tissue, which also decreases the need for repeat colonoscopies. A doctor may choose not to proceed with the procedure due to inadequate bowel preparation, which increases the risk for false-negative results and perforation.4
Healthy lifestyle choices can help lower your risk for CRC. Consult with your doctor about the information below:
Diet
Research shows that red meat, such as beef, lamb, or pork, and processed meats, such as sausage, hotdogs, or deli meat, are associated with an increased risk for CRC.12 In contrast, a diet high in fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, is associated with a reduced risk for CRC.13
Exercise
Regular physical activity can be beneficial. Studies show that exercise can help decrease your risk for CRC.14
Weight management
Overweight and obesity are linked to an increased risk for CRC among both men and women.15

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/metatarsus-adductus-novel-orthotic-devices/,Treating Metatarsus Adductus in Infants With Novel Orthotic Devices,"From beneath a warm swaddling of blankets, Marisa Fine had no way of knowing that her newborn son had a foot deformity. But about 2 weeks after he was born, something looked odd during bath time.
When her son was 1 month old, Marisa and her husband decided to see a clinician to get answers as to why their son’s feet appeared deformed. At their local hospital in Israel, they received a diagnosis for their son: metatarsus adductus (MTA).
MTA is a congenital condition that occurs in between 1 and 3 in 1000 births. In infants without MTA, a line that bisects the heel will also bisect the space between the second and third toe. In infants with mild MTA, the line will bisect the third toe; in moderate cases, the line will bisect the space between the third and fourth toe, and in severe cases, the line will bisect the space between the fourth and fifth toe.1
Historically, parents have had 3 treatment options to correct their child’s MTA. Since the condition in many cases self-corrects, parents are often given the option to wait and see if treatment is necessary. If MTA does not self-correct or if parents elect to initiate treatment immediately, then the child can undergo a casting process to straighten their feet or opt for wearing modified shoes or braces.
“I didn’t want to take a gamble on my child’s feet or legs,” she said. “If it doesn’t correct itself, there could be a problem later on…I wanted to be able to do something. I didn’t want to just wait and I didn’t want to do casting. I looked into it and it’s so painful for the child, it’s uncomfortable, and it’s not aesthetic… it’s just very problematic.”
Marisa and her husband sought a second opinion and they learned there was a third option for their son: Universal Neonatal Foot Orthotics (UNFO) braces, a device similar to the Wheaton™ Brace and the Bebax™ Bootie.
Not only are novel orthotic devices effective in treating MTA in children aged 10 months or younger,2 they are also more convenient for parents since they are easy to use and resemble an infant shoe, reducing social burden associated with MTA treatment.1
“The remarkable ease and simplicity in treating infants with UNFO orthotic splints introduces a new reality, allowing for the treatment of any type of MTA without age limitations and the risk of lifelong deformities,” said Izak Daizade, MD, a leading expert in orthopedic surgery with more than 30 years of experience dedicated to treating newborns, including Marisa’s son. “The considerable therapeutic success observed in extensive studies further validates this innovative approach. Comparatively, the method of treatment involving a series of casts pales in effectiveness when compared to the treatment with UNFO casts.”
Serial casting is typically completed over a 6 to 8-week span with casts changed every 2 weeks; Dr Daizade explained that this process is burdensome for infants with MTA and their parents.
“Muscles may temporarily weaken, and there may be joint stiffness after ankle and knee fixation,” Dr Daizade said. “Care must be taken to keep the cast dry during bathing, and pressure sores may develop beneath it. Swelling in the foot because of impaired blood flow and hygienic discomfort, especially with long leg casts, are common.”
Unlike casts, orthotic devices used to treat MTA operate below the ankle to allow the joint to move freely, preventing stiffness. Skin complications are less likely to occur in patients who use orthotics vs casts, as parents have the opportunity to monitor the infant’s skin daily during sock changes and bath time.
While protocol varies depending on the severity of the infant’s MTA, orthotic devices are meant to be used continuously for 6 to 8 weeks, followed by 6 to 8 weeks of nighttime use on average.3
On the first day of bracing, the device should be removed every 2 hours for 10 minutes; the brace should not be removed on the first night unless the brace causes irritation to the infant.3
The second day should follow the same pattern as the first with removal every 2 hours for 10 minutes; however, the brace can be removed after the infant’s evening bath on the second day. Over the next 12 days, the infant should wear the brace 24 hours a day except for 2 removals: once in the morning, during which the infant’s socks should be changed, and once in the evening for bath time.3
At 2 weeks, a clinician will determine optimal next steps. Typically, a second check-up occurs after 6 weeks of continuous use. At this point, the clinician will determine whether the infant still requires 24-hour therapy, or if the patient can switch to 15-hour overnight therapy. A third check-up should take place after 3 weeks of 15-hour overnight therapy; at this time, the clinician will determine if the patient can switch to 12-hour overnight therapy. After 3 weeks of 12-hour overnight therapy, a fourth check-up should take place to determine if the brace is no longer needed.3
If a parent or clinician observes regression at any point in the process, resumption of 24-hour therapy should be considered.3
Dr Daizade is hopeful that patients around the world will benefit from access to orthotic devices to treat MTA. So far in the United States, patients in Miami and Baltimore have been successfully treated with the device.
With increased awareness of the condition and noninvasive treatment options available, Marisa hopes that more infants will have positive outcomes like her son.
“These children, they don’t need to suffer,” Marisa said. “They don’t need to have these uncomfortable casts that can be so traumatizing when they’re little and there’s a better option out there and it doesn’t hurt. It’s not invasive and it’s easy to use. Why would you have your child go through that if they don’t have to?”",Michelle Falci
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/biden-administration-higher-staffing-mandates/,Biden Administration Sets Higher Staffing Mandates,"Kaiser Health News — The Biden administration finalized nursing home staffing rules Monday that will require thousands of them to hire more nurses and aides — while giving them years to do so.
The new rules from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) are the most substantial changes to federal oversight of the nation’s roughly 15,000 nursing homes in more than 3 decades. But they are less stringent than what patient advocates said was needed to provide high-quality care.
Spurred by disproportionate deaths from COVID-19 in long-term care facilities, the rules aim to address perennially sparse staffing that can be a root cause of missed diagnoses, severe bedsores, and frequent falls.
“For residents, this will mean more staff, which means fewer ER visits potentially, more independence,” Vice President Kamala Harris said while meeting with nursing home workers in La Crosse, Wisconsin. “For families, it’s going to mean peace of mind in terms of your loved one being taken care of.”
When the regulations are fully enacted, 4 in 5 homes will need to augment their payrolls, CMS estimated. But the new standards are likely to require slight if any improvements for many of the 1.2 million residents in facilities that are already quite close to or meet the minimum levels.
“Historically, this is a big deal, and we’re glad we have now established a floor,” Blanca Castro, California’s long-term care ombudsman, said in an interview. “From here we can go upward, recognizing there will be a lot of complaints about where we are going to get more people to fill these positions.”
The rules primarily address staffing levels for 3 types of nursing home workers. Registered nurses, or RNs, are the most skilled and responsible for guiding overall care and setting treatment plans. Licensed practical nurses, sometimes called licensed vocational nurses, work under the direction of RNs and perform routine medical care such as taking vital signs. Certified nursing assistants are supposed to be the most plentiful and help residents with daily activities like going to the bathroom, getting dressed, and eating.
While the industry has increased wages by 27% since February 2020, homes say they are still struggling to compete against better-paying work for nurses at hospitals and at retail shops and restaurants for aides. On average, nursing home RNs earn $40 an hour, licensed practical nurses make $31 an hour, and nursing assistants are paid $19 an hour, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
CMS estimated the rules will ultimately cost $6 billion annually, but the plan omits any more payments from Medicare or Medicaid, the public insurers that cover most residents’ stays — meaning additional wages would have to come out of owners’ pockets or existing facility budgets.
The American Health Care Association, which represents the nursing home industry, called the regulation “an unreasonable standard” that “creates an impossible task for providers” amid a persistent worker shortage nationwide.
“This unfunded mandate doesn’t magically solve the nursing crisis,” the association’s CEO, Mark Parkinson, said in a statement. Parkinson said the industry will keep pressing Congress to overturn the regulation.
Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a New York City-based advocacy nonprofit, said “it is hard to call this a win for nursing home residents and families” given that the minimum levels were below what studies have found to be ideal.
The plan was welcomed by labor unions that represent nurses — and whom President Joe Biden is counting on for support in his reelection campaign. Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry called it a “long-overdue sea change.” This political bond was underscored by the administration’s decision to have Harris announce the rule with SEIU members in Wisconsin, a swing state.
The new rules supplant the vague federal mandate that has been in place since the 1980s requiring nursing homes to have “sufficient” staffing to meet residents’ needs. In practice, inspectors rarely categorized inadequate staffing as a serious infraction resulting in possible penalties, federal records show.
Starting in 2 years, most homes must provide an average of at least 3.48 hours of daily care per resident. About 6 in 10 nursing homes are already operating at that level, a KFF analysis found.
The rules give homes breathing room before they must comply with more specific requirements. Within 3 years, most nursing homes will need to provide daily RN care of at least 0.55 hours per resident and 2.45 hours from aides.
CMS also mandated that within 2 years an RN must be on duty at all times in case of a patient crisis on weekends or overnight. Currently, CMS requires at least 8 consecutive hours of RN presence each day and a licensed nurse of any level on duty around the clock. An inspector general report found that nearly a 1000 nursing homes didn’t meet those basic requirements.
Nursing homes in rural areas will have longer to staff up. Within 3 years, they must meet the overall staffing numbers and the round-the-clock RN requirement. CMS’ rule said rural homes have four years to achieve the RN and nurse aide thresholds, although there was some confusion within CMS, as its press materials said rural homes would have 5 years.
Under the new rules, the average nursing home, which has around 100 residents, would need to have at least 2 RNs working each day, and at least 10 or 11 nurse aides, the administration said. Homes could meet the overall requirements through 2 more workers, who could be RNs, vocational nurses, or aides.
Homes can get a hardship exemption from the minimums if they are in regions with low populations of nurses or aides and demonstrate good-faith efforts to recruit.
Democrats praised the rules, though some said the administration did not go nearly far enough. Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, said the changes were “modest improvements” but that “much more is needed to ensure sufficient care and resident safety.” A Republican senator from Nebraska, Deb Fischer, said the rule would “devastate nursing homes across the country and worsen the staffing shortages we are already facing.”
Advocates for nursing home residents have been pressing CMS for years to adopt a higher standard than what it ultimately settled on. A CMS-commissioned study in 2001 found that the quality of care improved with increases of staff up to a level of 4.1 hours per resident per day — nearly a fifth higher than what CMS will require. The consultants CMS hired in preparing its new rules did not incorporate the earlier findings in their evaluation of options.
CMS said the levels it endorsed were more financially feasible for homes, but that assertion didn’t quiet the ongoing battle about how many people are willing to work in homes at current wages and how financially strained homes owners actually are.
“If states do not increase Medicaid payments to nursing homes, facilities are going to close,” said John Bowblis, PhD, an economics professor and research fellow with the Scripps Gerontology Center at Miami University. “There aren’t enough workers and there are shortages everywhere. When you have a 3% to 4% unemployment rate, where are you going to get people to work in nursing homes?”
Researchers, however, have been skeptical that all nursing homes are as broke as the industry claims or as their books show. A study published in March by the National Bureau of Economic Research estimated that 63% of profits were secretly siphoned to owners through inflated rents and other fees paid to other companies owned by the nursing homes’ investors.
Charlene Harrington, a professor emeritus at the nursing school of the University of California-San Francisco, said: “In their unchecked quest for profits, the nursing home industry has created its own problems by not paying adequate wages and benefits and setting heavy nursing workloads that cause neglect and harm to residents and create an unsatisfactory and stressful work environment.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/wildfire-smoke-health-effects-relationship-cardiovascular-disease/,"Wildfire Smoke, Health Effects, and the Relationship With Cardiovascular Disease","Consistent evidence supports a link between exposure to wildfire smoke and increased pulmonary morbidity, with multiple studies showing associations between levels of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) from wildfires and rates of hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory illnesses such as acute bronchitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.1-3 Additionally, some studies have demonstrated associations between exposure to wildfire smoke and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).
“Emerging data suggests that wildfire smoke exposure increases cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and cardiovascular hospitalizations, and elderly patients and patients with underlying comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and respiratory conditions seem to be more susceptible,” explained American Heart Association (AHA) volunteer Sanjay Rajagopalan, MD, FACC, FAHA, chief of cardiovascular medicine and chief academic and scientific officer at University Hospitals Harrington Heart and Vascular Institute in Cleveland, Ohio. “The chemical composition of wildfire smoke suggests that it may be even more toxic than traditional fossil fuel-based emissions.”4
In a study published in 2022 in Geohealth, stratified analyses showed an increase in unscheduled hospital visits in California for all CVDs, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure among non‐Hispanic White patients and patients older than 65 years on days with the highest concentrations of PM2.5 from wildfires. The study authors also reported that higher temperatures may interact with wildfire-derived PM2.5 and further increase hospital visits for CVD among individuals with pre-existing heart disease.1
Another California-based study observed higher rates of ED visits for various CV events, including myocardial infarction (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09-1.84), ischemic heart disease (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01-1.47), and heart failure (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.10-1.35) on days with dense smoke, with the highest rates found among adults aged 65 years and older.5
In other studies, the risk for out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest increased on days with heavy smoke due to California wildfires, and elevated levels of PM2.5 from Colorado wildfires were associated with increased rates of CVD hospitalization and CV mortality (OR, 1.478; 95% CI, 1.12–1.94).6,2
In a study published in 2022, post-wildfire physician visits among older adults increased by 11% (95% CI, 3%-21%) for congestive heart failure and 19% (95% CI, 7%-33%) for ischemic heart disease, and patients with diabetes demonstrated a higher risk for CV morbidity (relative risk [RR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01-1.46) and respiratory morbidity (RR , 1.35; 95% CI, 1.09-1.67) following wildfires in Calgary, Canada.7
Other recent research suggests a slight increase in the risk of CV mortality associated with wildfire smoke, with 2 studies showing that 0.55 and 0.56 of CV deaths were attributable to wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure during each study period.8,9
Overall, however, findings regarding the connection between wildfire smoke and CV outcomes are mixed.2 “While some studies have indicated an uptick in emergency room admissions for CVD post-wildfire, others have not,” noted Julio Lamprea Montealegre, MD, PhD, MPH, clinical instructor in the division of cardiology at the University of California San Francisco. “The specific types of cardiovascular events that are most likely affected by wildfire exposure also remain unclear.”
Although further research is needed to elucidate the relationship between CVD and wildfire smoke exposure, wildfire-related CV events may become more prevalent with the potential intensification of wildfires in the coming years, according to Dr Rajagopalan and Dr Montealegre. This possibility highlights the need for increased awareness and preparation among patients, providers, and health systems.
“Awareness is the first prerequisite for appropriate intervention, and the association between cardiovascular events and wildfire smoke needs to be widely promulgated amongst health care personnel,” Dr Rajagopalan said. Patient awareness of neighborhood air pollution levels during wildfire episodes is also important. Higher-risk patients, such as the elderly and those with prior CV or respiratory conditions, should be educated about protective measures, he advised.
“The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set forth recommendations to mitigate exposure to particle pollution, particularly for vulnerable groups including those with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases,” Dr Montealegre stated. “Recommendations encompass both indoor and outdoor measures, such as employing portable air cleaners and limiting outdoor activities during times when the Air Quality Index (AQI) indicates unhealthy levels.”10 Patients and providers can check AirNow.gov to monitor daily AQI forecasts.
As roughly 67% of exposure to PM2.5 from outdoor origins occurs inside the home due to infiltration of outdoor pollutants, efforts to improve indoor air quality are essential in reducing wildfire smoke exposure and related health risks.11
In a review published in 2022 in Circulation, Hadley et al recommended various measures to reduce wildfire smoke exposure and the associated CV impact in affected areas.12 On the individual level, for example, they recommend the use of particle respirators such as N95 masks among vulnerable patients.12
In the health care setting, they recommend that clinicians ensure the aggressive management of traditional CVD risk factors and optimization of medical therapy among at-risk patients prior to the start of each fire season.12
More broadly, they recommend that health care facilities strive for cleaner indoor air and that health systems “make preparations for wildfire season to protect their susceptible patients and avoid shortfalls in beds, supplies, human resources, and key partnerships,” as described in the paper.12
Dr Montealegre emphasized the crucial need for a deeper dive into research aimed at elucidating the CV consequences of wildfire smoke. “Priorities include enhanced exposure science that offers a precise evaluation of individual exposure levels, rigorous mechanistic studies elucidating the connection between pollutants from wildfire smoke and cardiovascular repercussions, and clinical trials assessing the efficacy of mitigation techniques such as air filters in curtailing cardiovascular events,” he said.
Beyond efforts to mitigate the adverse health effects of wildfire smoke in high-risk individuals, the most important broader measures needed in this area are “steps to prevent climate change, which include ongoing efforts at decarbonizing our economy and uncoupling CO2 emissions from economic activity,” Dr Rajagopalan stated. “In this regard, movement to a fossil fuel-free future is not only eminently possible, but may also be associated with better health, better economies, and hopefully better climate in the not-too-distant future.”

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/autism-checklist/,Autism Checklist: How to Prepare for Your First Diagnostic Evaluation,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by ongoing problems with social communication, social interaction, and restricted, repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities.1,2 While an experienced clinician can reliably identify ASD in children as young as age 2 years, many children do not receive the diagnosis until they are much older, which delays effective treatment.3 Parents may be able to spot signs and symptoms of ASD very early in their child’s life, which can lead to earlier evaluation and treatment. This article describes what you should do to prepare for the initial evaluation if you suspect your child may have ASD, or if you think you might have ASD.
In the United States, approximately 1 in every 36 children aged 8 years is estimated to have ASD.4 Boys are approximately 4 times as likely to be diagnosed with ASD than girls.4 Because ASD is a lifelong condition, an estimated 2.2% of U.S. adults (approximately 5.4 million people aged 18 years and older) are living with ASD.5
Autism spectrum disorder can be diagnosed at any age.6 Symptoms of ASD are generally identified when a child is aged 12 to 24 months, though they may appear earlier than 12 months if severe, or later than 24 months if subtle.1 Parents or caregivers may be able to notice early signs of ASD before their child is 1 year old.2
Typical early symptoms of ASD include1:
The 2 types of symptoms of ASD are difficulties with social communication/interactions and restricted, repetitive behavior, interests, or activities.1
Specific social communication/interactions problems include avoiding eye contact, having difficulty using nonverbal gestures, using stilted or scripted speech, interpreting abstract ideas literally, having trouble recognizing one’s own emotions as well as the emotions of other people, and having difficulty making or keeping friends.2
A child who shows restricted interests is extremely focused on a specific subject to the exclusion of other subjects and expects others to be just as interested in that subject.2 A child with ASD has inflexible behavior and extreme difficulty dealing with change, particularly changes in routine or participating in new experiences.2 Repetitive behaviors might include movements such as hand flapping, rocking, or spinning, being hypersensitive to stimuli such as loud noises, and arranging toys or other items in a very particular pattern.1,2
Studies have shown that, with rare exceptions, a child with ASD will experience deterioration in their social and communication behaviors over the first 2 years of life. During the second year of life (aged 12 to 24 months) repetitive behaviors and abnormal play typically become more obvious. A small number of patients with ASD experience these behavioral declines in adolescence. Some people with ASD may not seek an evaluation for ASD until they are an adult, possibly prompted by an ASD diagnosis in a child in their family.1,2
While parents can informally assess their child for signs and symptoms of ASD, they also can use tools designed for that purpose. While these tools generally are intended to be used by clinicians, they rely at least in part on input from parents, so parents may find it helpful to explore them before their child is evaluated by a specialist.
The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT-R; available at www.mchatscreen.com) is a screening tool intended to be used by primary care providers, specialists, or other professionals to determine a child’s risk for ASD.7 It consists of 2 parts: the M-CHAT-R and the M-CHAT-R Follow-up (M-CHAT-R/F).
The M-CHAT-R consists of 20 yes/no questions about how a child usually behaves. Scoring of the M-CHAT-R is interpreted as follows7:
If a child screens positive on the M-CHAT-R, a clinician should administer the M-CHAT-R/F, which consists of 20 pass/fail questions and detailed instructions for how to interpret the results.7 Because the goal of the M-CHAT-R is to detect as many cases of ASD as possible, it has a high rate of false positives, which means that not every child whose M-CHAT-R results suggest they are at risk for ASD will be diagnosed with the disorder.7 However, children who screen positive on the M-CHAT-R are at risk for other developmental disorders and should be evaluated by an experienced clinician.7
In addition to M-CHAT, several other tools that include input from parents can be used to screen children for development delays that might suggest a diagnosis of ASD3:
Screening tools such as these are used to help identify a child who might have a neurodevelopmental delay such as ASD, but they do not provide conclusive evidence of a delay and they do not establish a diagnosis.3 Parents who thinks their child might have ASD should express their concerns to their child’s pediatrician. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians conduct general developmental screening of all children at 9, 18, and 30 months of age, and screening specifically for symptoms of ASD at 18 and 24 months.8 If necessary, the pediatrician will refer parents to a specialist who will conduct a thorough evaluation using the appropriate diagnostic criteria.
In order to receive a diagnosis of ASD, a child needs to meet the criteria established by the American Psychiatric Association and published in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision.1 Those criteria can be summarized as follows1:
A. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction as manifested by all of the following:
B. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least 2 of the following:
To meet these criteria, a child must not only have the required number of symptoms but the symptoms must have been apparent early in the child’s developmental period and must cause significant impairment in functioning.1 These symptoms must not be better explained by an intellectual disability or global developmental delay.1
To best help a child who they suspect might have ASD, parents can be better informed about the condition and diagnosis. Some checklist items for parents to address include:
An adolescent or adult who suspects they may have ASD can follow a similar checklist:

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/cdc-acip-recommends-updates-pediatric-immunization-schedule/,"CDC Vaccine Update: Meningococcal Disease, Polio, Chikungunya, and H influenzae","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) addressed new initiatives and voted on several vaccine recommendations in their first 2024 meeting, held from February 28 to 29.
The ACIP discussed several vaccines during the 2-day meeting, including those for protection against COVID-19, Chikungunya, diphtheria and tetanus (DT), Hemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), polio, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), meningococcal disease, and pneumococcal disease. The updated recommendations for vaccination against COVID-19, RSV, and pneumococcal disease are available here.
The DT vaccine, which was previously recommended for children younger than 7 years with a contraindication to pertussis-containing vaccines, has been discontinued in the United States. The ACIP now recommends the tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine for this group, particularly in those who develop encephalopathy within 7 days of DT vaccination.1 Current guidelines indicate the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine as the first dose in the vaccination series. Children aged 7 years and older with contraindications may now receive Td for all remaining doses. Although it remains a viable option, the Td vaccine contains a lower dose of diphtheria toxoid, suggesting a decrease in its efficacy.
The ACIP approved the vaccines for children resolution for coverage of the Td vaccine in children younger than 7 years who have contraindications to pertussis-containing vaccines.2 This update is anticipated to be included in the recommended immunization schedule. Guidelines regarding the administration of a single booster dose of the Tdap vaccine among children aged between 11 and 12 years remain unchanged.
The meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenABCWY), a pentavalent formulation from Pfizer®, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2023. The ACIP now recommends the MenABCWY vaccine among children and adolescents for whom both the MenACWY and MenB vaccines are indicated at a single visit. The approval of the MenABCWY vaccine provides multiple options for revising the meningococcal vaccine schedule, including the elimination of a MenACWY vaccine dose in children aged 11 to 12 years and a change in the recommended age group for MenB vaccination to increase protection at the time of college entry.
Evidence suggests that college-aged students have a 3.5-fold higher risk for serogroup B disease than noncollege-aged students, with disease incidence peaking at 19 years of age and declining after 20 years of age.3 According to the ACIP, “Revisions to the schedule should optimize protection against meningitis.” They also noted that the approval of a pentavalent formulation will serve to lower the number of injections needed for protection against meningococcal disease.

The ACIP proposed several options to consider for revising the recommended meningococcal vaccine schedule, as shown in the table:3
There is ongoing discussion regarding these 4 options as the ACIP noted that the existing vaccination platform took years to implement and any revisions to the schedule may affect school requirements.
Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. The Chikungunya vaccine (IXCHIQ) was licensed in the US by the FDA in November 2023 for use among individuals at risk for exposure to the virus, including travelers, laboratory workers, and those residing in areas with increased transmission risk. The vaccine is available as a single-dose primary schedule for individuals aged 18 years and older.4
The ACIP recommends the vaccine for adults traveling to a country or territory where there has been an outbreak of Chikungunya.2
However, the vaccine may be considered for the following individuals in the event of planned travel to a country or territory where there is no outbreak but where substantial evidence of transmission has occurred within the past 5 years:2
In regard to laboratory workers, the ACIP recommends Chikungunya vaccination for those whose research or diagnostic work involves the use of live viruses. The ACIP noted that the virus is primarily transmitted through aerosol, as well as percutaneous and possibly mucosal routes.2
Individuals who are pregnant should avoid exposure to Chikungunya.6 The ACIP noted that Chikungunya vaccination should be deferred until after delivery but may be considered for individuals at increased risk for exposure. However, they recommend against vaccination during the first trimester as well as after 36 weeks’ gestation.
The ACIP considered modifying the polio vaccine schedule for US children who have been vaccinated against polio in other countries. Six countries (Bangladesh, Cuba, Ecuador, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) include fractional inactivated polio virus (fIPV) vaccination in recommended routine childhood immunization schedules.8
According to the ACIP, 2 fIPV doses are considered valid and counted as one full intramuscular dose of IPV with respect to the US schedule. However, 1 fIPV dose is not considered a viable alternative to 1 IPV dose.8
Guidelines regarding children who have been vaccinated against polio in the US remain unchanged.
There are ongoing discussions regarding the expansion of Hib vaccine recommendations for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) infants. Guidelines suggest the use of PedvaxHIB® (Hemophilus b conjugate vaccine) for AI/AN infants. However, the emergence of combination vaccines, such as Vaxelis®, may expand options for this population.
Vaxelis, initially licensed by the FDA in December 2018, is a hexavalent vaccine comprising DTaP, inactivated polio, Hemophilus influenzae type B conjugate, and hepatitis B virus vaccine formulations. Similar to PedvaxHIB, Vaxelis contains Hib conjugate at a lower dose.7 Combination vaccines provide an opportunity for fewer shots, reduce the risk for missed doses, and lower the burden of vaccine administration. Results of a phase 4 trial conducted among AI/AN infants (N=333) showed that Vaxelis was noninferior to PedvaxHIB with respect to Hib antibody levels 30 days following receipt of the first vaccine dose.8
Members of the ACIP will vote on additional vaccine recommendations at their next scheduled meeting in June of 2024.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/seasonal-allergies-and-mental-health-sleep-disorders/,Seasonal Allergies Often Accompanied by Mental Health and Sleep Disorders,"Now that spring in the air, so is allergic rhinitis, with many affected patients streaming into clinician offices for relief. Yet for some patients, that need for relief goes beyond alleviating sneezes, itchy eyes, and stuffed noses. A growing body of research indicates a significant connection between allergies and mental health,1 especially among women.2
Not only do allergies potentially worsen mood disorders, but the stress and anxiety from mood disorders can, in turn, amp up allergic responses. “Depression in and of itself is thought to be a pro-inflammatory state,” says David Gudis, MD, chief of the division of rhinology and anterior skull base surgery at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City. “If your inflammatory mechanisms are already firing, and then you throw an allergic reaction on top of it, you’re propelling that allergic reaction to an even greater degree. Dealing with these challenges can deplete your resilience, leaving you less equipped to handle the ways in which allergies might worsen your condition.”
Seasonal allergies, in particular, have been linked to generalized anxiety.1 This is “no surprise to most practicing allergists,” says Ron Saff, MD, a practicing allergist and assistant professor of medicine at Florida State University College of Medicine in Tallahassee, FL. Allergy season typically worsens allergy-related conditions, such as asthma and urticaria, he notes, which adds to patients’ stress levels. “Many patients usually do well with their allergic rhinitis symptoms throughout the rest of the year, but when the spring rolls around and the trees start pollinating, they come in with sneezing and runny noses and watery eyes, and many of them just don’t feel well. It seems like I see more of everything in the spring,” says Dr Saff.
Clinicians and patients alike need to be more aware of the potential for connection between seasonal allergies and mental health, so that patients’ needs can be fully addressed, Drs Saff and Gudis both stress. This is especially true given that allergy seasons are not only starting earlier but are also lasting longer and hitting harder; a 2020 study highlighted a 21% rise in pollen levels across North America between 1990 and 2018.3
“For at least 75 years, doctors have identified and written about the association between depression and anxiety and allergic rhinitis,” says Dr Gudis. “It’s been studied in different ways, using different scientific methodologies of investigation around the world. The reason that’s important is that allergens are different in different parts of the world — meaning this is not unique to a reaction to a specific allergen. It’s related more to the cascade of the inflammatory pathways that occur in the body during the allergic reaction.”4
Research delving into how our bodies react to allergens, such as tree pollen, shows a complex inflammatory response that transcends the initial point of contact. Upon encountering tree pollen, for instance, the nasal membranes react to these perceived microscopic invaders, fueling a reaction that travels through the airways and spreads through the body and brain.5
At the heart of this inflammatory response are cytokines, crucial chemical messengers that orchestrate the response.6 Pro-inflammatory cytokines can penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) and interact with critical neurological processes, thus influencing important brain functions, including how brain cells communicate, hormone regulation, and behaviors associated with mental health conditions like depression and anxiety.7
In severe allergic rhinitis, many of the physical symptoms that cause physical misery can also have a major effect on a patient’s mood.  “Any illness or disorder, if it detracts from the enjoyment of the world around us, is a psychological stressor, and allergic rhinitis8 is no different,” says Dr Gudis. “Basically, the whole middle of their head is inflamed, impacting memory, attention, and fatigue,” Dr Gudis adds.
The nasal congestion of allergic rhinitis in itself can have a major impact on mood, he stresses. “We don’t even realize it but our sense of smell helps us connect to people around us,” Dr Gudis says. “When people have olfactory dysfunction, as a result of their noses being swollen and inflamed, they are more likely to feel depressed9 and isolated,” he says.
This relationship was underlined by a 2016 study revealing a strong link between compromised olfactory function and depression.10 Of note, people who are depressed frequently have a diminished sense of smell compared to those who aren’t depressed. Moreover, individuals with a weaker sense of smell tend to be more prone to depression, especially if they’ve completely lost their ability to smell.
A growing body of research points to how inflammation from seasonal allergies can disrupt sleep,11 a major factor connecting allergic suffering to mood disorders, adds Dr Gudis.
A 2020 meta-analysis on the association between allergic rhinitis and sleep patterns found that although there is not a significant difference in sleep duration between people with and without allergic rhinitis, the condition was linked to poorer sleep quality, increased sleep disturbances, longer sleep latency, heightened usage of sleep medications, and lower sleep efficiency.11 Moreover, hay fever sufferers experience other sleep ailments, including insomnia, restless sleep, and obstructive sleep apnea, alongside daytime dysfunction, such as difficulty waking up and daytime sleepiness.
“When people have allergic rhinitis, one thing they experience is sleep dysfunction,” says Dr Gudis. “Allergic rhinitis, fundamentally, is defined by its underlying mechanism — its pathophysiology.” The inflammatory cytokines involved can disrupt normal and healthy sleep and increase fatigue, he explains.
“There’s a shorter sleep duration… [and] a disruption of the normal sleep function and architecture.” Adequate sleep is critical to mental health, notes Dr Gudis, adding that research indicates that poor sleep “exacerbates symptoms of depression and anxiety.”
Some commonly used allergy medications can potentially worsen mental health conditions as well, says Dr Saff. While allergists are well-aware of this, patients and primary care providers often are not.
Older-generation decongestants present in antihistamines like those found in doxylamine or diphenhydramine can induce sedation12 and a feeling of disorientation. Pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine can cause anxiety, nervousness and insomnia13 without effectively treating allergic rhinitis.
Additionally, research suggests a connection between anticholinergics12 — such as Benadryl — and an increased risk of dementia in older adults.
“Benadryl [diphenhydramine] is frequently utilized in the emergency department,” says Saff. “And patients are frequently sent home on Benadryl, so I think there’s certainly a lack of knowledge about the side effects of first-generation antihistamines.”
Additionally, Dr Saff notes that many patients resort to self-medication with these drugs before seeing him, often reporting adverse effects like drowsiness or ineffectiveness.
Dr Saff recommends that patients who wish to self-medicate use over-the-counter nasal steroids and antihistamines as safer alternatives, citing their minimal systemic absorption14 and fewer side effects. A protocol can be started before allergy season15 for more effective symptom management. Allergy eye drops also provide targeted relief without the systemic side effects associated with oral medications.16
Second-generation antihistamines in pill form, such as cetirizine,  fexofenadine, and loratadine, are still a good choice for many, says Dr Gudis, as they cause less drowsiness than the first-generation drugs and last longer. Allegra is considered the least sedating of this group.17
Moreover, decongestants like oxymetazoline are useful for symptom relief but can have a rebound effect over a prolonged time. After a few days of using decongestants, the blood vessels in the nose become less responsive to the medication, reducing their effectiveness.
For patients seeking a medication-free option, Dr Saff suggests nasal irrigation — a time-tested, research-backed method using a saline solution to clear nasal passages.18 He recommends intranasal sodium chloride products over traditional neti pots for their ease of use and effectiveness.
Many patients suffering with allergies who are also experiencing mood disorders may not be aware that the 2 problems could be connected, said Dr Gudis. “Patients might not realize they should mention changes in their mood to their ear nose and throat specialist, allergist, or pulmonologist,” he notes. Given that, clinicians seeing allergy patients may want to open up this line of communication.
Dr Saff agrees. Although it is commonly assumed that depression screening is the responsibility of primary care providers, many patients — especially those without a regular primary care physician or detailed medical records — might miss crucial mental health screenings.
The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) mental health screening recommendations are useful guidelines for identifying and addressing depression, says Dr Saff, who advocates for their broader use across specialties. Dr Saff says he employs a holistic approach for those struggling with anxiety and depression, recommending reading materials, counseling, and exercise. When appropriate, he may also prescribe medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.18
As a practicing allergist in a college town, Dr. Saff often sees students who are under stress, separated from their usual support networks, and who don’t have a local primary care physician.  Getting an appointment with a mental health professional sometimes can take months for these students, he notes. “They need help and I’m happy to offer them the medication,” he adds. “Many take me up on the offer.” When they do, he has them come back for reassessment after a month. Many students will instead choose to contact their primary care physician in their hometown, consult another provider, or to just live with the stress. “It’s always the patient’s choice,” says Dr Saff.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/moving-needle-quality-health-outcomes-children/,"Daniel Crawford, DNP: Moving the Needle on Quality Health Outcomes for Children: Q&A","Meet Daniel Crawford, DNP, ARNP, CPNP-PC, CNE, FAANP, Associate Dean for Graduate Practice Programs and Associate Professor at the University of Iowa College of Nursing, in Iowa City. He is president-elect of the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (NAPNAP), which recently help their 2024 annual meeting in Denver, Colorado. Dr Crawford also maintains a clinical practice at the University of Iowa Stead Family Children’s Hospital, Division of Pediatric Neurology. The Clinical Advisor met with Dr Crawford to discuss the challenges facing the field of pediatric nurse practitioners.
Dr Crawford: The biggest challenges facing NAPNAP are tied to the biggest challenges facing pediatric health care. From NAPNAP’s origins over 50 years ago, pediatric nurse practitioners (PNP) have had a unique mission to meet the needs of underserved and rural populations by delivering the highest quality of health care possible. To deliver high-quality health care that is equitably available continues to be an important challenge and I believe that PNPs serve a unique role in meeting that demand in our communities.
We are now recognized as providing quality, efficiency, and advocacy for our patients. We are seeing new roles, new ideas, and new ways that we’re contributing to make a difference and move the needle on quality health outcomes for children.
My goal as NAPNAP president will be to combine these. Over the past year, I was able to co-lead our strategic planning task force. In creating a strategic plan, we realized where we are and where we need to be as an organization. We saw that there was a lot that we had to envision, which took us back to re-writing our mission statement and vision for the organization.
The vision statement says: “All infants, children, adolescents, and young adults receive equitable, high-quality pediatric health care.” Our mission is “to optimize the health and wellbeing of all infants, children, adolescents, and young adults, and empower our community of pediatric experts.”
My goal is to transition towards this new strategic plan and work with our staff and our leadership to continue to do the things we’re doing well, but also areas that maybe we need to allocate our time, effort, and resources to advance what we hope to be in the future as an organization.
Dr Crawford: The shortage [of primary care providers] cuts across all types of patients, including pediatric patients. In my state of Iowa, a significant amount of primary care services are provided by nurse practitioners and we are not the only state where that is the case.
There is not enough training capacity for nurse practitioners to meet the demand. There are a lot of plans underway and things that are being developed and designed to hopefully address this moving forward. We continue to turn out high-quality graduates in PNP programs across the country, and we know that our physician counterparts continue to do the same, but at the end of the day, there is still a shortage.
Dr Crawford: We need to fix the Federal allocations for health care training so that we can increase the number of NPs in our programs but unfortunately things move slowly . When you look at pediatrics in particular, we know there is a shortfall in PNPs and this is a missed opportunity. My graduate program can admit twice the number of NPs but we lack the funding to pay for extra trainers; we don’t have the Federal funding needed for NP education.
We are also thinking about the undergraduate pipeline. We engage students early on their nursing pathway by meeting with incoming freshmen. I am presenting to  high school students who have been admitted to the College of Nursing to discuss what an advanced practice nursing career looks like. This includes what the educational pathway looks like beyond nursing school, and what kind of things are going to help support them in that process. We encourage undergraduate students who are curious about graduate degrees to start building a mentorship relationship in nursing school.
We must realize the geographic diversity of our nurse practitioner programs and our institutions that are representative of the populations we serve. A school in Chicago will have a different makeup from a school in Iowa, which is a predominantly rural state.
Our student cohorts should be reflective of the communities in which they serve. There’s a body of evidence that shows that outcomes are better when providers reflect their patient population. In Iowa, nurse practitioners who are from rural communities return to their communities at a high rate after graduation. We can graduate somebody to go back to that community and establish a pediatric primary care practice and become an individual who is uniquely positioned to affect the lives of the children in that community. At the end of the day, we are about providing high-quality pediatric outcomes for all children.
Dr. Crawford: After nursing school, I knew what I liked and what I did not like. I joined a practice and we created a pretty unique model that I would say rivals some of the fellowship models for transition to practice with nurse practitioners. I knew I liked neurology. I knew I liked the people in the practice, and I knew that this model sounded like a really good way for me to continue to grow professionally. I spent my first few years of practice in general neurology seeing the full spectrum of neurologic disorders.
Sometimes life throws you unexpected curveballs and around that time my daughter was diagnosed with epilepsy.  I was then  the parent with a child with epilepsy and I got to experience what that experience looks like from the parent side. That enabled me as a PNP to not only better meet the needs of the child with epilepsy but also the family. We know that the family unit is an important part of the overall health of the child. It was an opportunity to reflect and to grow in ways that I never anticipated professionally. Thankfully, my daughter’s treatment was effective and she outgrew her seizures.
Dr Crawford: When I was offered this position, I said that I would only take it as long as I could keep my practice. My practice and clinic hours are such an important part of me. My administrative role involves a lot of meetings and strategies about a lot of complicated topics. When I go to the clinic every Thursday morning, it’s my time to spend with kids, play games, and have fun. I get to work with families on managing their child’s epilepsy and just see how life is going for them.",Nikki Kean
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/autism-statistics-prevalence/,Autism Statistics and Prevalence,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication/interaction and restricted, repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities that cause significant impairment in functioning.1,2 The terminology and diagnostic criteria of ASD have changed several times since the disorder was first described in 1943, which has made it challenging to standardize research and identification.3 Yet in recent years, the prevalence of ASD has been markedly increasing, and the demographics of those diagnosed with ASD has been changing.1 Understanding the basic facts about ASD and the latest statistics and trends is essential for identifying patients early and providing them with optimal care.
Although researchers have not identified a single, unifying cause of ASD, it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors that affect the developing brain.4,5
Limited evidence suggests individuals with ASD have anatomical changes in the layers of their cortex. Patients with ASD exhibit differences in limbic areas involved in fear and emotional regulation, such as the amygdala. The brains of individuals with ASD frequently have “overgrowth” of their cortical areas and increased cerebral spinal fluid. They also have changes in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission and signs of abnormal cellular differentiation.4 Extensive evidence has demonstrated that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and other childhood vaccines do not cause ASD.5
Many risk factors are associated with developing ASD. Older maternal and paternal age have each been associated with an increased risk of ASD.4
The use of certain medications during pregnancy has also been associated with the risk of having a child with ASD. Maternal antidepressant use — specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors — during the second or third trimester has been associated with an increased risk of ASD, even after adjusting for maternal depression.6 Prenatal use of thalidomide and valproic acid also have been linked to an increased risk of ASD in offspring.4 Conversely, taking prenatal folic acid while also taking an antiepileptic medication might decrease the risk of ASD.4
Genetics may play a role in ASD risk. Siblings of a person with ASD have a higher chance of developing the disorder.4 One monozygotic twin have a higher chance of developing ASD if the other twin has it. Several chromosome-linked disorders, including Fragile-X and Down syndrome, have also been associated with the occurrence of ASD.4,7
The current American Psychiatric Association diagnostic criteria for ASD are published in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision.2 Those criteria include 2 primary categories of symptoms: deficits in social communication/social interaction, and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.2
Many people with ASD have atypical social behaviors. They may have impaired verbal and nonverbal communication, as well as difficulty making friends and maintaining relationships.2,7 Individuals with ASD tend to avoid eye contact and have difficulty interpreting normal social cues.7 They have trouble understanding implications or hidden meanings and engaging in the back-and-forth of a conversation.
Repetitive behaviors commonly exhibited by people with ASD include the following2:
Behaviors associated with ASD also may include a strong preoccupation with minute details or obsessions with certain topics or objects, such as a type of toy. Lining up objects in a specific manner or order can be a characteristic behavior of ASD.2,8
Individuals with ASD may be hyperreactive or hyporeactive to sensory input. They may be uncomfortable or upset by certain sounds. They may also display high sensitivity to certain types of visual or tactile stimuli, such as textures, lights, or movement.2,8
For an individual to receive an ASD diagnosis, their symptoms need to significantly impair their functioning. This could include their ability to focus at school, communicate with others, or hold a job and live independently.2,8
Autism spectrum disorder can co-occur with many other conditions, particularly neurological or psychiatric conditions.4 Approximately 37% of children with ASD also have an intellectual disability.9 Psychiatric disorders such as anxiety disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mood disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder are also highly comorbid with ASD.4 Most adults with ASD have at least 1 comorbid psychiatric condition.10 Other common comorbidities include seizures, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal problems, and immune dysfunction.4,11
Autism spectrum disorder is usually diagnosed during childhood, generally during the first 2 years of life.7 Social deficits typically are noticeable in the toddler years, and parents may recognize that their children miss developmental milestones. Early diagnosis is critical for the implementation of early interventions, including psychological and behavioral therapies.7 Earlier ASD diagnoses are associated with improved quality of life compared to those in whom the diagnosis is delayed.12
A person’s sex may play a role in the age of diagnosis. A study that compared the age at diagnosis of ASD in 208 people found that males were more likely to be diagnosed before they were age 18 years, and females were more likely to be diagnosed in adulthood.12
In the United States, early diagnosis of ASD may be improving. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2020, children born in 2016 were 1.6 times as likely as children born in 2012 to be identified as having ASD by age 4.9
Autism spectrum disorder is an increasingly common condition. The CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network published its most recent surveillance report in 2023; it focused on data from 2020.1,13 The ADDM Network found approximately 1 in 36 children in the United States was estimated to have ASD.1,13 This prevalence has increased steadily over the last 20+ years. The estimated prevalence of ASD was 1 in 150 children in 2000, and 1 in 44 in 2018.1,13
The World Health Organization estimates that worldwide, approximately 1 in 100 people have ASD.5 This is not likely to be accurate, however, because many low-income countries have limitations with consistent reporting methods. In developing countries, there also may be less overall awareness of ASD and access to consistent medical care.5
Autism spectrum disorder affects people of all racial and ethnic groups.13 In the ADDM Network report, the estimated prevalence of ASD in 2020 was highest among Hispanic (3.3%) and Asian/Pacific Islander (3.2%) children, were followed by Black (2.9%), American Indian (2.7%), and White (2.4%) children.1,14 Children of 2 or more races had the lowest incidence of ASD (2.3%).1,14 These data differ from previous estimates, in which the prevalence was highest among White children.9
In the ADDM Network report, the prevalence of ASD also varied by geographic location. Of 11 state sites included in the report (Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin), the overall prevalence was highest in California (4.5%), while the estimated prevalence was lowest in Maryland (2.3%).1,9
The prevalence of ASD varies greatly by sex. In the United States, boys are about 4 times more likely than girls to receive a diagnosis of ASD.1,9 However, 2020 was the first time the ADDM Network estimated that the prevalence in girls was greater than 1%.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/postpartum-depression-medication/,Medication Options for Patients With Postpartum Depression,"Our easy-to-read fact sheets provide clinicians with reliable information to share with patients and their caregivers.
Postpartum depression is defined as the onset of major depression associated with childbirth that negatively affects the mood and behavior of the parent.1 During pregnancy, an individual undergoes considerable hormonal fluctuations, including increased levels of estrogen and progesterone. After childbirth, these hormone levels drop rapidly, which can contribute to the onset of postpartum depression. Additionally, the postpartum period is often accompanied by increased stress due to the demands of caring for a newborn, sleep deprivation, and hormonal changes.
For new parents battling postpartum depression, finding the right medication to manage your condition can be a critical step towards healing and supporting your mental health. Our helpful guide aims to inform patients about the risks, benefits, and considerations associated with postpartum depression medication as they begin their recovery.
Depression is a general term for a common psychiatric disorder that presents with symptoms such as sadness, irritability, loss of interest in activities, feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, guilt or anxiety, concerns over death, and/or suicidal ideation. Individuals with depression may also experience fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and changes in their appetite weight, and sleep.2
Major depressive disorder, or MDD, is characterized by a sad mood and/or lack of interest in activities. A diagnosis of MDD requires the presence of at least 5 of the key symptoms for most of the day, nearly every day, or for at least 2 weeks.1,3
Postpartum depression is classified as a major depressive disorder that begins during or after childbirth, typically within the first 3 months and up to 1 year after childbirth. Approximately 15% to 20% of childbearing individuals develop postpartum depression each year. Although it is one of the most common complications of the postpartum period, it is often underdiagnosed and undertreated.1,4
Symptoms of postpartum depression may overlap with MDD, but include unstable mood, anxiety, irritability, extreme sadness, decreased pleasure, low energy, as well as obsessive worry – typically about the baby’s health, feeding, and safety. More serious symptoms that require immediate evaluation by a provider are thoughts about self-harm, suicide, or harming one’s child.1,3,4
While the exact cause of postpartum depression is not fully understood, several key factors contribute to its development:5,6
If you are experiencing symptoms of postpartum depression, speak with your provider to discuss treatment options. Currently, antidepressants in combination with psychotherapy are recommended to treat moderate-to-severe depression.1 Commonly used postpartum depression medication options include the following:
It’s important to recognize that postpartum depression is a complex and multifaceted condition that varies from person to person. Although the transition to parenthood can be challenging for many individuals, when symptoms persist and significantly impact daily functioning, it may indicate the presence of postpartum depression. Seeking professional help is crucial for diagnosis and treatment.
If you think you may have postpartum depression, it is important to speak with your provider. Your provider can provide a clinical assessment or utilize self-report tools, such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) – a widely and reliably used screening tool for postpartum depression.15 Physicians are encouraged to screen for postpartum depression at the first postnatal obstetrical visit. If you or a loved one are experiencing symptoms of postpartum depression, follow-up with your provider to discuss diagnostic and treatment options.
It is recommended that patients who are currently breastfeeding, or planning on breastfeeding, should first speak with their provider to discuss the potential risks and benefits of different medication options. The decision to use antidepressants during postpartum while breastfeeding involves careful consideration of both the potential risks and benefits for both the parent and the baby.
Treating postpartum depression with antidepressants can improve parental mental health and reduces the risk for paternal self-harm or harm to their child. However, some medications can pass into breast milk.10-13 There is ongoing research regarding the long-term effects of antidepressant exposure during breastfeeding on infant development. While some studies have suggested potential concerns, the overall consensus is that the benefits of breastfeeding typically outweigh the potential risks for antidepressant exposure.
For example, sertraline and paroxetine have a better safety profile for infants during breastfeeding, but there is less available data for other serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as escitalopram and duloxetine.1,8 When taking fluoxetine, it is recommended to monitor infants for agitation, irritability, poor feeding, and poor weight gain.16 Research also indicates that zuranolone has potential risk for harm to the infant. It is recommended to use effective contraception during zuranolone treatment and for 1 week after the final dose.14
In many cases, the benefits of treating postpartum depression with antidepressants outweigh the potential risks, but it’s important to carefully consider all factors and explore alternative treatments if appropriate.
It is important to consult your provider before discontinuing treatment. Discontinuation during pregnancy may increase your likelihood of a depression relapse, compared with individuals who continue antidepressants.11,12 However, if you experience new or worsening depression, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, mania, or suicidal thoughts and behavior, you should speak with your provider to determine if this is a side effect of your medication.
Newer postpartum depression medications such as Brexanolone and Zuranolone have specific durations of therapy. Zuranolone should only be taken once daily for 14 days while brexanolone is administered as a continuous infusion over 60 hours (2.5 days).13,14
You should stop taking your medication and seek immediate medical help if you experience a seizure or an allergic reaction such as development of skin rash, hives, chest pain, edema, and shortness of breath.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/biomedical-therapy-autism/,Biomedical Therapy for Autism,"Our easy-to-read fact sheets provide clinicians with reliable information to share with patients and their caregivers.
Biomedical therapy for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is becoming increasingly popular as a complementary treatment option to traditional medication regimes, yet many patients are still unclear about what biomedical therapy entails. Therefore, the following fact sheet provides a helpful overview of biomedical therapy for ASD and answers commonly asked questions.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with impairment in social communication and interactions as well as the presence of restricted, repetitive behaviors.1 It is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, though the direct cause is still unknown.2
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) is considered the gold standard for ASD diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria for ASD are graded on a severity scale by the level of support needed, in which Level 1 requires support, Level 2 requires substantial support, and Level 3 requires very substantial support.2
Because ASD occurs on a spectrum, treatment options can vary with each patient depending on their unique set of symptoms. There is no curative treatment for ASD, but the management of ASD takes on a multifaceted approach that includes occupational, behavioral, speech, and play therapies. Psychosocial interventions can also help improve specific behaviors, such as language and social engagement.3
Although there are no medications directly indicated for the treatment of ASD specifically, many individuals receive medication for comorbidities associated with their diagnosis. Patients with ASD may take medication for irritability, aggression, hyperactivity, and seizures that may co-present with the condition.2 Some examples of the common medications used to manage these other symptoms and disorders may include:4
Biomedical therapy is a specific treatment approach that considers the underlying biological basis of a condition and targets physiological impairment.5 The goal of biomedical therapy for autism is to optimize physiological factors impacting brain function and development to treat symptoms and improve patient functioning.
Research indicates that ASD is associated with deficits in mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress as well as abnormalities in the regulation of the following essential metabolites:6
Biomedical therapy can be categorized based on the pathophysiological process they target.
The mitochondria generate energy for cellular processes. When the mitochondria is impaired, it can lead to developmental delays, muscle weakness, and neurological problems.6 Individuals with ASD who have mitochondrial dysfunction often have more severe behavioral and cognitive deficits, relative to those with typical mitochondrial function. Treatments may include:6
Folate is naturally found in the human body and helps to regulate the absorption of vitamin B. However, individuals with ASD may have genetic modifications in the folate pathway which leads to a decrease in available folate in the brain, known as cerebral folate deficiency. Lack of folate causes symptoms such as fatigue and muscle weakness. Patients with folate irregularity are treated with folinic acid for neurological, behavioral, and cognitive improvements.6
Redox reactions are necessary for many biological functions. Evidence has shown that individuals with ASD may have abnormal redox metabolism which could lead to oxidative damage in areas of the brain responsible for speech, emotion, and social behavior. Several treatments for oxidative stress are available, including:6
These treatment options can help improve many common ASD symptoms, including hyperactivity, tantrums, sensory-motor skills, irritability, and even sleep and gastrointestinal symptoms.
Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is naturally found in the body and is necessary for multiple important metabolic pathways. Abnormalities in BH4 are prominent in ASD, as the disorder is associated with a lack of oxidative stress needed for BH4 pathways. Treatment for BH4 metabolic dysfunction is primarily the use of sapropterin, a synthetic form of BH4. Sapropretin has been shown to improve cognitive ability, communication, adaptability, verbal expression, and social function in patients with ASD.6
At what stage should I consider biomedical therapy for autism?
Because ASD is a lifelong condition that occurs on a spectrum, there is no standard timeline for when a treatment should be started.7 Interventions are tailored to the patient’s specific needs. Although supplements are generally safe and well tolerated, they can have interactions with certain medications. Speak with your healthcare provider when making decisions on treatment options as it is important to keep track of your medications to monitor improvement and prevent adverse medication interactions.
How long does it take to see improvement?
When evaluating treatment success, it is important to consider what symptoms or conditions are being targeted. For example, some patients may be seeking treatment to sleep better or decrease their repetitive behaviors. Tracking progress by logging symptoms and improvements can help you and your provider gain an accurate measure of your treatment response. Improvements may not be seen immediately, especially as certain medications can take time to show measurable effects. Your symptoms may fluctuate over time, so consistent medication adherence is necessary to improve your chances of overall improvement.8
Are there side effects associated with these treatments?
All of the biomedical treatments mentioned throughout this fact sheet are generally considered safe and well-tolerated. However, there are minor side effects for some of these treatments, as detailed below:
Not all patients respond to treatment options in the same way. Patients should speak with their providers to discuss their treatment plan and any potential side effects they may experience.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/your-patient-is-going-on-a-thru-hike/,Your Patient is Going on a Thru-Hike,"Thru-hiking is a long-term endeavor in which a hiker walks a long-distance trail with continuous footsteps from one end to another.1 There is limited data to provide evidence-based recommendations for assessing patient readiness for long-term hiking. Anecdotes from thru-hikers suggest that many health care providers respond with “Wow, great!” but do not provide in-depth evaluation or counseling. The lack of understanding of the hardships hikers encounter during and after-thru hike can leave hikers without adequate preparation medical treatment.
Halfwayanywhere.com is a site that collects voluntary data from thru-hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), one of the most popular thru-hikes in the US that runs 2650 miles. Due to the voluntary nature of the survey, the data on the site is not expected to be 100% accurate; however, it provides a useful overview of thru-hikers. Of 2022 hikers, 55.3% were male, with females and genderqueer, transgender females, and agender hikers representing the rest. Hikers of all ages hike the PCT; 37.17% were under 30 years; 21.58% were over 50 years; and 41.24% were between 30 and 50 years. Regarding their educational background, 80.4% had some post-secondary education, with 47.5% having a bachelor’s degree. For 43.1% of these hikers, this was their first thru-hike. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most fit, the respondents rated their average fitness level at 5.8 prior to the hike.2
The failure rate for thru-hikers of the PCT is about 50%.3 Some reasons for this high rate of non-completion include injury, weather (such as fires or snow), work, family, feeling defeated, and illness.4 Many people take on the endeavor of a thru-hike with a romantic notion of campfires and sleeping under the stars without seriously considering the hardships undergone throughout the journey (heat, cold, many miles, carrying a heavy pack, and wear and tear on the body). Sometimes the reality of the hike clashes with the pre-conceived notions of the hike, leading to depression and frustration on the trail. In addition, there has been documentation of post-trail depression5. The causes are unknown, but are thought to be related to lack of endorphins, lack of goals, returning to the reality of day-to-day life and responsibilities, and other cultural responsibilities once off trail.
These concerns raise the need for health care providers to assess and counsel patients presenting for a physical prior to a thru-hike. A full assessment is important, with careful consideration given to cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and neurologic examinations. This assessment should be focused on areas that may hinder the progress of the hiker, including medical diagnoses. In addition, a thorough mental status and goal assessment should be included as the re-adjustment to non-hiking life can be difficult for some.
Patient with diabetes, for example, will need to know how to adjust their insulin; that their glucose meter must be kept in their sleeping bag together with electronics and water filters to keep from freezing; what glucose limits are right for them; and how much glucose to take if they have a crash. Remind your patients with diabetes that having higher glucose levels is always better than hypoglycemia. This discussion may also result in modification of the amount of daily long-acting insulin used.


Female hikers have particular health concerns that we have addressed in an earlier article.
Proper nutrition is key in order for the hiker to complete their event.6 Regardless of the hiker’s dietary style, the primary nutritional considerations are total calories and quality of calories. Thru-hikers may spend several hours on the trail each day, potentially raising an individual’s energy expenditure 2- to 3-fold. This may be compounded by the weight of the hiker’s pack (average 20% of bodyweight), increasing the energy expenditure and workload further.7 One key to a successful hike is consuming enough calories to match the increased demands.
Consistently consuming fewer calories relative to the increased demands may lead to low energy availability (LEA), which can lead to serious consequences. For female hikers, this can mean menstrual dysfunction and reduction in bone mineral density; for male athletes, a reduction in ferritin and vitamin D concentrations.8 Appropriate total calories are essential for thru-hikers as intake directly impacts energy availability, recovery processes, and total body-mass fluctuations throughout the journey. The use of technology on the trail to help monitor calorie expenditure and consumption is available; however, these tools can sometimes incorrectly estimate caloric needs. Finally, consider referring the hiker to a nutrition professional who specializes in sports, ultra-endurance exercise, or similar fields to help the hiker prepare appropriately.
Weight loss will likely occur, but the hiker should be alerted to signs and symptoms of when this weight loss may interfere with health, performance, and recovery. Each hiker has a different body composition, so the actual amount of weight loss will be variable. Attention should be paid to decreasing performance, loss of energy, or change in mood as these could be indicators of excessive weight or muscle loss. Identifying weight loss may be a challenge since scales are not always available. Other objective and subjective weight management tools, such as the fit of clothing and visual inspection in mirrors, can be used to help the hiker track weight fluctuations.
Hikers should be encouraged to explore calorically dense food options that emphasize essential nutrients such as oils, nuts, seeds, dairy, etc; and complete protein food sources such as tuna, salmon or chicken packets, beef jerky, dairy, and protein bars. Once total calories are considered, portions and meal timing can be individualized. Meals are recommended on a more frequent schedule. All meals and snacks should emphasize total calories and nutrient density. Particular attention should be paid to total dietary fat and dietary protein as these are required for recovery and structural integrity. When considering protein, find ways to encourage the hiker to consume complete proteins (animal protein sources) or complementary protein sources (a mix of plant proteins plus a branched-chain amino acid supplement) to help support recovery needs, reduce exercise-induced inflammation, and manage oxidative stress.
Proper hydration is paramount to performance and recovery. Currently, hydration guidelines are personalized using the weight, urine, thirst (WUT) model by Sekiguchi et al.9 The WUT model takes into consideration total body weight, urine color, and an individual’s thirst level as indicators for hydration.
While exact intake needs are individualized, a starting point could be 1 liter for every 5 miles hiked. The hiker should be instructed to personalize from there. Another method of assessing hydration on the go is the use of the urine color chart (Figure 1).10
Temperature and elevation also have an impact on the need for hydration and should be included in the planning. Alert your patients to the need to monitor their urine for odor, color, and amount. Urine should not have any odor. An odor in urine could be a sign of urinary tract infection (UTI).  The goal is for urine to be light yellow with a good flow. Any deviation from this may indicate poor hydration and should be addressed with increased fluids and possibly electrolytes.
Electrolyte imbalances are a concern due to the extended daily exercise, environmental conditions, and decreased intake of foods with high water content. While electrolytes are encouraged, personal consultation should be provided for each individual to ensure electrolyte intake does not interfere with any health or medical conditions.
There are a variety of sources on the market that can aid in electrolyte replenishment. Sodium is the primary electrolyte lost in sweat, so ensuring thru-hikers replenish sodium each day is vital. Magnesium is directly involved in skeletal muscle recovery so hikers may consider increasing magnesium intake. Some products are readily available to assist with electrolyte supplementation. Electrolyte supplementation should provide sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium. Examples of these products are Nuun Sport Tablets, Drip Drops, Liquid IV, and some MIO products.
As health care providers we can provide hikers with a list of medications that will be helpful in dealing with some of the frequent issues they might encounter on the trail. Careful instructions and explanations on how to take these medications are needed. If a hiker uses hearing aids or glasses, they should plan for what to do if they are lost or broken.
Ibuprofen is perhaps the best medication for aches and pains. Contraindications for these should be explored with the patient and considerations on taking the medication should be discussed.
Antidiarrhea medications are helpful (ie, loperamide). Discussion about when and how to take them is recommended, including when to start and for how long. Two common causes of diarrhea on the trail, Giardia and Salmonella, can be disastrous without treatment. Hydration is also a concern if the hiker develops diarrhea. Regular use of stool softeners may help to maintain the stool consistency. Bismuth tablets are easy to carry and may be helpful with gastrointestinal complaints.
Allergic reactions to seasonal allergens, or to bug bites, including mosquitoes, bees, ants, or spiders, benefit from small dosages of oral and/or topical diphenhydramine. Alert the hiker to potential side effects.
In case of exposure to poison ivy, poison oak, or sumac, alert patients that it could take hours or even days for the rash to appear. Zanfel is a topical cream known to minimize the symptoms associated with exposure to these plants. Some patients might require steroids, depending on the severity of the reaction.
The antibiotic cephalexin can be used for UTIs, sinus infections, skin infections, and diarrhea. Ciprofloxacin can also be prescribed for these conditions; however, the risk of photosensitivity and tendon rupture/tendonitis makes this the second choice. Azithromycin is another drug used for traveler’s diarrhea and can be prescribed with instructions on how and when to take. Bactrim DS can also be prescribed for the development of traveler’s diarrhea, UTI, sinus infection, or skin infections.
Knowing which infections are endemic to the area is important. Trails like the Appalachian Trail are known for tickborne diseases such as Lyme disease, in which case a prescription for doxycycline might be appropriate to have on hand. When prescribing antibiotics, discuss allergies and seek antibiotics that can be used for multiple conditions.
Corticosteroids such as prednisone can be prescribed as a short-term course for skin eruptions due to poison ivy or poison oak exposure in sensitive individuals. Hikers with asthma should have a dose of corticosteroids along with them.
For routine medications, hikers should carry enough of a supply with them to last for the entire hike. This includes inhalers for asthma, hypertension medications, oral and injectable hypoglycemics for patients with diabetes, non-sedating antihistamines for environmental allergies, thyroid medications, and other medications that the hiker usually takes. There should be a discussion about nonessential medications or those that can be skipped during the hike. Special attention should be given to drugs such as blood thinners, antidepressants, seizure medications, and migraine medications. Drugs that require regular blood levels to be drawn need to be discussed, and plans made for this intervention while on the trail.
All hikers should be current with their tetanus immunization (Td or Tdap), flu shots, and COVID-19 vaccinations. A series of hepatitis A vaccines (2 doses for lifetime protection) is strongly encouraged due to the risk of acquiring this condition when on the trail.
Hikers should consider the use of an emergency satellite device. Some devices, such as InReach and Spot, allow the hiker to notify someone on the daily start and end of the hike. Family and friends at home can follow their progress. If there is an emergency, these devices can send an SOS. Some of these devices communicate via satellite, allowing for text communication.  If the hikers is using a mapping or trail app, they should make sure they know how to use it before they start.
Encourage the hiker to take as light a pack as possible and to clearly determine what needs to go with them and what they consider luxury items that perhaps can stay behind. The hiker should consider why they want to do this endeavor and what are their goals for this, and what will happen if they don’t complete their entire proposed journey.

For preparation and health concerns specific to female hikers, see this related article:Female Hikers’ Health Concerns During Long-Distance Hikes","Lillia Loriz, PhD, APRN, GNP-BC; Julie Baker-Townsend, DNP, APRN, FNP-BC; Patricia Richards, MSN, MEd, DNP, APRN, FNP-BC; Catherine Saenz, PhD, RD, CSCS"
https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/antidepressants-for-ibs/,Antidepressants for IBS: What Gastroenterologists Need to Know,"A recent national health survey showed that the estimated prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) ranges between 4.7% and 5.3%, with the prevalence being higher than that of previous estimates.1
Considered a disorder of the gut-brain interaction (previously referred to as a functional gastrointestinal disorder) characterized by abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habits, IBS has further been classified based on predominant stool form in more than 25% of bowel movements. The categories include: IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), and IBS with mixed bowel habits. With this, IBS often requires multidisciplinary management.1,2
The 2021 American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guideline update for IBS management3 states that tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) — also referred to as neuromodulators — may be used to manage global IBS symptoms. Clinicians can recommend gut-directed psychotherapies to patients with IBS after weighing their safety and efficacy, as well as the type of IBS. Research has shown that patients with IBS-D may have a better response to TCAs because of their anticholinergic properties that are known to improve diarrhea; however, all patients with IBS being considered for TCA therapy must be started on a low dose with a gradual dose titration upward. The role of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in IBS has also been discussed in some studies.3,4
A 2023 study (ATLANTIS; ISRCTN48075063) published in The Lancet specifically discussed the use of low-dose amitriptyline (10-30 mg) as a second-line treatment for IBS.5
“Amitriptyline was significantly more effective than placebo for people with IBS in primary care who had experienced no benefit from first-line treatments (changes in diet, fiber, laxatives, antidiarrheal agents, or antispasmodic agents),” noted Professor Alexander Ford, the lead author of the ATLANTIS study, professor of gastroenterology, and honorary consultant gastroenterologist at Leeds Institute of Medical Research at St James, University of Leeds and Leeds Gastroenterology Institute, and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, UK. “The effect was seen across all subtypes of IBS and was not accompanied by a change in mood scores, meaning that amitriptyline is not acting as an antidepressant in IBS but is having its effects on gut motility and pain sensation.”
Dr Ford concluded that, “[General practitioners] should offer amitriptyline to patients with IBS who have not experienced a benefit with first-line treatments.”
We received expert insights on the use of antidepressants for IBS treatment and what providers should know before prescribing these medications for patients in gastroenterology.
The gastroenterology perspective below was provided by Douglas A. Drossman, MD, professor emeritus of medicine and psychiatry at the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at University of North Carolina (UNC); founder and co-director at UNC Center for Functional GI and Motility Disorders; and founder, president emeritus, and CEO of the Rome Foundation.
One of the first things that comes up for me from a gastrointestinal perspective is the stigma attached to patients being prescribed antidepressants, which is why [the Rome Foundation] reframed these medications and called them “neuromodulators”6 that act on the brain-gut axis and not necessarily on the psychiatric profile. It’s important for providers to explain these medications as “altered physiology”; there is a dysregulation of the brain-gut control mechanism leading to symptoms of pain, nausea, and vomiting, and these neuromodulators reverse that.
There are different classes of these neuromodulators or antidepressants for gastroenterology. For example, SSRIs can enhance motility and alleviate constipation, a side effect being diarrhea, but a TCA would also treat the pain and slow down the bowel and treat diarrhea.4
We did a survey of 600 gastroenterologists and most of them were familiar with TCAs, but were much less familiar with SSRIs or SNRIs. Most of their [dilemma] about treatment was they didn’t know what and how to use these medications, and that’s very important to address.
When patients with IBS receive a single medication and are not getting better, you can combine medications. This is where psychiatrist consults can be of help, for modifying the dosage or adding a second medication called augmentation.
The psychiatry perspective below was provided by W. Scott Griffies, MD, associate consulting professor, Duke Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.
A significant percentage of the patients in the ATLANTIS trial5 had anxiety and depression, in addition to IBS, which do not respond to low-dose amitriptyline.  So, the comorbidities are something that need to be thought about, and additional treatment may be needed in some cases and referrals to psychiatrists and psychologists would be very helpful and appropriate.
Along those lines, a lot of these are central sensitizing disorders so they overlap with a number of other central sensitizing disorders, such as fibromyalgia and migraines, which also need to be addressed. Many patients with gut-brain interactions have trauma that would qualify for psychiatric treatment.
A review6 by researchers at the University of Leeds, UK, regarding the management of IBS showed that central neuromodulators, including TCAs and SSRIs, resulted in a higher incidence of total adverse events. However, the use of central neuromodulators can be considered when first-line treatments are inadequate. Authors of the review also noted that TCAs may be preferred to SSRIs at low doses (for example, 10 mg at night due to risk for drowsiness), with dose titration up to 50 mg, depending on patient response. Doses greater than 50 mg may be associated with higher rates of adverse events.6
Discussing the overall safety of antidepressant medications, Dr Drossman noted, “The problem with looking at these medications for IBS is they haven’t been well-studied. The only ones that have been well-studied are the TCAs, of which we may use one-thirds [sic] to one-fifth of the dose used in psychiatry and are actually quite safe. However, there are side effects like dry mouth, blurry vision, and constipation. But overall, the side effects are nothing to be too concerned about. The SSRIs for anxiety may cause diarrhea and night sweats; with duloxetine, the side effect is nausea and rarely constipation. But when doses are low, they are generally quite safe.”7
Assessing safety data from the ATLANTIS trial,5 the majority of participants reported at least 1 mild to severe side effect at 3 and 6 months of amitriptyline use for IBS (97% and 99%, respectively), followed by at least 1 moderate to severe side effect in the same time periods (81% and 77%, respectively). The most common side effects reported at any frequency included drowsiness, dry mouth, and diarrhea.5
If treatment response is suboptimal, augmentation with a second agent may be considered after the dose has been increased. For example, adding an antipsychotic medication, such as quetiapine, to existing IBS treatment may improve anxiety and sleep disturbances.7 Dr Griffies also spoke about the importance of augmentation in psychiatry and why it may be useful in gastroenterology, though it may be more challenging for some patients with IBS than others.
Timely, appropriate, and evidence-based management of IBS symptoms is important to improve outcomes and patient satisfaction.6
“The first thing I would do [when considering antidepressant treatment for IBS] is get information from the patient, such as their history of medications. It’s much easier to respond to preconceptions rather than give them a litany of information and not know whether they have prior biases,” Dr Drossman indicated. Of note, a paper by Dr Drossman and colleagues refers to establishing a “therapeutic relationship” when prescribing neuromodulator treatment to patients with gut-brain interaction disorders.7
Communication goals should be aimed at improving patient acceptance and adherence.“ For example, some patients may express that ‘these medications may alter [their] mind,’ to which providers can say that ‘[these medications] are not intended to alter the mind; they are used in psychiatry in higher doses to treat conditions like anxiety and depression,” Dr Drossman said. “But we’re using it in lower doses to normalize pain sensitivity and raise sensation threshold through neurotransmitters working on the gut-brain axis. Patients need to know that medications can have multiple purposes — neuromodulators can treat anxiety but also reduce the pain of IBS.”
“Overall, educating patients should be an iterative process,” he concluded. “In addition, gastroenterologists need to become familiar with these medications because they have been shown to be effective.
Collaboration between gastroenterology and psychiatry providers to provide appropriate treatment for this population may be valuable.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/failure-prescribe-pain-medications-suicide/,Should Clinicians Be Liable for Patient Suicide After Failing to Prescribe Pain Medications?,"Mr M was a 48-year-old married man with 3 children. He had been seeing his primary care physician (PCP) regularly since 2005 for chronic, debilitating cervical pain. The patient had been diagnosed with multi-level degenerative disc disease and cervical radiculopathy stemming from injuries he sustained in a car accident in his 20’s. The patient was prescribed opioid medications for pain management by his previous PCP, starting in 2005.
Mr M took his medication as prescribed and showed up for his medical appointments. By 2017, the patient was on a combination of medications to manage his pain including morphine sulfate (60 mg 3 times a day), oxycodone/paracetamol (5/324 mg every 4 hours, as needed), and zolpidem (10 mg/d),
In late February 2017, Mr M was told that his PCP was retiring in a few weeks and he should find a new primary care provider. He set up an appointment to establish care at another clinic but his first appointment was not until May. In early April, Mr M filled his final prescription from his PCP. By early May, the patient had run out of medication but was unable to get an earlier PCP appointment.
In severe intractable pain, Mr M went to his local emergency department (ED) in mid-May, the day before his new PCP appointment. He told the ED providers that his morphine sulfate prescription had lapsed the previous day. He explained that his physician had retired and he was unable to get an appointment with a new primary care provider until the next day.
Mr M was given 1 dose of morphine sulfate in the ED and was then sent home with instructions to follow up with his primary care provider. The next morning, he went to his appointment at the new clinic. There he was assigned to a physician associate (PA). The PA examined the patient but did not refill Mr M’s opioid prescriptions. Because the PA did not take thorough notes, there was no mention in the patient’s record of why he refused to refill the prescriptions, or whether he consulted with any of the 4 supervising physicians at the practice.
What is known is that the PA did not renew the existing prescriptions and sent the patient home without pain medication. Mr M experienced severe withdrawal from the morphine, and, feeling hopeless, died by suicide the following day. He was survived by a wife and 3 children.
The patient’s widow hired an attorney who sued the PA and all 4 of the supervising physicians at the clinic. Discovery began, and the plaintiff’s attorney retained an expert physician to go over Mr M’s medical records.
The expert physician concluded that there was evidence of medical negligence in the treatment of Mr M. Specifically, the expert noted that the care provided by the PA and his supervisors fell below the appropriate standard of care required in such a case. The expert’s report alleged that the PA and his supervisors had:
The expert’s list of the clinicians’ failures was extensive and blamed the supervising physicians as well for failing the patient.
The case was settled out of court for an unpublished amount. It is unclear why the family did not sue the original PCP who retired and left his long-time patient without any direction.
We cannot tell from the facts in this case why the PA declined to renew Mr M’s prescriptions. The doses of opioids may have been higher than the PA was used to seeing in a primary care practice.
There were many mistakes in this case. The retiring PCP left his patient without clear instructions or referral to a pain specialist. He should have helped Mr M find a new provider who would continue the opioids, or he should have helped the patient to taper off his medications before he left his practice. Instead, the PCP retired and left his patient with no continuity of care.
It is not clear whether the PA had access to Mr M’s previous medical records at the time of their meeting. However, not treating a patient who is opioid-dependent is negligent. Mr M was not offered anything to help with his pain or offered medical management of his opioid withdrawal, a short prescription for pain relief, or a referral to a pain specialist. He was sent home in physical pain with no recourse.
We are all aware of the opioid “epidemic” in this country and the hazards that these medications can bring, but that should never be an excuse to deprive a patient of desperately needed help.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/autism-symptoms-in-women/,Autism Symptoms in Women: Camouflaged or Overlooked?,"As physicians and researchers continue to refine their understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), increasing evidence is shedding light on the distinct manifestation of autism symptoms in women.1 Because of the historical emphasis on the stereotypical presentation of ASD among boys and men, women with ASD have often been overlooked or misdiagnosed due to the unique behavioral patterns and challenges faced by women with ASD.
This has contributed to the development of a sex and gender bias in which neurodevelopmental conditions are diagnosed at a significantly higher rate for boys/men compared to girls/women. In particular, ASD has a 1% prevalence in children with a 3:1 boy-to-girl ratio.1
Correspondingly, women with ASD may not receive an official diagnosis until later in adulthood. Failure to recognize ASD in girls/women at an early age may lead to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis with other mental health conditions, greatly impacting their mental health, social functioning, and quality of life — compounded by an increased risk of developing comorbid eating disorders, sleep disorders, neurological conditions, and/or psychiatric conditions.2,3
Given the adverse outcomes associated with the under-recognition of ASD symptoms, understanding the presentation of autism symptoms in women can help equip physicians with the knowledge needed to better identify and support women with ASD to improve their quality of life.
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the diagnostic criteria for ASD must include persistent deficits observed in each of the following 3 domains of social communication and interaction:4
In addition to these social and communication deficits, individuals must have a history or current presentation of at least 2 of the 4 types of restricted, repetitive behaviors:4
These 7 diagnostic criteria for ASD are graded on a severity scale by the level of support needed, in which Level 1 requires support, Level 2 requires substantial support, and Level 3 requires very substantial support.4
Although the DSM-5 has standardized the diagnostic criteria for ASD, women often elude official diagnosis at an earlier age because their initial symptoms manifest differently, relative to men.
Psychiatry Advisor spoke with Tatiana Rivera Cruz, LICSW, a licensed clinical social worker and therapist, who shared her expertise and insights about these sex- and gender-related differences among individuals with ASD.
She stated, “Boys often [are] diagnosed early on, around 2.5 to 3 years [of age], because the symptoms of autism [are] extremely noticeable and very intense — in particular, extreme, repetitive, behavioral patterns (like hand shaking or repeating certain words) or absence of sensory skills or specific sensory preferences.”
Conversely, she explained that “With girls, the symptoms of autism are muted and not as noticeable. Often times, the symptoms of autism that manifest in women are confused with ADHD, depression, anxiety, or social anxiety.” These misdiagnoses can have a major effect on individuals, as Ms Cruz highlights when discussing her encounter with a patient.
I treated a [woman] who was diagnosed with autism much later in life. The [woman] mentioned that she couldn’t understand what was happening to her because she felt that she couldn’t be social with people or communicate well. She didn’t understand social cues. She didn’t get sarcasm. She didn’t get jokes. She believed it was social anxiety because being around people understandably gave her anxiety since she couldn’t understand them and felt like she didn’t fit in.
When we evaluated her, she met all the criteria for an autism diagnosis — yet for years she received psychotherapy treatments for depression, anxiety, and social anxiety. These treatments weren’t really addressing the underlying problem, rather they were just managing secondary symptoms that developed due to autism.
Aligned with Ms Cruz’s observations, research indicates that boys with ASD exhibit more pronounced restricted, repetitive behaviors compared with girls, promoting earlier recognition and diagnosis by clinicians.1,5 Girls, on the other hand, demonstrate greater social communication skills, prelinguistic and linguistic functioning, autobiographical memory, and cognitive flexibility than boys with ASD.1
Studies also indicate that women with ASD are more likely to be diagnosed with comorbid cardiovascular, endocrine, gastrointestinal, nutrition, and psychiatric disorders, relative to men with ASD.3
Researchers have theorized that differences in sex hormones during the prenatal period affect brain anatomy, function, and gene expression. These sex-based differences in brain development may in turn contribute to the different manifestations that are observed in ASD, like the ability of women with ASD to more frequently and successfully mask or camouflage their symptoms of ASD due to their heightened skills of observation, analysis, imitation, and communication.1
In addition to the differences in symptom presentation and comorbid conditions observed between girls/women and boys/men, delayed diagnosis of ASD in women may be due to societal factors, including clinician bias, parental education, and compensatory behaviors exhibited by girls/women with ASD.
According to qualitative research studies, women diagnosed with ASD in adulthood reported that healthcare providers often dismissed their symptoms and lacked awareness of the differences in ASD symptom manifestation among women, leading to delayed diagnoses.6
A systematic review published in 2021 confirmed these self-reported concerns, as investigators found that clinician bias was a barrier to early ASD diagnosis among women. Parents of girls with ASD perceived a hesitancy or reluctance among clinicians to diagnose girls with ASD, and girls were often misdiagnosed with other conditions. The authors noted that part of this reluctance may correspond to the perceived higher incidence of ASD among boys.5
Because ASD has long been associated with the stereotypical presentation displayed by boys, many parents believed that ASD was not a relevant diagnosis for girls — thereby dissuading parents from identifying symptoms and seeking a diagnosis earlier in their child’s life. Overall, parents of boys are around 1.46 times more likely to express 1 or more concerns about ASD than parents of girls.5
Ms Cruz commented, “Misinformation is another thing, especially in social media. This may be a cause for delayed diagnosis because people might get the sense that seeking out a diagnosis or an explanation for why they are different from other people isn’t necessary.” Potential misinformation regarding the importance of an early ASD diagnosis and prompt treatment may thwart parents, or even patients themselves, from taking action to seek a diagnosis of ASD.
Given that girls with ASD more frequently use camouflaging techniques to mask social difficulties when interacting with peers, their symptoms may not be as apparent to parents and physicians.5
In a review of the diagnostic implications of autism symptoms in women, study authors broke down social camouflaging into 3 categories: 1) compensation for autistic traits or behaviors, 2) masking one’s own autistic traits via constant monitoring of personal behaviors (such as eye contact, gestures, facial expressions), and 3) assimilating other people’s behaviors and forcing oneself to perform and pretend during social interactions
To further elaborate, Ms Cruz gave the following examples of camouflaging or masking techniques effectively used by girls and women with ASD:
Another aspect that may mask ASD in women is the concept that their “special interests” or intense focuses on particular subjects may align more with their neurotypical peers, such as interests in celebrities or animals, like horses. However, the intensity of interest remains atypical.8
Although these camouflaging behaviors may help women with ASD to fit in socially and interact with their neurotypical peers better, these behaviors are superficial coping methods that can promote autistic burnout, constant feelings of exhaustion, a loss of sense of self, and increased anxiety and stress.8
Studies indicate that women with ASD are objectively more adept at these camouflaging techniques than their male counterparts, and this heightened ability among women to mask their symptoms of ASD is associated with superior signal-detection sensitivity.10 Further, the gender-based expectations of girls/women to “be more social” or “act like a girl/woman” may promote a higher degree of censuring ASD symptoms while simultaneously adopting gender-normative social behaviors.9
A delayed diagnosis of ASD likely results in long-term consequences, given that early interventions during critical developmental stages in childhood can make a major difference in symptom trajectory. Ms Cruz extrapolated on these consequences, stating, “Not catching autism early can lead to increased difficulties with speech and language issues, executive function, self-regulation, and sensory sensitivities if these symptoms of autism are not treated early.”
Women with ASD are more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications, such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and mood stabilizers, while men with ASD have higher odds of being prescribed anticonvulsants, stimulants, or other medications typically used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (AHDH) to help manage their symptoms impulsivity, hyperactivity, and distractibility.10
These gender disparities in prescription trends parallel women’s experiences in medicine more generally, and are in line with Ms Cruz’s observation that women often are diagnosed with secondary mental health conditions, such as anxiety or depression, instead of their underlying disorder. These prescription differences reinforce the notion that ASD does in fact manifest differently in women and men.10
Undiagnosed ASD in women may also promote autistic burnout. Although symptoms of autistic burnout differ from case by case, it has been described as “an overwhelming sense of physical exhaustion.”11
Some individuals with autistic burnout may experience uncontrollable emotional outbursts of sadness or anger, intense anxiety, or even suicidal ideation. Autistic burnout can also exacerbate certain symptoms of ASD, including repetitive behaviors, heightened sensitivity to sensory input, or increased difficulty accepting changes to daily routines.11
Evidence suggests that autistic burnout often results as a consequence of camouflaging and mimicking neurotypical behavior, such as small talk, eye contact, and suppressing repetitive behaviors — all of which require significant effort and energy on the part of the individual with ASD.11
Ms Cruz recounted,
Most of the patients that I have seen with autism have said that they have coped with autism for a long time until a point where they can’t do it anymore. That feeling was the driving force behind them eventually seeking help and an official diagnosis. They coped for so many years trying to overcome situations, avoid other situations, manage symptoms, or change the way they saw or did things. At the end, they just can’t do it anymore.
Diagnosing ASD in adult women may prove challenging to clinicians for several reasons. For example, developmental trajectories and outcomes of social communication vary more during adolescence and adulthood than childhood.12
Additionally, ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that by definition manifests in early childhood. If this diagnosis is missed during childhood, it may prove more challenging to diagnose in adults because their parents or other family members may no longer be present to provide reliable childhood medical history or symptom reporting. This is particularly important as patients may not be able to accurately recall or identify autistic traits they may have exhibited at a young age. 12
Given that women with ASD have an increased likelihood to develop comorbid conditions relative to men, clinicians may inadvertently focus more on the management of these conditions and thereby overlook the more subtle symptoms of ASD that are present in women.12
With this in mind, physicians should consider careful ASD screening assessments that account for autism symptoms in women, instead of relying on the more pronounced manifestations that are commonly associated with boys/men. Additionally, women who present with symptoms of ADHD, depression, anxiety, or social anxiety may warrant a full ASD assessment to ensure diagnostic accuracy.
Active efforts are needed to remedy this health disparity. Identifying this “lost generation”12 of adult women with ASD is the first step in validating the struggles that they are enduring, but just might be better at hiding.

This is the current health of children in America.
The National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (NAPNAP) held their annual meeting in March, in Denver, Colorado. NAPNAP is the largest gathering of pediatric NPs in the nation. One theme of the poster presentations was mental health, including screening children for suicide risk at regular check-ups. “Pediatric mental and behavioral health is very much a focus of NAPNAP and very much a concern of clinicians,” Regena Spratling, PhD, RN, APRN, CPNP-PC, FAANP, FAAN, president of NAPNAP and professor at Georgia State University, in Atlanta, told Clinical Advisor.
“The rise in adolescent suicide in the United States is certainly alarming and PNPs can be instrumental in ensuring that all adolescents in their population are appropriately screened,” said Mary Koslap-Petraco, DNP, PPCNP-BC, CPNP, FAANP, who covered the posters presentations for Clinical Advisor.
In addition to screening children, NAPNAP is also focused on mothers, including screening new mothers for postpartum depression at well-baby visits. “Even though we are pediatric providers, we know that the physical and mental health of the mother is important for the health of their infants and children,” Dr Spratling said. “Postpartum depression is an under-assessed issue and the lack of assessment and treatment can have far-reaching consequences, which could ultimately be fatal,” Mary Koslap-Petraco, DNP, PPCNP-BC, CPNP, FAANP, said. “Increasing screening of moms during a well-baby visit can increase the number of women who receive screening in a convenient place, thereby improving their access to mental health care.”
According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of the population reporting receipt of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines remains low for children and adults. Only 22.6% of children received the updated 2023-24 COVID-19 vaccine compared with 42.1% of adults age 65 and older; 51.8% of children received the flu vaccine.
Childhood illnesses once thought to be eliminated are making a comeback. An outbreak of measles had resulted in at least 64 recorded cases nationwide by mid-March, more than the total of 58 cases reported for all of last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
These statistics paint a bleak picture. The good news is that there are more than 8000 PNPs who are dedicating their lives to the care of children. Clinical Advisor is proud to share their research in our Conference Coverage section. We salute you all!

After he was weighed, he headed for an exam room decorated with decals of planets and cartoon characters. A nurse checked his blood pressure. A pediatrician asked about school, home life, and his friendships.
This seemed like a routine teen checkup, the kind that happens in thousands of pediatric practices across the US every day — until the doctor popped his next question.
“Any cravings for opioids at all?” asked pediatrician Safdar Medina, MD. The patient shook his head.
“None, not at all?” Dr Medina said again, to confirm.
“None,” said the boy named Sam, in a quiet but confident voice.
Only Sam’s first name is being used for this article because if his full name were publicized he could face discrimination in housing and job searches based on his prior drug use.
Medina was treating Sam for an addiction to opioids. He prescribed a medication called buprenorphine, which curbs cravings for the more dangerous and addictive opioid pills. Sam’s urine tests showed no signs of the Percocet or OxyContin pills he had been buying on Snapchat, the pills that fueled Sam’s addiction.
“What makes me really proud of you, Sam, is how committed you are to getting better,” said Dr Medina, whose practice is part of UMass Memorial Health.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends offering buprenorphine to teens addicted to opioids. But only 6% of pediatricians report ever doing so, according to survey results.
In fact, buprenorphine prescriptions for adolescents were declining as overdose deaths for 10- to 19-year-olds more than doubled. These overdoses, combined with accidental opioid poisonings among young children, have become the third-leading cause of death for US children.
“We’re really far from where we need to be and we’re far on a couple of different fronts,” said Scott Hadland, MD, the chief of adolescent medicine at Mass General for Children and a co-author of the study that surveyed pediatricians about addiction treatment.
That survey showed that many pediatricians don’t think they have the right training or personnel for this type of care — although Dr Medina and other pediatricians who do manage patients with addiction say they haven’t had to hire any additional staff.
Some pediatricians responded to the survey by saying they don’t have enough patients to justify learning about this type of care, or don’t think it’s a pediatrician’s job.
“A lot of that has to do with training,” said Deepa Camenga, MD, MHS, FAAP, associate director for pediatric programs for the Yale Program in Addiction Medicine. “It’s seen as something that’s a very specialized area of medicine and, therefore, people are not exposed to it during routine medical training.”
Dr Camenga and Dr Hadland said medical schools and pediatric residency programs are working to add information to their curricula about substance use disorders, including how to discuss drug and alcohol use with children and teens.
But the curricula aren’t changing fast enough to help the number of young people struggling with an addiction, not to mention those who die after taking just one pill.
In a twisted, deadly development, drug use among adolescents has declined — but drug-associated deaths are up.
The main culprits are fake Xanax, Adderall, or Percocet pills laced with the powerful opioid fentanyl. Nearly 25% of recent overdose deaths among 10- to 19-year-olds were traced to counterfeit pills.
“Fentanyl and counterfeit pills is really complicating our efforts to stop these overdoses,” said Andrew Terranella, MD, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s expert on adolescent addiction medicine and overdose prevention. “Many times these kids are overdosing without any awareness of what they’re taking.”
Dr Terranella said pediatricians can help by stepping up screening for — and having conversations about — all types of drug use.
He also suggests pediatricians prescribe more naloxone, the nasal spray that can reverse an overdose. It’s available over the counter, but Dr Terranella, who practices in Tucson, Arizona, believes a prescription may carry more weight with patients.
Back in the exam room, Sam was about to get his first shot of Sublocade, an injection form of buprenorphine that lasts 30 days. Sam is switching to the shots because he didn’t like the taste of Suboxone, oral strips of buprenorphine that he was supposed to dissolve under his tongue. He was spitting them out before he got a full dose.
Many doctors also prefer to prescribe the shots because patients don’t have to remember to take them every day. But the injection is painful. Sam was surprised when he learned that it would be injected into his belly over the course of 20 to 30 seconds.
“Is it almost done?” Sam asked, while a nurse coached him to breathe deeply. When it was over, staffers joked out loud that even adults usually swear when they get the shot. Sam said he didn’t know that was allowed. He’s mostly worried about any residual soreness that might interfere with his evening plans.
“Do you think I can snowboard tonight?” Sam asked the doctor.
“I totally think you can snowboard tonight,” Dr Medina answered reassuringly.
Sam was going with a new buddy. Making new friends and cutting ties with his former social circle of teens who use drugs has been one of the hardest things, Sam said, since he entered rehab 15 months ago.
“Surrounding yourself with the right people is definitely a big thing you want to focus on,” Sam said. “That would be my biggest piece of advice.”
For Sam, finding addiction treatment in a medical office jammed with puzzles, toys, and picture books has not been as odd as he thought it would be.
His mom, Julie, had accompanied him to this appointment. She said she’s grateful the family found a doctor who understands teens and substance use.
Before he started visiting the Tri-River Family Health Center, Sam had 7 months of residential and outpatient treatment — without ever being offered buprenorphine to help control cravings and prevent relapse. Only 1 in 4 residential programs for youth offer it. When Sam’s cravings for opioids returned, a counselor suggested Julie call Dr Medina.
“Oh my gosh, I would have been having Sam here, like, 2 or 3 years ago,” Julie said. “Would it have changed the path? I don’t know, but it would have been a more appropriate level of care for him.”
Some parents and pediatricians worry about starting a teenager on buprenorphine, which can produce side effects including long-term dependence. Pediatricians who prescribe the medication weigh the possible side effects against the threat of a fentanyl overdose.
“In this era, where young people are dying at truly unprecedented rates of opioid overdose, it’s really critical that we save lives,” said Dr Hadland. “And we know that buprenorphine is a medication that saves lives.”
Addiction care can take a lot of time for a pediatrician. Sam and Dr Medina text several times a week. Medina stresses that any exchange that Sam asks to be kept confidential is not shared.
Dr Medina said treating substance use disorder is one of the most rewarding things he does.
“If we can take care of it,” he said, “We have produced an adult that will no longer have a lifetime of these challenges to worry about.”
