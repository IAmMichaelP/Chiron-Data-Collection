          I'm a 70-year-old man with a family history of coronary artery disease. I currently take a low-dose statin. My recent LDL number is 105. Should I aim for a lower number?
        
        A. My situation is similar to yours. I have some family members who died young secondary to coronary heart disease, and I run a high total and ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. I exercise regularly and try to follow a Mediterranean-style diet.
        About 15 years ago, my doctor recommended starting a statin. Even at a low dose, I experienced more aches and pains than I had previously. I stopped the statin, but in retrospect, I now doubt that the muscle aches were related to the drug.
        Eight years ago, I had a chest CT scan unrelated to any heart issues. My lungs were fine, but the scan showed calcium deposits in my arteries, including the coronary arteries that feed oxygen and nutrients to the heart. That was a game changer. Calcium gets deposited into fatty plaques that accumulate in the arteries. I knew this indicated that my risks of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke were significantly elevated. I immediately began taking the maximum dose of rosuvastatin (Crestor). Interestingly, I had no muscle aches, even with the high dose.
        In general, the lower your LDL cholesterol number, the lower your risk of developing heart disease. My high risk and need for a high-dose statin became apparent after the CT scan. But what about you and the millions of men with a similar family history or a somewhat elevated LDL level?
        Here's the discussion I would have with a man like you, who has a higher-than-ideal LDL level and is asking about increasing his statin dose or might not be on a statin yet.
        If you desire to maximally reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke, aim for an LDL level of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). This means lifestyle changes, including a healthier diet and more physical activity. But you might also want to talk with your doctor about starting a low-dose statin or raising the dose if you already take one.
        An alternative is to have a coronary artery CT scan to get your coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. The test calculates the amount of calcium deposited in your coronary arteries. A zero score means a very low risk of trouble, and a high score means you might aim for an LDL level of 55 mg/dL or lower (the European Society of Cardiology recommendation for people at very high risk).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/a-three-pronged-approach-to-exercise,A three-pronged approach to exercise,"There's no question that getting regular exercise ranks as one of the leading strategies — if not the best one — for preventing heart disease. All forms of physical activity, even in small doses, can make a difference. But if you're looking to optimize your cardiovascular health, a regimen that includes three types of movement may be the way to go, according to a 2024 review article in Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine.
        The foundation of this exercise triad is moderate-intensity aerobic (cardio) exercise like brisk walking, one of the go-to options for meeting the federal activity guidelines (see ""Exercise recommendations and examples""). Moderate activity benefits your heart by burning calories and boosting metabolism, which helps control weight. But you can reap additional benefits by adding vigorous aerobic activity (the type that really gets your heart pumping) along with muscle-strengthening exercises.
        
          
            
              
                Exercise recommendations and examples
                Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity (or an equivalent combination of the two). Do strength training at least two days per week — even 10 to 15 minutes per session can be effective.
                Your age, baseline fitness level, and health conditions all affect what workout is best for you. Ask your doctor for help creating a safe three-part workout to optimize your heart health.

        How aerobic exercise helps
        ""People who run or do similar types of vigorous exercise may have experienced a 'runner's high' either during or after their workout,"" says Dr. Tim Churchill, a cardiologist at the Cardiovascular Performance Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. That's because your body releases feel-good chemicals known as endorphins and endocannabinoids in response to intense exercise.
        Any kind of aerobic exercise, whether moderate or vigorous, also helps dampen the body's ""fight or flight"" response, which plays a role in chronic stress and anxiety. Aerobic exercise also spurs the release of adrenalin and related hormones that stimulate receptors in the heart to beat more frequently and forcefully. Over time, the heart becomes more efficient, requiring less effort to send blood through the body. And as more blood circulates through the body, blood vessels expand slightly and become more flexible.
        Why muscle-building matters
        Including muscle-building exercises in your weekly routine has a synergistic effect with aerobic exercise that can further enhance your heart health. Strength training can make your body more efficient at burning fat for energy. It also helps improve how your body responds to insulin, the hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels, Dr. Churchill says. That can help prevent or improve diabetes, a potent risk factor for heart disease. Strength training also promotes the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes and widens blood vessels. ""Your arteries are then better able to relax, which helps to maintain normal blood pressure,"" says Dr. Churchill.
        As the review article notes, combining strength with moderate-intensity and some vigorous aerobic exercise leads to greater reductions in resting heart rate, blood pressure, body weight, and body fat percentage than doing single forms of exercise. ""Exercise clearly improves a lot of specific markers related to cardiovascular disease. But when you add up all those individual effects, it still only accounts for about 50% of the overall health benefit related to doing regular physical activity,"" says Dr. Churchill. The elusive remaining 50% is why the decades-long quest to create ""exercise in a pill"" will probably never materialize, he adds.

Use acetone-free products. Also, each time you take off polish, examine your nails for changes that can suggest various health conditions. These signs include thickened, yellow nails; redness or swelling around the nails; or dark streaks, splitting, or misshapen nail beds. See your doctor if you notice any such issues.","Toni Golen, MD","May 1, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/is-your-walking-up-to-speed,Is your walking up to speed?,"Walking is one of the best ways for older adults to get their recommended 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week. It requires only a good pair of shoes and can accommodate almost any fitness level. But to ensure you get the most benefits from your walking workouts, you must put in the necessary effort.
        ""It's easy for fitness walking to turn into casual strolls,"" says Antonina Stevens, a physical therapist with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. ""In order to maintain the minimum level of effort, you must constantly challenge yourself, which means focusing on intensity.""
        Insight into intensity
        One way to measure your walking intensity is to use a target heart rate range. It works like this. First, estimate your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age in years from 220. A typical target heart rate for moderate-intensity exercise is between 65% and 75% of your estimated maximum heart rate. For example, a 60-year-old man would have an estimated maximum heart rate of 160 (220 minus 60). His target heart rate for moderate-intensity exercise would be between 104 and 120 heartbeats per minute.
        ""When you're walking, you want your heart rate to stay within this range during most of the workout,"" says Stevens.
        You can track your target heart rate with a smart watch, such as an Apple Watch or Fitbit, which measures heart rate from your pulse at the wrist. Or just check your pulse for 15 seconds and multiply by 4. Another option is to use the perceived exertion scale to rate your exertion from 1 to 10, with 1 being complete rest and 10 meaning you're working so hard that breathing is difficult. Moderate-intensity activity is 5 or 6. (See ""Walk and talk."") Perceived exertion is often a better measurement for people taking a beta blocker, which blunts the normal exercise-induced rise in heart rate.
        
          
            
              
                Walk and talk
                The perceived exertion scale helps you gauge your exercise intensity. For moderate-intensity workouts, aim for 5 to 6 on the scale.

        The need for speed
        There are many ways to increase and maintain intensity. The obvious one is to walk faster. But that doesn't mean taking longer strides, which actually can slow you down. Instead, focus on improving your walking form using the following strategies. Begin with the first one, ""Stand tall."" After about a week, add the next tip, continue for another week, and so on.
        Pay attention at the beginning of your walks to ensure you follow each tip, and then periodically check to see if you need to correct anything. Some changes may happen quickly, while others may take time to become a habit.
        Stand tall. Extend your spine as if you're being lifted from the crown of your head. Keep your shoulders back and down, not scrunched up toward your ears. Your stride is more powerful when your posture is aligned and your core muscles are activated. Standing tall will also help alleviate aches and pains in your upper and lower back and allow you to take deeper breaths for more energy.
        Bend your arms. You wouldn't run with your arms straight — it would slow you down. The same goes for walking. When you bend your arms, it's easier to swing them. And since your body likes to be in sync, your legs will speed up to stay in step with your arms. Bend your elbows 85° to 90° and swing your arms forward and back — not side to side or diagonally across your body.
        Land on your heel. A heel-to-toe walking motion makes it easier to walk faster than if your foot lands flat with each step. As your leg swings forward, your heel should be the first part of your foot that contacts the ground. Focus on keeping your toes up as you land. Roll through your foot from your heel to your toes as smoothly as possible. Finally, push off with your toes.
        Push off strong. Focus on really pushing off the ground to propel yourself forward. For maximum power, bend at the ball of your foot, raising your heel as if trying to show the person behind you the sole of your shoe.
        Take shorter, quicker steps. This is the remedy for the common mistake of overstriding (taking longer steps than usual). Instead, focus on shorter, quicker steps — placing your front leg directly under you as you fall into your next step. This allows for a smoother, rolling stride that makes it easier to shift your body weight to your front leg and swing your back leg forward. The result: a faster walking speed.
        Keep your front leg straight. Keep your leg straight (but not locked at the knee) from when your foot lands on the ground until it's under your body. This will prevent bouncing. You'll have a smoother stride and propel yourself forward more easily.
        
          
            
              
                Intensity workouts
                Here are two workouts that can help you walk at higher intensity.
                
                  Intervals. Walk at an easy-to-moderate pace for three to four minutes, then walk at a vigorous pace (target heart rate of 75% to 85%, or 7 to 9 on the perceived exertion scale) for 30 seconds to a minute, and then repeat the cycle for your allocated time. You can adjust the sequence as needed: When you start, walk slower for longer periods and walk briskly for a shorter time. Eventually, you can work up to longer brisk walking and shorter recovery periods.
                  Inclines. Walking up and down hills or stairs at a slower speed can make you work harder than walking faster on a flat surface. If you use a treadmill, gradually adjust the machine's incline grade to mimic slower uphill walking.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/sedentary-work-may-contribute-to-insomnia,Sedentary work may contribute to insomnia,"People with sedentary jobs — an estimated 80% of the workforce — have a much higher risk of experiencing insomnia compared with people who are active at work, according to a study published online Jan. 7, 2025, by the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology.
        Researchers surveyed nearly 1,300 people twice over a 10-year span, inquiring about their job schedules and physical activity levels while at work. They also asked about participants' sleep habits, identifying three sleep health categories: good sleepers, catch-up sleepers, and insomnia-like sleepers. Compared with active work, sedentary work was 37% likelier to lead to a variety of insomnia symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep, interrupted sleep, and frequent daytime tiredness. The findings also indicated that workers who fall into a pattern of poor sleep due to their job design can end up stuck in such unhealthy patterns for many years. Insomnia-like sleepers, for example, reported their symptoms persisted 10 years later, at the end of the study.
        People with sedentary jobs who move their bodies during the workday can help protect themselves against developing longstanding sleep problems, study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/will-diverticulitis-heal-on-its-own,Will diverticulitis heal on its own?,"Your doctor spotted diverticula in a previous colonoscopy, but you never thought the little pouches in your large intestine (colon) would turn into little devils. Now pain in your gut is telling you something is wrong. Do you have diverticulitis, and will it get better without medical care?
        How it happens
        Diverticula develop when weak spots in the colon lining bulge outward, creating little pouches or potholes. They more often form in the sigmoid colon, which runs down the left side of the pelvis and then joins the rectum.
        ""Most people never have a problem with them. They're extremely common: they are present in about 70% of us by age 80,"" says Dr. Alexander Goldowsky, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        But sometimes diverticula bleed, or they become inflamed or infected, a condition called diverticulitis.
        Recognizing diverticulitis
        Diverticulitis tends to cause pain in the lower left part of your abdomen. ""It's not typical tummy trouble. It's a different kind of pain that can be significant and severe,"" Dr. Goldowsky says.
        Although diverticula rarely cause symptoms, diverticulitis can cause bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool. If a diverticulum is infected, you might have a fever, chills, or vomiting in addition to pain.
        ""If it's the first time you've had this kind of pain, reach out to your doctor right away,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""If you have a history of diverticulitis and you develop mild symptoms, let your doctor know. He or she may just recommend temporary dietary changes and taking it easy. But if things aren't improving, call your doctor again.""
        Don't put off calling; an infected diverticulum can form an abscess (pus-filled pocket) that can extend to other tissue in the body and become life-threatening. In rare cases, that new colon pain may indicate cancer.
        Diagnosis
        After you've alerted your doctor about gut pain, you'll need to go in for a physical exam. This exam can involve checking your abdomen for tenderness and the rectum for signs of blood. You  might need blood and stool tests.
        But the main way to diagnose diverticulitis is with a CT scan, typically after a special type of contrast dye is injected into your vein. ""If we see inflammation surrounding one or more diverticula, we can determine that you have diverticulitis,"" Dr. Goldowsky says.
        Treatment
        Can diverticulitis heal on its own? ""Yes, it can, and for that reason, we don't always prescribe antibiotics. We reserve them for diverticulitis in people with an abscess, a significant amount of inflammation, symptoms that aren't improving, a suppressed immune system, frailty, or other health problems — such as liver or kidney disease,"" Dr. Goldowsky says.
        Care at home, with or without an antibiotic, includes rest, a clear liquid diet (see ""A liquid diet for diverticulitis""), and acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain. You might want to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), which can add to gastrointestinal discomfort.
        For severe diverticulitis, you might need to be hospitalized for a few days, getting antibiotics directly into a vein. If you have an abscess, you might need surgery to clean out the infection.
        
          
            
              
                A liquid diet for diverticulitis
                When you have diverticulitis, you might need a clear liquid diet, to give your colon a break from digesting solid foods.
                A liquid diet can include clear drinks and foods, such as water, broth or bouillon, black coffee, plain tea, clear juice (apple, white grape), clear soft drinks or sports drinks, Jell-O, or popsicles.
                There's no need to stay on a liquid diet for more than 48 hours unless recommended by your doctor.
              
            
          
        
        Getting better
        Healing from diverticulitis requires commitment. If you're taking an oral antibiotic, make sure you stick to the medication schedule. If you're on a liquid diet, avoid cheating.
        Once symptoms begin improving, you can move to a low-fiber diet. It includes animal protein (eggs, cheese, fish, poultry); certain cooked vegetables (carrots, green beans, potatoes, pumpkin, yams, or squash); low-fiber fruits (bananas, peaches, pears); and (if your doctor says it's okay) low-fiber breads such as white, sourdough, or refined wheat breads. Stay away from spicy, fatty foods and alcohol.
        If you feel up to it, it's okay to exercise, but go easy on yourself. ""Avoid abdominal exercise. Go for a walk or do some arm exercises with small dumbbells,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""If you feel uncomfortable, take a break."" And buckle in: it could be 10 days before your symptoms go away completely.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/counting-steps-is-good-is-combining-steps-and-heart-rate-better-202504173095,Counting steps is good — is combining steps and heart rate better?,"Have you met your step goals today? If so, well done! Monitoring your step count can inspire you to bump up activity over time.
        But when it comes to assessing fitness or cardiovascular disease risk, counting steps might not be enough. Combining steps and average heart rate (as measured by a smart device) could be a better way for you to assess fitness and gain insights into your risk for major illnesses like heart attack or diabetes. Read on to learn how many steps you need for better health, and why tagging on heart rate matters.
        Steps alone versus steps plus heart rate
        First, how many steps should you aim for daily? There's nothing special about the 10,000-steps number often touted: sure, it sounds impressive, and it's a nice round number that has been linked to certain health benefits. But fewer daily steps — 4,000 to 7,000 — might be enough to help you become healthier. And taking more than 10,000 steps a day might be even better.
        Second, people walking briskly up and down hills are getting a lot more exercise than those walking slowly on flat terrain, even if they take the same number of steps.
        So, at a time when millions of people are carrying around smartphones or wearing watches that monitor physical activity and body functions, might there be a better way than just a step count to assess our fitness and risk of developing major disease?
        According to a new study, the answer is yes.
        Get out your calculator: A new measure of health risks and fitness
        Researchers publishing in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that a simple ratio that includes both heart rate and step count is better than just counting steps. It's called the DHRPS, which stands for daily heart rate per step. To calculate it, take your average daily heart rate and divide it by your average daily step count. Yes, to determine your DHRPS you'll need a way to continuously monitor your heart rate, such as a smartwatch or Fitbit. And you'll need to do some simple math to arrive at your DHRPS ratio, as explained below.
        The study enrolled nearly 7,000 people (average age: 55). Each wore a Fitbit, a device that straps onto the wrist and is programmed to monitor steps taken and average heart rate each day. (Fitbits also have other features such as reminders to be active, a tracker of how far you've walked, and sleep quality, but these weren't part of this study.)
        Over the five years of the study, volunteers took more than 50 billion steps. When each individual's DHRPS was calculated and compared with their other health information, researchers found that higher scores were linked to an increased risk of
        
          type 2 diabetes
          high blood pressure (hypertension)
          coronary atherosclerosis, heart attack, and heart failure
          stroke.
        
        The DHRPS had stronger associations with these diseases than either heart rate or step count alone. In addition, people with higher DHRPS scores were less likely to report good health than those who had the lowest scores. And among the 21 study subjects who had exercise stress testing, those with the highest DHRPS scores had the lowest capacity for exercise.
        What counts as a higher score in this study?
        In this study, DHRPS scores were divided into three groups:
        
          Low: 0.0081 or lower
          Medium: higher than 0.0081 but lower than 0.0147
          High: 0.0147 or higher.
        
        How to make daily heart rate per step calculations
        Here's how it works. Let's say that over a one-month period your average daily heart rate is 80 and your average step count is 4,000. That means your DHRPS equals 80/4,000, or 0.0200. If the next month your average heart rate is still 80 but you take about 6,000 steps a day, your DHRPS is 80/6,000, or 0.0133. Since lower scores are better, this is a positive trend.
        Should you start calculating your DHRPS?
        Do the results described in this study tempt you to begin monitoring your DHRPS? You may decide to hold off until further research confirms actual health benefits from knowing that ratio.
        This study merely explored the relationship between DHRPS and risk of diabetes or cardiovascular disease like heart attack or stroke. This type of study can only establish a link between the DHRPS and disease. It can't determine whether a higher score actually causes them.
        Here are four other limitations of this research to keep in mind:
        
          Participants in this study were likely more willing to monitor their activity and health than the average person. And more than 70% of the study subjects were female and more than 80% were white. The results could have been quite different outside of a research setting and if a more diverse group had been included.
          The findings were not compared to standard risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as having a strong family history of cardiovascular disease or smoking cigarettes. Nor were DHRPS scores compared with standard risk calculators for cardiovascular disease. So the value of DHRPS compared with other readily available (and free) risk assessments isn't clear.
          The exercise stress testing findings were based on only 21 people. That's far too few to make definitive conclusions.
          The cost of a device to continuously monitor heart rate and steps can run in the hundreds of dollars; for many this may be prohibitive, especially since the benefits of calculating the DHRPS are unproven.
        
        The bottom line
        Tracking DHRPS or daily activity and other health measures might be a way to improve your health if the results prompt you to make positive changes in behavior, such as becoming more active. Or perhaps DHRPS could one day help your health care provider monitor your fitness, better assess your health risks, and recommend preventive approaches. But we don't yet know if this new measure will actually lead to improved health because the study didn't explore that.
        If you already have a device that continuously monitors your daily heart rate and step count, feel free to do the math! Maybe knowing your DHRPS will motivate you to do more to lower your risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Or maybe it won't. We need more research and experience with this measure to know whether it can deliver on its potential to improve health.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","April 17, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-stress-busters-to-help-your-heart,5 stress busters to help your heart,"Easing stress is one key to a healthier heart
        Stress that persists day in and day out — whether from a traffic-choked daily commute, unhappy relationship, or heavy workload — has been linked to a wide range of health issues. Many people know first-hand that chronic stress can negatively affect mood, sleep, and appetite. But you may not know that chronic stress can harm your heart –– or understand what you can do to counter its effects. 
        How does long-term stress harm the heart?
        Chronic stress leads to persistent low-grade inflammation in the body, which increases the risk of heart disease. Mood, sleep, and appetite changes brought on by the constant hum of stress can do so, too.    
        And stress may influence your risk of heart attack and other heart conditions in more subtle ways. For example, when under stress, some of us eat unhealthy food or lack the energy or time to exercise. Stress can also trigger heart-damaging behaviors such as smoking and drinking too much alcohol.
        5 great ways to destress
        Breaking the connection between chronic stress and heart disease requires finding tools that can help you cope with stress and aim for healthier habits. These five simple tips can help you do just that.
        
          Tap into laughter. Laughter has been found to lower levels of stress hormones and reduce inflammation in the arteries. Silly shows, corny jokes, and funny animal videos all count!
          Meditate. Finding time for a simple combination of inward-focused thought and deep breathing reduces heart disease risk factors such as high blood pressure. Meditative practices like yoga, tai chi, mindfulness, and prayer can also relax the mind and body.
          Try activity. Every time you are physically active, whether you take a walk or play tennis, your brain releases mood-boosting chemicals called endorphins. Short bursts of exercise can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. And exercising regularly not only helps you ease stress, it also protects against heart disease by lowering your blood pressure, strengthening your heart muscle, and helping you maintain a healthy weight.
          Unplug. It's impossible to escape stress when it follows you everywhere. Cut the cord. Avoid emails and TV news. Take time each day — even if it's for just 10 or 15 minutes — to escape from the world.
          Find ways to destress. Simple things, like a relaxing bath, listening to music, spending time in nature or on a favorite hobby, can give you a much-needed break from the stressors in your life.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-does-ozempic-work-understanding-glp-1s-for-diabetes-weight-loss-and-beyond,"How does Ozempic work? Understanding GLP-1s for diabetes, weight loss, and beyond","Ozempic and other GLP-1 receptor agonists have gained attention for their role in treating type 2 diabetes and promoting weight loss. These medications mimic a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar and appetite. While their benefits are clear, they also come with potential risks and side effects.

How do GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic work?

GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists are a class of medications that work by mimicking the natural GLP-1 hormone. This hormone is released by the gut in response to eating and has several effects that help regulate blood sugar levels, hunger, and slow digestion. Tirzepatide is a related drug that mimics GLP-1 as well as a hormone called a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).

Most GLP-1 drugs are administered by injection into the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.

How do GLP-1s help manage diabetes?

For people with type 2 diabetes, controlling blood sugar levels is essential to preventing complications like nerve damage, kidney disease, and heart problems. GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide (Ozempic), liraglutide (Victoza), and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) help by increasing insulin secretion in response to meals, thereby lowering blood sugar levels. They also lower levels of glucagon, a hormone that raises blood sugar.

GLP-1 drugs lower blood sugar only when it's high, unlike insulin, which works regardless of glucose levels. This glucose-dependent action reduces the risk of dangerously low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), making them a safer option compared to some other diabetes treatments

GLP-1 receptor agonists also reduce the likelihood of developing heart-related problems such as heart attacks or strokes. This is an important consideration because diabetes increases heart disease risk.

How do GLP-1s support weight loss?

One of the reasons GLP-1 receptor agonists have gained so much attention is their ability to help with weight loss. These medications slow down stomach emptying, keeping you feeling full longer. They also send signals to the brain that increase feelings of fullness, leading to reduced food intake.

GLP-1s are typically prescribed at a higher dose for obesity than for diabetes. Liraglutide (Saxenda), semaglutide (Wegovy), and tirzepatide (Zepbound) are all FDA-approved for weight loss.

In some studies, participants using GLP-1s have lost an average of 10% to 15% of their body weight over a year. The most effective GLP-1 medications can lead to weight loss of over 20% of body weight. This level of weight loss is significant because even a 5% to 10% reduction in body weight can improve metabolic health, lower blood pressure, and decrease the risk of conditions like fatty liver disease and obstructive sleep apnea.

Side effects you may experience with GLP-1s

Like any medication, GLP-1 receptor agonists may cause side effects in some people. These side effects often improve as the body adjusts to the medication. To minimize them, doctors typically start with a low dose and gradually increase it over time. Some of the most common GLP-1 side effects include:


	nausea
	vomiting
	diarrhea
	constipation
	abdominal discomfort.


Other less common but possible side effects include headaches, increased heart rate, dizziness, and fatigue. Some individuals may also experience mild injection site reactions such as redness or itching.

Dr. Chika Anekwe, Obesity Medicine Clinical Director at Massachusetts General Hospital Weight Center and instructor at Harvard Medical School, points out that a common misconception is that everyone experiences major side effects. ""While gastrointestinal side effects like nausea and constipation are common, they are usually temporary and manageable,"" she notes.

Possible risks of GLP-1s

While GLP-1 drugs are generally considered safe, they do come with potential risks. Persistent nausea or vomiting can lead to dehydration, kidney problems, or malnutrition in some cases. People with serious gastrointestinal conditions, like gastroparesis or uncontrolled inflammatory bowel disease, should not take GLP-1 medications. And these medications are not considered safe for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

Other health risks include:


	Pancreatitis: Some studies suggest a possible link between GLP-1s and inflammation of the pancreas, though the risk appears to be low.
	Gallbladder problems: Some people develop gallstones or gallbladder inflammation while taking GLP-1s. (Gallstones can also result from rapid weight loss in the absence of GLP-1 medication.)
	Thyroid tumors: Animal studies have raised concerns about a potential link between GLP-1s and thyroid tumors, but ongoing surveillance has not shown that this applies to humans.
	Muscle loss: Some reports suggest that rapid weight loss from GLP-1s may lead to a decrease in muscle mass. (Weight loss even without GLP-1 medication results in some loss of muscle.) This is of particular concern for older adults, who may be at a higher risk for frailty and falls.


If you are taking or considering a GLP-1, discuss these risks with your doctor. There may be things you can do to mitigate some of these risks. For example, your doctor may advise you to increase your protein intake to reduce the risk of muscle loss.

Finally, beware of compounded GLP-1 drugs, which became popular during a GLP-1 drug shortage starting in 2022. The FDA has issued warnings about compounded GLP-1 drugs because of reports of harmful side effects. The FDA does not check compounded drugs for safety, effectiveness, or quality.

Potential benefits of GLP-1s under investigation

Beyond diabetes and weight loss, researchers are exploring other potential benefits of GLP-1 drugs. Major areas of exploration include:


	Heart health. Heart health remains a major area of interest. Research has suggested GLP-1s may reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with diabetes or obesity.
	Brain health. Research is ongoing to determine whether these drugs could help protect against neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Dr. Anekwe highlights that ""some research shows GLP-1s may slow cognitive decline and have a role in neuroprotection.""
	Addiction treatment. Some early studies suggest GLP-1 drugs may help reduce cravings for substances like alcohol and nicotine.
	Liver disease. Metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), are conditions linked to obesity and insulin resistance. GLP-1 drugs may help reduce liver fat and inflammation, potentially slowing disease progression.
	Sleep apnea. In December 2024, the FDA approved tirzepatide (Zepbound) to treat moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity.


""The most notable benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonists for patients with diabetes or obesity are their ability to promote significant weight loss, reduction in appetite, and improvement in blood sugar control,"" says Dr. Anekwe. She continues, ""The cardiovascular protection and other emerging benefits, such as improvements in outcomes related to metabolic-associated liver disease and obstructive sleep apnea, are additional benefits of these medications.""","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","April 14, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/zinc-what-it-does-for-the-body-and-the-best-food-sources,"Zinc: What it does for the body, and the best food sources","The word zinc may conjure images of cold remedies and sunblock. But dietary zinc, found in a variety of foods including seafood, meat, and fortified breakfast cereal, is an important nutrient that plays a vital role in many of the body's functions.
        What is zinc?
        Zinc is a trace mineral that's essential for the proper functioning of the human body. ""Since we cannot produce zinc as an element, we have to eat it,"" says Teresa Fung, a registered dietitian and adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. Foods including beef, shrimp, and pumpkin seeds contain high levels of the nutrient.
        Benefits of zinc: What does zinc do for the body?
        Zinc is vital for normal immune system function and wound healing. In addition, the body needs zinc for bone growth, the production of hormones such as insulin and testosterone, sperm production, and fetal development. Your body also needs zinc in order to smell and taste.
        How much zinc do you need each day?
        The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for zinc is 11 milligrams (mg) per day for adult men and 8 mg per day for adult women. For pregnant or lactating women, the RDA is 11 mg per day and 12 mg per day, respectively.
        What happens if you don't get enough zinc?
        Symptoms of zinc deficiency include slow wound healing, poor oral health, loss of taste and smell, skin lesions, hair loss, poor immune response, and diarrhea. Children with zinc deficiency may suffer delayed growth, as well as diarrhea and frequent infections. All of these symptoms, however, could also be the result of other disorders or deficiencies. The only way to confirm deficiency is with a blood test to measure zinc levels in the blood.
        The risk of zinc deficiency is higher in older adults, as well as in people who eat a plant-based diet, women who are pregnant or nursing, people with gastrointestinal disorders like Crohn's disease and celiac disease, and those who have had bariatric surgery. Overall, zinc deficiency is rare in the U.S.
        Foods high in zinc
        Nonvegetarian foods tend to be higher in zinc, with oysters and beef topping the list. Compared to other vegetarian foods, lentils, pumpkin seeds, cheese, and cashews are good sources of zinc. Fortified cereals contain higher levels of zinc as well.

        Should you take a zinc supplement?
        Most people, including vegetarians, can consume enough zinc through a balanced and varied diet. Your doctor may recommend a supplement if a blood test indicates your levels are low. If you are zinc deficient, you may also need further evaluation to identify and then address the underlying cause of your deficiency.
        Some people swear by Cold-EEZE, a lozenge containing zinc gluconate, to reduce common cold duration and symptoms. But studies haven't consistently shown it to help that much, or at all. In addition, in one study, the majority of people who used zinc lozenges suffered adverse effects like nausea and bad taste. Zinc nasal sprays may also cause loss of smell. Zinc supplements may interfere with the effectiveness of quinolone and tetracycline antibiotics, so tell your doctor if you are taking a supplement.
        Risks of too much zinc
        It's hard to consume too much zinc from food. If you are taking a supplement, avoid exceeding the upper safety limit of 40 mg per day. Risks of too much zinc include stomach pain, headaches, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.",Rachael Moeller Gorman,"April 7, 2025"

The brain's ability to adapt and rewire itself — known as neuroplasticity — plays a crucial role in keeping our minds sharp.
        While aging can bring natural changes to the brain, engaging in specific activities and lifestyle choices can help preserve and even enhance cognitive function. Understanding neuroplasticity and incorporating brain-boosting habits into daily life can support mental agility and overall brain health.
        What is neuroplasticity and what's the connection to cognitive fitness?
        Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt throughout life by modifying its structure, functions, or neural pathways.
        Dr. Andrew E. Budson, Chief of Cognitive & Behavioral Neurology at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System and chair of the Science of Learning Innovation Group at Harvard Medical School, explains, ""Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to learn, remember, and change when it is appropriate for the circumstances."" This adaptability allows the brain to reorganize itself in response to learning, experiences, and environmental influences.
        Cognitive fitness — the ability to think, learn, and remember effectively — depends on a healthy and adaptable brain. By actively engaging in behaviors that support neuroplasticity, you can strengthen cognitive function and potentially reduce the risk of age-related decline.
        Keys to cognitive fitness
        Maintaining cognitive fitness involves a combination of mental, physical, and social activities. Each of these factors plays a role in supporting neuroplasticity and promoting lifelong brain health.
        A healthy body supports a healthy brain. This means it is important to manage your health conditions.
        Lifestyle choices are also crucial. Maintaining cognitive fitness as you age is best achieved by combining these key approaches:
        
          Eat a brain-healthy diet.
          Engage in regular physical activity.
          Prioritize quality sleep.
          Challenge your brain.
          Nurture social connections.
          Manage stress.
        
        How physical activity supports cognitive health
        Exercise is not just beneficial for the body — it also has a powerful impact on the brain. Neuroplasticity is closely linked to the production of neurotrophins, a group of proteins that play a vital role in brain cell growth and function. Among the key neurotrophins involved in neuroplasticity is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Research suggests that lower levels of BDNF may contribute to cognitive decline, affecting memory, concentration, and learning ability.
        Dr. Budson highlights that aerobic exercise plays a critical role in promoting neuroplasticity, as it triggers the release of brain growth factors. He states, ""From the perspective of the body, we know that brain growth factors are released when we engage in aerobic exercise, so that is critically important.""
        The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week. Greater cognitive health benefits are seen at higher levels.
        Physical activity — both aerobic exercise and strength training — also increases blood flow to the brain and reduces stress and inflammation. Together, these changes improve mood, memory, focus, and processing speed, helping to preserve cognitive function and potentially reduce the risk of dementia, particularly in older adults.
        Nutrition and brain health
        A nutritious diet plays a significant role in maintaining cognitive function. Although the brain makes up only 2% of body weight, it utilizes 20% of the body's energy.
        The Mediterranean diet has been associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline. This diet  emphasizes fruits, green leafy vegetables, whole grains, fish, legumes, nuts, and healthy fats like extra virgin olive oil.
        Another diet — the MIND diet —  incorporates elements of the Mediterranean and DASH diets. According to a study published in the journal Neurology, it may slow cognitive decline compared to other eating patterns. The MIND diet emphasizes plant-based foods and limits consumption of animal products and saturated fats. It highlights green leafy vegetables, nuts, berries, poultry, and fish.
        On the flip side, high-fat, high-refined-sugar diets have been linked to decreased BDNF and neuroplasticity. Avoiding excessive sugar and processed foods can also help maintain mental clarity and prevent inflammation that may contribute to poor brain health.
        Challenge your brain to boost neuroplasticity
        Just as physical exercise strengthens muscles, mental challenges help keep the brain sharp. Research shows that engaging in diverse, stimulating activities supports brain health by promoting neuroplasticity.
        Lifelong learning plays a key role in cognitive fitness by strengthening neural connections and enhancing cognitive reserve — the brain's ability to maintain function despite aging or disease. This reserve builds over time through education, career experiences, and mentally engaging activities, acting as a defense against cognitive decline.
        Dr. Budson suggests engaging in learning-based activities such as taking an adult education course, picking up a new hobby, or even reading books that introduce new concepts. ""Meeting new people and learning about them is a great way to enhance neuroplasticity, as is traveling to a new place,"" he adds.
        By regularly challenging your mind, you can strengthen neural pathways and support long-term brain health. Here are some additional ways to keep your brain active:
        
          Try something new. Learning a new language, instrument, or skill (like painting or cooking) forms fresh neural connections.
          Challenge yourself. Increase the difficulty of puzzles, games, or reading material to continuously build cognitive reserve.
          Mix up mental workouts. Avoid routine by incorporating different activities like strategy games, creative hobbies, and problem-solving exercises.
          Engage in cultural and social activities. Attending concerts, museums, or plays stimulates the brain and encourages deeper learning.
          Travel and explore. Visiting new places, even locally, enhances brain plasticity by exposing you to novel experiences.
          Enjoy music and movement. Playing an instrument, dancing, or even listening to music supports cognitive and emotional well-being.
        
        Prioritize sleep for brain health
        Quality sleep is essential for cognitive function and memory consolidation. During sleep, the brain processes and stores information, clears out toxins, and repairs neural pathways.
        Dr. Budson explains, ""There is now a tremendous body of evidence that memories are consolidated during sleep. Memory consolidation is the process of short-term memories turning into long-term memories."" He highlights that sleep not only strengthens important memories, but also helps regulate emotions and integrate new knowledge with prior experiences, making it crucial for neuroplasticity.
        Despite common belief, your sleep needs don't decrease as you age. Adults in their 70s and beyond still require seven to nine hours per night. However, changes in sleep patterns can make it more challenging. As you get older, you may fall asleep and wake up earlier, struggle to drift off, or experience more frequent awakenings during the night. It's fine to take a short nap during the day, which counts toward your total sleep.
        Try these sleep-improving strategies:
        
          Stick to a schedule. Wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, even on weekends.
          Get morning sunlight. Exposure to natural light early in the day helps regulate sleep cycles.
          Exercise regularly. Physical activity improves sleep quality, but avoid intense workouts close to bedtime.
          Watch your diet. Eat a light dinner and avoid caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, and nicotine before bed.
          Limit screen time. Turn off electronics at least an hour before bed to reduce blue light exposure.
          Create a sleep-friendly environment. Keep your bedroom cool, dark, quiet, and comfortable.
          Establish a bedtime routine. Engage in calming activities like reading, stretching, meditation, or deep breathing.
        
        Chronic sleep deprivation can impair concentration, decision-making, and long-term brain health. If you regularly struggle to fall or stay asleep, talk to your doctor to identify the cause and explore the best treatment options.
        Reduce stress for a brain boost
        Chronic stress can take a toll on brain function by increasing levels of cortisol, a hormone that can damage neurons and inhibit neuroplasticity. However, practicing effective stress management techniques can help protect cognitive health and support long-term brain function.
        One particularly effective approach is mindfulness meditation. Research suggests that regular meditation promotes structural and functional changes in brain regions responsible for attention, emotional regulation, and memory. While research is ongoing, meditation is believed to support neuroplasticity by fostering the growth of new brain cells and connections, potentially mitigating the harmful effects of stress.
        In addition to meditation, other stress-reducing strategies include deep breathing exercises, listening to music, and spending time in nature. By incorporating these techniques into daily life, you can help reduce stress while supporting overall brain health and cognitive function.
        Social engagement and mental sharpness
        Staying socially connected is essential for preserving memory and cognitive function as you age. Research shows that those with active social lives are less likely to experience cognitive decline compared to individuals who are more isolated.
        Engaging in conversations and interactive activities stimulates key mental processes like attention and memory. Regular social interaction helps reinforce neural connections, slowing age-related decline and potentially delaying dementia by strengthening cognitive reserve.
        To support brain health, consider these engaging ways to stay socially active:
        
          traveling to new places
          attending cultural events such as theater, concerts, or art exhibitions
          joining social or retirement groups
          spending quality time with family and friends.
        
        By making social engagement a priority, you can help protect cognitive function while enjoying meaningful connections and experiences.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","April 2, 2025"
