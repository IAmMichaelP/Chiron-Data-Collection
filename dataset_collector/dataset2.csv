https://www.eaglenews.ph/zimbabwe-reports-first-two-mpox-cases-of-unspecified-variant/,Zimbabwe reports first two mpox cases of unspecified variant,1,"HARARE (Reuters) – Zimbabwe has confirmed its first two cases of mpox, the health ministry said on Sunday, without specifying which variant had been recorded. The first case was detected in an 11-year-old boy who developed symptoms last month after travelling to South Africa, the statement said. The second case was in a 24-year-old man who fell ill after travelling to Tanzania, it said. Both patients are recovering and contact tracing is underway, the statement said. The cases were in capital Harare and the southern town of Mberengwa. The World Health Organization in August declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, as a new variant of the viral infection spread from Democratic Republic of Congo to neighbouring African countries.The new “clade 1b” variant has caused global concern as it seems to spread more easily though routine close contact.“The Ministry of Health and Childcare wishes to reassure the public that the situation is under control and urges the Zimbabwean public not to panic,” said the statement signed by Health Minister Douglas Mombeshora. Neighbouring Zambia also reported its first case last week without disclosing the strain. Mpox typically causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild but can kill.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/cuba-faces-uphill-battle-as-oropouche-virus-spreads/,Cuba faces uphill battle as Oropouche virus spreads,1,"HAVANA (Reuters) – Cuban health authorities launched small-scale fumigation efforts in Havana on Friday to fight the spread of the Oropouche virus, but a rainy Caribbean summer, fuel shortages and growing roadside trash heaps are complicating those efforts, workers and officials said.More than 500 cases of the virus have been registered since May when the disease was first detected in far-eastern Cuba, health officials said this week.The virus, also known as sloth fever, is transmitted by the bite of mosquitoes and midges and has spread quickly across all of the country’s provinces and major cities, including the capital Havana. Patients complain of fever, body aches and nausea, though the disease is rarely fatal.Fumigation workers using hand-held, gas-powered blowers fired smoke into dark corners and alleyways in parts of Havana on Friday, though those efforts have been stymied, in part, by limited resources.“In the past, all the blocks were fumigated every week … but now, due to fuel (shortages), they focus on specific cases where (fever outbreaks) occur,” said Havana fumigation worker Luís Aguilar.U.S. health authorities earlier this week said 21 U.S. citizens who had visited Cuba during the summer months returned home with cases of Oropouche.Cuba has reported relatively few cases compared to other countries, including Brazil, where the virus is also present, and no fatalities.But economic crisis and shortages of fuel, food and medicine have hampered efforts to control the spread of such mosquito-borne illnesses as Oropouche and Dengue fever, authorities have said.Frequent power outages mean many sleep with windows open during the hot Caribbean summer, and few Cubans have access to insect repellent.Trash heaps have grown in size on street corners, which, combined with summer rains, provide ample breeding grounds for biting insects, authorities said.There are no specific treatments or vaccines available for Oropouche.(Reporting by Carlos Carrillo and Alien Fernandez; Editing by Dave Sherwood and Stephen Coates)"

Authorities are also monitoring 43 people in the country who may come into contact with the patient, he said.The director-general did not name the African country the man had been in. He said the man had transited in a Middle Eastern country, which he also did not name, before flying on to Thailand.Thailand has detected 800 case of mpox Clade 2 since 2022, but so far not detected a case of the Clade 1 or Clade 1b variants.(Reporting by Pararat Thepgumpanat and Panu Wongcha-um; Editing by Martin Petty, Tom Hogue and John Mair)"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/africa-could-start-mpox-vaccinations-within-days-health-agency-says/,Africa could start mpox vaccinations within days,1,"By Anait MiridzhanianThe Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and other African countries could start vaccinating against mpox within days, Africa’s top public health agency said on Tuesday.The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has been working with countries experiencing mpox outbreaks on logistics and communication strategies to roll out vaccine doses that are due to arrive following pledges by the European Union, vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic, the United States and Japan. The World Health Organization last week declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years as a new variant of the disease spread rapidly in Africa.“We didn’t start vaccinations yet. We’ll start in a few days, if we are sure that everything is in place. End of next week vaccines will start to arrive in DRC and other countries,” Africa CDC Director General Jean Kaseya told a briefing.“We need to make sure that the supply chain management, the logistics are ready…to ensure that this vaccine will be safely stored and can be safely administered to people who need them.”He said studies on the efficacy of different vaccines would continue in Africa while shots are being administered, so countries better understand which shots are appropriate in their context.African states reported more than 1,400 additional mpox cases over the past week, taking the total number of cases in the 12 African countries where mpox has been detected to almost 19,000 since the start of the 2024, an Africa CDC presentation showed.Cases are up more than 100% on the same period last year, and Kaseya said it was too early to say mpox outbreaks on the continent were improving.Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and flu-like symptoms, is usually mild but can kill. More than one strain is spreading simultaneously in Africa.Kaseya said African countries wanted solidarity, rather than being treated unfairly like during the COVID-19 pandemic.“I clearly request our partners to stop thinking about travel bans against Africans, that one will bring us back on the unfair treatment that we had during the COVID time,” he said.“Solidarity means we need you to provide appropriate support in terms of medical counter-measures,” he added, saying African countries needed help increasing their testing rate as well as accessing vaccines.

A case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent.“As of now, there have been no reported cases of clade I in Pakistan,” said Sajid Hussain Shah, spokesman for the ministry of national health services.The World Health Organization declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified.The WHO last week sounded its highest level of alert over the outbreak in Africa after cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to nearby countries. There have been 27,000 cases and more than 1,100 deaths, mainly among children, in DR Congo since the current outbreak began in January 2023.Global health officials on last week confirmed an infection with the new strain of mpox in Sweden and linked it to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. The WHO did not urge any travel restrictions to curb the spread of mpox.The disease presents with flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild but can kill, and children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of complications.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/hong-kongs-dr-fauci-sounds-alarm-on-next-pandemic/,One case of clade 2 mpox detected in Pakistan,1,"By Xinqi SU – Hong Kong microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung has done battle with some of the world’s worst threats, including the SARS virus he helped isolate and identify. And he has a warning.Another pandemic is inevitable and could exact damage far worse than Covid-19, according to the soft-spoken scientist sometimes thought of as Hong Kong’s answer to top US health expert Anthony Fauci.“Both the public and (world) leaders must admit that another pandemic will come, and probably sooner than you anticipate,” he told AFP at the city’s Queen Mary Hospital, where he works and teaches.“Why I make such a horrifying prediction is because you can see clearly that the geopolitical, economic, and climatic changes are changing so rapidly,” he told AFP.Politicians must “come to their senses” and solve “global existential threats,” he warns in his new autobiography “My Life in Medicine: A Hong Kong Journey”.While world leaders are more focused on “national or regional interests”, Yuen said a rapidly changing climate coupled with emerging infectious diseases should be a top priority.“This is something so important that we should not ignore.” Yuen is a globally recognised authority on coronaviruses and infectious diseases, but he came from humble beginnings.Born in Hong Kong in the late 1950s, he grew up in a 60-square-foot subdivided flat with his parents and three brothers.Since graduating from medical school in 1981, he has worked in the city’s public hospitals, where doctors are paid far less than in the private sector.It was in 2003 when he leapt into the public consciousness, after he and his team successfully isolated and identified severe acute respiratory syndrome, better known as SARS.It was a vital step towards testing, diagnosing and treating the disease, which emerged in southern China and Hong Kong before spreading globally.The virus killed nearly 300 people in the city in just two months, a toll second only to mainland China.That experience informed Yuen’s approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, which ripped through Hong Kong due to lax vaccination, particularly among the elderly.“We benefited from the 20 years of study that followed the SARS outbreak,” he wrote in his book.“Until factors beyond our ability to stop or overcome — fear, ignorance, poor messaging, and deliberate misinformation — the measures were effective” in buying Hong Kong time until the vaccines were developed.In the end, despite tough lockdown measures and lengthy quarantines, Hong Kong recorded some three million infections — about half its population — and more than 13,800 deaths from Covid-19.It was a frenetic time for Yuen, who became a familiar face as the government’s go-to expert and penned more than 100 peer-reviewed studies on the virus.It also put him in a delicate position on several occasions, including when his call to lift restrictions in 2022 was rejected when the city stayed aligned with China’s zero-Covid doctrine of closed borders and quarantines.The self-described medical “detective” also faced complaints that put his license at risk after he described the seafood market in China’s Wuhan — where the first cluster of coronavirus cases was detected — as a “crime scene”. Today, Yuen chooses his words carefully and avoids political subjects, but he maintains that understanding the origins of Covid-19 is key.It is “important to properly do an investigation in a very open, transparent manner” so lessons can be learned for future pandemic prevention, he said.The World Health Organization has called on China to be more transparent about the pandemic’s origins, without making any firm conclusions on the source.Last year, Yuen set up the Pandemic Research Alliance with peers in mainland China and the United States to share information and research on future threats.“It is a bad idea to stop or inhibit these exchanges because it protects everyone,” he said.“If we do not talk about it… then another pandemic comes, we have to pay a huge price again.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/constant-blood-ukraines-frontline-medics-battle-exhaustion/,new strain not detected,1,"By Maryke VERMAAK – When Vitaliy signed up to join the Ukrainian army as a surgeon, he made a promise not to burn himself out, fearing he could be needed for a lengthy and bloody war.More than two years after Russia invaded and with the fighting showing no sign of subsiding, that promise is being put to the test.Vitaliy serves at a medical post in the Pokrovsk area of the Donetsk region, where Kyiv says the most intense Russian attacks across the entire front line are taking place.His job is to stabilise wounded soldiers so they stay alive long enough to make it to a proper hospital.The flow of the wounded is never-ending and the medics — like Kyiv’s outgunned troops — never get a break.“Not a day goes by where they (the Russians) do not press and advance … the enemy is attacking and advancing, pressing constantly,” said Vitaliy.“The guys are also sleep deprived, tired, exhausted,” he added.A call came in over the radio that a wounded soldier was on the way.Vitaly quickly put on his blue surgical gown and headlamp.Within 15 minutes the soldier, moaning from pain, arrived in an armoured vehicle and was carried into the facility on a stretcher. His vehicle had been hit in a drone attack.“They are in such bad shape and miserable when they get here that it breaks my heart,” Vitaliy said after treating the soldier. “You feel sorry for them.”One of the soldiers hit in the drone attack died.The man Vitaliy treated survived, but nothing could be done to save his hand, which was nearly completely torn off.The medical post is far from a safe haven, though.Stabilisation points are frequent targets for Russian strikes.“It’s like you are sitting on a powder keg,” Vitaliy said.“You are… waiting for something to hit you, because it is not far from the front line.”Vitaliy sighed as he recalled the danger. All he wanted to do, he added, was “hold my daughter in my arms”.Some frontline medics said their mental health had deteriorated so much that they would struggle to go back to a normal life.Asked how he coped, Andriy, a member of the evacuation team who had just brought in another wounded soldier, said: “I take anti-depressants.”He already suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), he said.The “constant blood and constant death” has changed him, the 46-year-old said, explaining that he struggled to fit into civilian life.“I can’t even fall asleep when it’s quiet anymore.”Despite the toll, Andriy remains committed to the work.The best part? Seeing “the eyes of the wounded as we take them out and bring them in alive.“Without good medicine there will be very big losses,” he said.But he knew the price he was paying was enormous.“We will not leave this war, either dead or alive.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/uks-princess-of-wales-makes-first-public-appearance-since-cancer-diagnosis/,‘Hong Kong’s Dr Fauci’ sounds alarm on next pandemic,1,"By Sylvain PEUCHMAURD, Joe JACKSON– Catherine, Princess of Wales, on Saturday tentatively returned to UK public life for the first time since being diagnosed with cancer, attending a military parade in London to mark King Charles III’s official birthday.Kate, as she is widely known, travelled in a state carriage alongside her three children at the outset of the annual event before watching the ceremonial proceedings from a viewing point.The 42-year-old future queen then appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony, to cheers from the crowds below who had braved torrential rain to turn out for the pageantry.It comes nearly three months after the princess revealed she was receiving chemotherapy treatment. She had not been seen at a public engagement since a Christmas Day service last year.In a Friday evening statement Kate said she was “making good progress” with her treatment, which is set to last for several more months, but was “not out of the woods yet”.“I’m looking forward to attending the King’s Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer,” the princess added.Kate’s cancer announcement came just weeks after it was disclosed that her father-in-law and British head of state Charles had also been diagnosed with the condition.Neither has revealed what type of cancer they have.Charles, 75, was given the green light to resume public duties in April, after doctors said they were “very encouraged” by his progress.His first engagement was meeting staff and patients at a London cancer treatment centre.Earlier this month, he attended commemoration events in northern France for the 80th anniversary of D-Day.However, unlike previous years when he inspected troops on horseback at Trooping the Colour, Charles participated this year from a carriage, in full military regalia alongside Queen Camilla.His elder son and heir William, 41, rode on horseback, also in military uniform.Kate, wearing a white dress and hat, was seen arriving by car at the palace with William and their children — Prince George, aged 10, Princess Charlotte, nine, and six-year-old Prince Louis — ahead of the parade.Proceedings then culminated several hours later in a fly-past by the Royal Air Force, featuring various aircraft including its aerobatic Red Arrows display team trailing red, white and blue vapours.Senior royals looked on from the balcony, with Kate smiling at points as she stood alongside other family members.Spectators welcomed her tentative return to public appearances.“I was so pleased to hear the news last night,” Angela Perry, a teacher in her 50s from Reading, told AFP.“She’s our future queen. She’s so important,” she added, calling Kate’s reemergence “reassuring”.Royal officials are keen to manage expectations about Kate’s gradual return to the public eye, and have maintained that her appearances will depend on her treatment and recovery.Kate explained in her statement that she had “good days and bad days” and was “taking each day as it comes”. Trooping the Colour marks the British sovereign’s official birthday and is a minutely choreographed military tradition dating back more than two centuries.It starts at Buckingham Palace and moves down The Mall to Horse Guards Parade, where Charles received a royal salute before inspecting soldiers.Charles was actually born in November but the second birthday tradition dates back to King George II in 1748, who wanted to have a celebration in better weather as his own birthday was in October.However, Saturday’s ceremony saw heavy downpours.The event has its origins in the preparations for war, where all regimental flags — or colours — were shown to the soldiers so that they would recognise them in the confusion of battle.This year’s parade included three of five military horses that bolted through the streets of central London in April after being spooked by the noise of building construction.London’s Metropolitan Police mounted a “significant” security operation and liaised with anti-monarchy group Republic, which staged a protest on The Mall.The force said it had banned “amplified sound” in and around the parade route on public safety grounds and to avoid disruption to the mounted regiments taking part.Republic’s activists chanted slogans and held aloft placards bearing slogans including “not my king” and “down with the crown” as the parade passed by."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/british-tv-presenter-michael-mosley-possibly-found-dead-on-greek-island/,‘Constant blood’: Ukraine’s frontline medics battle exhaustion,1,"– British diet guru and TV personality Michael Mosley was found dead on Sunday on the Greek island of Symi where he went missing this week, police said.“People on a boat saw a body close to the rocky coast,” said Petros Vassilakis, police chief for the southern Aegean region.The lifeless body was spotted by a television crew from Greece’s ERT public channel out filming in the area where the 67-year-old disappeared.A cameraman “saw something strange near the fence, 50 metres from the sea”, ERT reporter Aristides Miaoulis said on air.“We discovered it was this man… he was lying down (on his back).”Symi’s mayor Lefteris Papakalodoukas was also with the crew and confirmed they had found Mosley, who had been vacationing on the island.“It’s the body of the journalist that we have been looking for over several days,” he told ERT.The authorities had on Friday announced they were stepping up the search after the Briton was last seen alive on Wednesday.His wife Clare Bailey alerted police that evening when he failed to return from a coastal walk on his own.Papakalodoukas said Symi has been baking under “insufferable heat” and the area where Mosley was last sighted was “difficult because it’s very rocky”.Much of Greece has seen record temperatures for the first week of June, reaching 39.3 degrees Celsius (103 degrees Fahrenheit) on Symi, which is close to Rhodes and western Turkey.Tom Watson, a former deputy leader of the UK’s main opposition Labour party who lost weight with the help of one of Mosley’s books, paid tribute to a “hero” who produced “courageous, science-based journalism”.Mosley’s co-presenter on the BBC programme “Trust Me, I’m A Doctor”, Saleyha Ahsan, told BBC News he had a “passion” for making science “accessible to anyone and everyone”.Mosley trained as a doctor after working as an investment banker and joined the BBC as a trainee producer.He went on to make science and history documentaries and in the past decade carved out a niche as a health guru in front of the camera and as the author of best-selling diet books.The health journalist, credited with popularising the 5:2 intermittent fasting diet, appeared on TV programmes including “The One Show” and “This Morning”."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-confirms-first-fatal-human-case-of-h5n2-bird-flu/,UK’s Princess of Wales makes first public appearance since cancer diagnosis,1,"– A person died of bird flu in Mexico in the first confirmed case of a human infected with the H5N2 variant, the World Health Organization said Wednesday.The 59-year old, who died on April 24 after developing fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea and nausea, had “no history of exposure to poultry or other animals” and “multiple underlying medical conditions”, the WHO said in a statement.The resident of the State of Mexico was hospitalised in Mexico City and died the same day, the statement said.It was the “first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally”, the WHO added.Mexican health authorities reported the confirmed case to the UN health body on May 23 after conducting laboratory tests.The source of exposure to the virus was unknown, the WHO said, although cases of H5N2 have been reported in poultry in Mexico.H5N2 cases were detected in a backyard poultry farm in Michoacan state in March, with other outbreaks identified in the State of Mexico, according to the UN health body.But it said establishing a link between the human case and the poultry infections was so far impossible, estimating the risk to people as “low”.Mexico’s health ministry said in a statement that the person who died was “a 59-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, (and) long-standing systemic arterial hypertension”.“There is no risk of contagion for the population,” the statement said, adding that “all samples from identified contacts (of the patient) have been negative”.Authorities are monitoring farms near the victim’s home and have established a permanent monitoring system to detect other cases in wildlife in the area, the statement added.A different variant of bird flu, H5N1, has been spreading for weeks among dairy cow herds in the United States, with a small number of cases reported among humans.But none of the cases are human-to-human infections, with the disease instead jumping from cattle to people, authorities have said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/more-than-1-in-4-children-under-age-5-face-severe-food-poverty-unicef/,British TV presenter Michael Mosley found dead on Greek island,1,"By Amélie BOTTOLLIER-DEPOIS – More than one in four children under the age of five globally live in “severe” food poverty, UNICEF has warned — meaning more than 180 million are at risk of experiencing adverse impacts on their growth and development.“Severe child food poverty describes children who are surviving on severely deprived diets so they’re only consuming two or less food groups,” Harriet Torlesse, a lead writer of a new UNICEF report published late Wednesday, told AFP.“It is shocking in this day and age where we know what needs to be done.”UNICEF recommends that young children eat foods daily from five of eight main groups — breast milk; grains, roots, tubers and plantains; pulses, nuts and seeds; dairy; meat, poultry and fish; eggs; vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables; and other fruits and vegetables.But 440 million children under the age of five living in about 100 low- and middle-income countries are living in food poverty, meaning they do not have access to five food groups each day.Of those, 181 million are experiencing severe food poverty, eating from at most two food groups.“Children who consume just two food groups per day — for example, rice and some milk — are up to 50 percent more likely to experience severe forms of malnutrition,” UNICEF chief Catherine Russell said in a statement accompanying the report.That malnutrition can lead to emaciation, a state of being abnormally thin that can be fatal.And even if these children survive and grow up, “they certainly don’t thrive. So they do less well at school,” Torlesse explained.“When they’re adults, they find it harder to earn a decent income, and that turns the cycle of poverty from one generation to the next,” the nutrition expert said.“If you think of what a brain looks like and the heart and the immune system, all these important systems of the body that are so important for development, for protection against disease — they all depend on vitamins and minerals and protein.” Severe child food poverty is concentrated in about 20 countries, with particularly dire situations in: Somalia, where 63 percent of young children are affected; Guinea (54 percent); Guinea-Bissau (53 percent) and Afghanistan (49 percent).While data is not available for wealthy countries, children in low-income households there also suffer from nutritional gaps.The report from the UN Children’s Fund notes the current circumstances in the Gaza Strip, where Israel’s military offensive in response to the October 7 attack by Hamas militants “have brought the food and health systems to collapse.”From December to April this year, the agency collected five rounds of data by text message from families receiving financial aid in the besieged Palestinian territory.It showed that about nine in 10 children were living in severe food poverty.While the data is not necessarily representative, it indicates what UNICEF called an “appalling escalation in nutrition deprivation since 2020, when only 13 percent of children in the Gaza Strip were living in severe child food poverty.”Worldwide, the agency noted “slow progress over the past decade” in addressing the crisis, and called for better social services and humanitarian aid for the most vulnerable children.It also called for a rethink of the global food processing system, saying that sugary drinks and ultra-processed foods were being “aggressively marketed to parents and families and are the new normal for feeding children.”Torlesse explained: “These foods are cheap but they’re also very high in calories. They’re high-energy, high salt, high fat. So they’ll fill stomachs and they’ll remove hunger, but they won’t provide the vitamins and minerals that children need.”Sugary and salty foods — which children quickly develop a taste for, a habit they can take into adulthood — also contribute to the development of obesity."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/morocco-says-eight-dead-after-drinking-bootleg-alcohol/,WHO confirms first fatal human case of H5N2 bird flu,1,"– Eight people in Morocco have died and dozens of others were hospitalised after drinking homemade liquor, the health ministry said on Wednesday.“Serious complications from poisoning” led to the death of eight people in the town of Sidi Allal Tazi, about 100 kilometres (over 60 miles) north Rabat, said the regional health directorate.More than 100 people in the town suffered from alcohol poisoning between Monday and Wednesday from consuming methanol, it said in a statement, with the health of 81 still being monitored.Authorities said two suspects, aged 21 and 41, had been identified as those responsible for the bootleg alcohol and were among those hospitalised.Homemade alcohol caused seven deaths in central Morocco’s Meknes last year and 19 deaths in the northern city Ksar El Kebir in 2022.Moroccan law technically prohibits the sale of alcohol to Muslims, who make up 99 percent of the country’s population.But it can easily be found in bars, restaurants or even in licensed stores which offer it for sale behind opaque windows and thick curtains."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/sweden-orders-review-after-explosion-of-adhd-cases/,Sweden orders review after ‘explosion’ of ADHD cases,1,"– Sweden is seeing “an explosion” of ADHD cases among children that has put it far above the global average, the government said Friday as it ordered a review to find out why.Around 10.5 percent of boys and six percent of girls in Sweden in 2022 had been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed told reporters, citing statistics from the Board of Health and Welfare.The figures were expected to rise to 15 and 11 percent respectively before levelling off, he said, citing a forecast from the Swedish Medical Products Agency.Around five to seven percent of children worldwide have an ADHD diagnosis, the government said.“Sweden stands out in this context. The number of ADHD diagnoses has increased sharply over time… and shows no sign of abating,” Forssmed said.In addition, ADHD medications prescribed to boys aged 10 to 17 had increased by 800 percent over the past 15 years, from one percent of boys having a prescription in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.For girls the increase was tenfold, from 0.5 percent to around five percent.Forssmed ordered the Medical Products Agency and other concerned authorities to conduct a review to find out what was behind the surge.“More knowledge is needed,” he said.Since Sweden’s previous treatment recommendation was issued in 2016, “new medications have been developed, as well as new research and expanded indicators”, he said.Forssmed said some of the explanations that have been floated include “increased awareness among healthcare professionals, schools and the public (and) broader diagnosis criteria”.“There also seems to be a belief that a diagnosis has been a formal or informal prerequisite to be able to get extra help in school.”He said the review was part of the government’s plan to promote mental health and prevent suicide among children and youths."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/first-patient-to-get-gene-edited-pig-kidney-transplant-dies/,First patient to get gene-edited pig kidney transplant dies,1,"The first living patient to receive a genetically modified pig kidney transplant has died two months after the procedure, the US hospital that carried it out said.“Mass General is deeply saddened at the sudden passing of Mr. Rick Slayman. We have no indication that it was the result of his recent transplant,” the Boston hospital said in a statement issued late Saturday.In a world first, surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital in March successfully transplanted the genetically edited pig kidney into Slayman, who was 62 years old at the time and suffering from end-stage kidney disease.“Slayman will forever be seen as a beacon of hope to countless transplant patients worldwide and we are deeply grateful for his trust and willingness to advance the field of xenotransplantation,” the hospital statement said.Organ shortages are a chronic problem around the world and Mass General said in March that there were more than 1,400 patients on its waiting list for a kidney transplant.The pig kidney used for the transplant was provided by a Massachusetts biotech company called eGenesis and had been modified to remove harmful pig genes and add certain human genes, according to the hospital.Slayman, who suffered from Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, had received a transplanted human kidney in 2018, but it began to fail five years later.When the hospital announced the successful transplant in March, Slayman said he had agreed to the procedure “not only as a way to help (him), but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive.”In a statement posted on Mass General’s website, his family said while they were “deeply saddened about the sudden passing of our beloved Rick” they took “great comfort knowing he inspired so many.”The family said they were “comforted by the optimism he provided patients desperately waiting for a transplant”.More than 89,000 patients were on the national kidney waiting list as of March this year, according to a US health department website.On average, 17 people die each day while waiting for an organ transplant.Slayman’s family also thanked the doctors “who truly did everything they could to help give Rick a second chance. Their enormous efforts leading the xenotransplant gave our family seven more weeks with Rick, and our memories made during that time will remain in our minds and hearts.”“After his transplant, Rick said that one of the reasons he underwent this procedure was to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive,” the family added.“His legacy will be one that inspires patients, researchers, and health care professionals.”The transplantation of organs from one species to another is a growing field known as xenotransplantation.About a month after Slayman’s procedure, surgeons at NYU Langone Health in New York carried out a similar transplant on Lisa Pisano, who had suffered heart failure and end-stage kidney disease.Pig kidneys had been transplanted previously into brain-dead patients, but Slayman was the first living person to receive one.Genetically modified pig hearts were transplanted in 2023 into two patients at the University of Maryland, but both lived less than two months.Mass General said Slayman’s transplant had been carried out under a policy known as “compassionate use” that allows patients with “serious or life-threatening conditions” to access experimental therapies not yet approved by the US Food and Drug Administration."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-says-us-keeping-them-updated-on-bird-flu-outbreak/,WHO says US keeping them updated on bird flu outbreak,1,"– The WHO said Tuesday it was being frequently updated by Washington about the bird flu outbreak in the United States — the only country so far where dairy cows have been infected.Earlier this month, US authorities said a person working on a dairy farm in Texas was recovering from bird flu after having been exposed to cattle.“We have been receiving information and we have been receiving almost daily updates,” said Wenqing Zhang, head of the global influenza programme at the World Health Organization.“The response update has been updated routinely and in transparency. So we’ve got the information when it’s available and we update our risk assessment,” she told a press conference.Zhang was questioned by reporters over whether US authorities had been transparent enough over the emerging situation.She said serological studies were under way but may take time to complete, adding that genetic sequencing data had been made available, some “at a very early stage” of the US cattle outbreak.Furthermore, “the genetic sequence data of the human case was immediately available when it came out”, she added.WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier added: “The fact that this got picked up, the fact that we now know about individual cases somewhere in some farm — that shows that the surveillance system works.”Avian influenza A(H5N1) first emerged in 1996. The 2.3.4.4b clade of the virus, first detected in 2020, is behind an exponential growth in the number of outbreaks in birds.The strain has led to the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, with wild birds and land and marine mammals also infected.Cows and goats joined the list last month — a surprising development for experts because they were not thought to be susceptible to this type of influenza.US health authorities said Friday that milk sold in US stores was “safe” from bird flu because pasteurisation effectively kills the virus.The virus fragments found in pasteurised milk are not infectious, the WHO confirmed Tuesday.“Ongoing sampling suggests that raw milk from infected cows can have live virus in it, which may pose a threat, especially to farm workers,” said the UN health agency.Zhang said that as of April 24, the virus had been detected in cattle in eight US states, “but I think the figure is likely increased in the last week”, she said.She said it was not clear whether cow-to-cow transmission was taking place.“We assess the current overall public health risk posed by A(H5N1) to be low, and for those with exposure to infected birds or animals or contaminated environments, the risk of infection is considered low to moderate,” said Zhang.Human cases remain very rare, and there is no current evidence of human-to-human transmission."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/nestle-denies-double-standard-on-baby-food-in-poorer-countries/,Nestle denies ‘double standard’ on baby food in poorer countries,1,"ZURICH (AFP) – Nestle denied Thursday that it was applying any “double standard” after an NGO accused the Swiss food giant of selling baby food with high levels of added sugar in low-income countries but not in wealthier nations.“There is no double standard,” the company said in a statement. “We apply the same nutrition, health and wellness principles everywhere.”In a report published last week, Swiss NGO Public Eye said that “two of the best-selling baby-food brands marketed by Nestle in low- and middle-income countries contain high levels of added sugar, while such products are sugar free in its home country, Switzerland.”Nestle, which owns infant milk brands including Laboratoire Guigoz and Nestle Nidal, said its formula for babies under 12 months of age do not contain added sugars. It said it has been phasing out added sugars worldwide in “growing up milks” for children older than one year.“Our range of cereals for infants and young children are available with and without added sugars in many parts of the world — in Europe as well as in markets in Asia, Latin America, and North America,” the company said.“We are continuing to roll out options with no added sugar, and our ambition is to have these available everywhere we offer infant and nutrition products,” it said.In its report, Public Eye cited the Cerelac brand of flour-based cereals for six-month-olds, which it said had more than five grams of sugar per portion in Ethiopia and six grams in Thailand while it had none in Germany or Britain.Published the day before Nestle’s annual general meeting, the report added to the pressure the company was already facing from the ShareAction NGO and activist shareholders who demanded a vote on the health impact of Nestle products.The motion failed, but it forced company executives to address the issue at the AGM.Public Eye’s report also came on top of warnings by French regulators about contamination of Nestle-branded mineral waters in France.The flow of negative news “is raising concerns among shareholders,” Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Vontobel, said in a commentary.Patrik Schwendimann, an analyst at the Zurich cantonal bank, said “investor sentiment towards Nestle has not been this low in more than 25 years”."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/japan-anime-studio-draws-on-talent-of-autistic-artists/,Japan anime studio draws on talent of autistic artists,1,"KYOTO, Japan, April 26, 2024 (AFP) – Diagnosed with autism, Shoko Sakuma says she struggled working in accounting but now she is putting her childhood love of drawing to work in a special Japanese animation studio.The groundbreaking initiative aims to provide job training and confidence to people with autism who can find it hard to cope in Japan’s often high-stress and long-hours work environment.“I was really bad at numbers, which was the first thing that troubled me,” Sakuma said at Shake Hands, her workplace since last year in Kyoto in western Japan.“I would lose things… Customers’ stuff that is very important that you should never lose,” the softly-spoken 39-year-old told AFP.With attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Sakuma says she had problems concentrating on bookkeeping and eventually started developing bipolar disorder. Sometimes she couldn’t leave home.But now she spends her working days at a partitioned desk — which helps her to focus — adding digital effects to an anime keyframe.“With my personality, I cannot move onto the next step unless I thoroughly understand every detail,” she told AFP.“Instructors here accept me being like that and teach me in a very gentle manner,” she said.“I feel at ease here. I am having fun.” Developmental disabilities like ASD were long considered a mere matter of personality in Japan, but scientific studies have helped raise public awareness and change public policy.In 2004, Japan passed a law recognising conditions such as ASD, ADHD and learning disabilities, and mandated schools to detect and support children requiring special care.It also widened the remit for so-called “Type B” facilities, workplaces which previously catered only to those with conditions like Down syndrome and which now number some 16,000.Launched last year, Shake Hands does so with anime, an industry that with the likes of Ghibli studios (“Spirited Away”) is a major success story for Japan.Instructor Yuki Kawai said that obstacles in other settings can be an asset in animation.“An animation movie is constructed on what is called a time-sheet, a blueprint which commands every move of characters,” Kawai, 28, said.“There are no abstract rules in creating animations … which is easy to understand for people like us,” he told AFP. Kawai himself was diagnosed with ADHD after graduating from art and design school and the “terrible accident” of a first job in sales.“Often I couldn’t get up in the morning or couldn’t get to the office on time,” he said. “I couldn’t handle phone calls because many times I couldn’t get the person’s name right.”Such an experience for people with ASD can trigger mental health problems, said Yuji Umenaga, a Waseda University professor and specialist in mental health and learning difficulties.“Many people who visit me have shown symptoms of depression,” he told AFP, adding that some people with ASD become depressed because their symptoms make it hard“Anti-depressant medicines don’t work for them because, in the case of ASD, the trigger is its symptoms which make relationships with bosses and colleagues difficult,” he said. Shake Hands has provided animation sequences for several blockbuster films and has won an order from a Malaysian firm to produce a promotional anime movie.In the studio, upbeat music plays in the background to help make the 10 or so employees comfortable.“In a quiet environment, some people get sensitive about other people chatting, thinking they might be the subject of their talking,” said staff member Momoka Tsuji.Workers, who earn a nominal salary, are reminded to take hourly breaks and people can start and stop whenever they like, even late into the night.“Some of our colleagues don’t feel comfortable for having direct conversations, so we communicate through an intranet chat function,” said Tomoya Sawada, 34, head of the animation studio.Professor Umenaga hopes that Shake Hands will inspire other initiatives along the lines of Exceptional Minds, a US animation studio in Hollywood that provides vocational training for autistic students.“In order to help their wonderful potential shine, we need to provide the right environment for them, from childhood schooling to vocational trainings,” he said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/use-of-alcohol-and-e-cigarettes-among-youth-alarming-who/,Use of alcohol and e-cigarettes among youth ‘alarming’: WHO,1,"COPENHAGEN, April 24, 2024 (AFP) – The widespread use of alcohol and e-cigarettes among adolescents is “alarming”, according to a report released on Thursday by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) European branch, which recommended measures to limit access.Based on survey data from 280,000 young people aged 11, 13 and 15 in Europe, Central Asia and Canada, the WHO said it showed a “concerning picture” of substance use among young people.“The long-term consequences of these trends are significant, and policy-makers cannot afford to ignore these alarming findings,” the health body said.The report found that 57 percent of 15-year-olds had drunk alcohol at least once, for girls the figure was 59 percent, compared to 56 percent of boys.The WHO noted that overall drinking had decreased for boys, while it had increased for girls.When it came to current use — defined as having drunk at least once in the last 30 days — eight percent of 11-year-old boys reported having done so, compared to five percent of girls.But by age 15, girls had overtaken boys, with 38 percent of girls saying they had drunk at least once in the last 30 days, while only 36 percent of boys had.“These findings highlight how available and normalised alcohol is, showing the urgent need for better policy measures to protect children and young people from harms caused by alcohol,” said WHO Europe — which gathers 53 countries including several in Central Asia.In addition, nine percent of teenagers reported having experienced “significant drunkenness” — having been drunk at least twice.The WHO said this rate climbed from five percent among 13-year-olds to 20 percent for 15-year-olds, “demonstrating an escalating trend in alcohol abuse among youth”. The report also highlighted the increased use of e-cigarettes — often called vapes — among teenagers.While smoking is declining, with 13 percent of 11-15 year-olds having smoked in 2022, two percentage points less than four years earlier, the report noted that many of them have instead adopted e-cigarettes — which have overtaken cigarettes among adolescents.Around 32 percent of 15-year-olds have used an e-cigarette, and 20 percent reported having used one in the last 30 days.“The widespread use of harmful substances among children in many countries across the European Region — and beyond — is a serious public health threat,” WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge said in a statement.Kluge called for higher taxes, restrictions in availability and advertising, as well as a ban on flavouring agents.“Engaging in high-risk behaviours during the adolescent years can shape adult behaviour, with substance use at an early age being linked to a higher risk of addiction,” the report said.“The consequences are costly for them and society,” it added.Cannabis use, meanwhile, was down slightly with 12 percent of 15-year-olds having ever used it, down four percentage points in as many years.Conducted every four years by the WHO, the HBSC (Health Behaviour in School-aged Children) survey examines the health behaviour of 11, 13 and 15-year-olds, and includes a section on substance use.cbw/ef/jll/bc"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/a-healthy-addiction-sea-saunas-make-waves-in-ireland/,A ‘healthy addiction’: sea saunas make waves in Ireland,1,"DUNGARVAN, Ireland (AFP) – For Sharon Fidgeon, a regular visitor to Ireland’s increasingly popular beach saunas, her weekend sessions “have become a healthy addiction” that tap into a centuries-old Irish tradition of toning up by getting sweaty.On sandy Clonea beach on Ireland’s wind-battered Atlantic coast, the 52-year-old artist told AFP that alternating between the sauna and freezing seawater makes her feel “so incredibly alive”.“Once you get down in the sea up to your neck, it really sets off the endorphins in your body,” said Fidgeon after a dunk in the two-kilometre-long (1.2 mile-long) bay near Dungarvan in County Waterford.“And having the sauna here lets me stay in the sea that bit longer,” she said, putting on a dry robe and sandals before briskly stepping into the barrel-shaped structure on wheels above the beach.In Ireland the Covid-19 pandemic launched a surge in sea-swimming as a bracing escape from lockdowns.Mobile saunas became a post-Covid “add-on”, according to Deirdre Flavin, who operates several along the Waterford coast, towing them to beaches by car.“The market is growing and steadily increasing, awareness is spreading, and people are enjoying the experience and coming back for more,” she told AFP as she fired up one of her saunas.Aside from their health benefits, Flavin, 40, said the cosy boltholes are ideal havens in Ireland’s wild and often wet and chilly weather.“People can more comfortably sea-swim all-year-round now as they can warm their body cores up after the dip,” she said while packing wooden logs into the sauna’s stove. Further along the southern coast in County Cork, customers at another sauna lauded the activity for stress relief as well as aiding recovery after strenuous sports.“A lot of the lads in the hurling team would like to get into the water and the sauna, it’s become a thing to do for teams,” said 20-year-old student Rory O’Callaghan, referring to the combative Irish field sport played with sticks.Sauna owner Bronwyn Connolly suffers from arthritis and when indoor public spaces were shuttered during the pandemic she bought a small barrel sauna and towed it to Garrettstown beach.“I was struggling a lot with pain, and the sauna and the cold water just eased it, a plunge in the sea after building up a sweat just seems to wash away all the worries,” she told AFP.As sports teams and corporate groups began showing more interest she set about designing a bigger one, relying on books and YouTube videos for know-how.With a large window on one side and gently curved tiered seating with a fire, a group sat chatting and marvelling at the view of ocean waves crashing below on the beach.“It’s really becoming a social thing, where friends or even strangers can meet. Irish people are shifting to less alcohol-driven things and more wellness-driven things,” Connolly told AFP.Back in 2021 her first mobile sauna was one of the first in the country but now “they are on every beach in Cork”, she said. According to the new wave of operators, the trend harks back to an ancient Irish sauna culture dating from the 1600s that went out of fashion early in the last century: the “sweathouse”.Remains of hundreds of sweathouses — igloo-shaped stone structures heated by turf fires and used for sweating out colds and fevers, and battling rheumatism and arthritic pain — are dotted around the Irish countryside.Yoga instructor Carol Ni Stasaigh and her husband Dara Kissane, an exercise physiologist, called their sea sauna on the County Wexford coast “Sweathouse” in a nod to the old ways.“In ancient times people would have gone in for medicinal, religious purposes, or even hallucinogenic reasons,” Ni Stasaigh told AFP on Baginbun beach.“We don’t guarantee any hallucinogenic things in our sauna, just hot and cold therapy and the release of endorphins,” she laughed.Back in Waterford, towelling down at the end of her session, Sharon Fidgeon told AFP the link to the past was an important element of her sauna bathing experience.“It’s an old Irish tradition. It’s really lovely to be part of something that is old and Irish. It’s magical and quite close to my heart,” she said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/h5n1-strain-of-bird-flu-found-in-milk-who/,H5N1 strain of bird flu found in milk: WHO,1,"– The H5N1 bird flu virus strain has been detected in very high concentrations in raw milk from infected animals, the WHO said Friday, though how long the virus can survive in milk is unknown.Avian influenza A(H5N1) first emerged in 1996 but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, alongside an increase in the number of infected mammals.The strain has led to the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, with wild birds and land and marine mammals also infected.Cows and goats joined the list last month — a surprising development for experts because they were not thought to be susceptible to this type of influenza.US authorities earlier this month said a person working on a dairy farm in Texas was recovering from bird flu after being exposed to cattle.“The case in Texas is the first case of a human infected by avian influenza by a cow,” said Wenqing Zhang, head of the global influenza programme at the World Health Organization.“Bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow and cow-to-bird transmission have also been registered during these current outbreaks, which suggest that the virus may have found other routes of transition than we previously understood,” she told a media briefing in Geneva.It was only the second case of a human testing positive for bird flu in the United States, and came after the virus sickened herds that were apparently exposed to wild birds.“Now we see multiple herds of cows affected in an increasing number of US states, which shows a further step of the virus spillover to mammals,” Zhang said.“The virus has also been detected in milk from infected animals.”Zhang said there was a “very high virus concentration in raw milk”, but experts were still investigating exactly how long the virus is able to survive in milk.The Texas health department has said the cattle infections do not present a concern for the commercial milk supply, as dairies are required to destroy milk from sick cows. Pasteurisation also kills the virus.“It is important for people to ensure safe food practices, including consuming only pasteurised milk and milk products,” said Zhang.From 2003 to April 1 this year, the WHO said it had recorded 463 deaths from 889 human cases across 23 countries, putting the case fatality rate at 52 percent.Zhang noted that the human cases recorded in Europe and the United States in the past few years — since the virus surged — have been mild cases.So far, there is no evidence that A(H5N1) is spreading between humans.And Zhang stressed that the A(H5N1) viruses identified in cows and in the human case in Texas showed no increased adaptation to mammals.As for potential vaccines, if required, Zhang said there were some in the pipeline.“Having candidate vaccine viruses ready allows us to be prepared to quickly produce vaccines for humans, if this becomes necessary,” she said.“For this particular H5N1 virus detected in dairy cows, there are a couple of candidate vaccine viruses available.”In the case of a pandemic, there are close to 20 influenza vaccines licensed for pandemic use and they could be tailored with the specific virus strain in circulation, she said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/japan-doctors-sue-google-maps-over-punching-bag-reviews/,Japan doctors sue Google Maps over ‘punching bag’ reviews,1,"TOKYO, April 19, 2024 (AFP) – Around 60 doctors in Japan have accused Google Maps of ignoring vitriolic reviews of their clinics in a class-action lawsuit touted as the first of its kind.The medics are seeking 1.4 million yen ($9,000) in total damages from Google in a bid to hold the US tech titan accountable for inaction over the reviews.They sued the company on Thursday, saying they are powerless to reply to, or refute, reputation-damaging reviews because of their obligation to patient confidentiality.“People who post online can say anything anonymously, even if it’s nothing but slander or verbal abuse”, one of the participating doctors told reporters.“It’s like I’m a punching bag”, he said under anonymity.The case at Tokyo District Court is believed to be the first class-action lawsuit in Japan to target a platform over negative online reviews, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said.“Despite the ease with which they are posted, it has become extremely difficult to get the reviews taken down,” lawyer Yuichi Nakazawa told AFP.“This can lead to doctors doing their job under the constant fear of receiving horrible reviews”, he said.The objective of many medical institutions is not to satisfy patients, but to deal with their illnesses from a professional standpoint, the plaintiffs’ complaint said.“Clinics that give patients only a perfunctory diagnosis and prescribe medicines as requested would be inappropriate medically, but highly appreciated by patients,” it said.The nature of the job can also sometimes leave doctors susceptible to ad hominem online attacks by patients holding a grudge, plaintiffs argued.If the situation remains unaddressed, doctors “may find themselves hesitant to be firm and refuse medically unnecessary examinations or medicines requested by patients,” Nakazawa warned.That ultimately does society a disservice, he argued.Google Maps is so widely used in Japan that it serves as “infrastructure” for daily life, according to the complaint.So Google should be able to “easily recognise” the disadvantages to medical businesses if unfair reviews are left unaddressed, it said.The plaintiffs acknowledged that Google takes down some Maps reviews under its own guidelines, but criteria for removal is opaque and “few” are deleted, they alleged.Google told AFP it is “making efforts to reduce inaccurate and misleading content on Google Maps”.“With the combination of human operators and computers, we are protecting the profile of companies around the clock, and removing unjust reviews”, the company said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/human-cases-of-bird-flu-an-enormous-concern-who/,Human cases of bird flu ‘an enormous concern’: WHO,1,"The World Health Organization voiced alarm Thursday at the growing spread of H5N1 bird flu to new species, including humans, who face an “extraordinarily high” mortality rate.“This remains I think an enormous concern,” the UN health agency’s chief scientist Jeremy Farrar told reporters in Geneva.The current bird flu outbreak began in 2020 and has led to the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, with wild birds also infected as well as land and marine mammals.Cows and goats joined the list last month — a surprising development for experts because they were not thought susceptible to this type of influenza.The A (H5N1) strain has become “a global zoonotic animal pandemic”, Farrar said.“The great concern of course is that in… infecting ducks and chickens and then increasingly mammals, that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans and then critically the ability to go from human to human.”So far, there is no evidence that the influenza A(H5N1) virus is spreading between humans.But in the hundreds of cases where humans have been infected through contact with animals, “the mortality rate is extraordinarily high”, Farrar said.From 2003 to April 1 this year, the WHO said it had recorded 463 deaths from 889 human cases across 23 countries, putting the case fatality rate at 52 percent.In a worrying development, US authorities earlier this month said a person in Texas was recovering from bird flu after being exposed to dairy cattle.It was only the second case of a human testing positive for bird flu in the country, and came after the virus sickened herds that were apparently exposed to wild birds in Texas, Kansas and other states.It also appears to have been the first human infection with the influenza A(H5N1) virus strain through contact with an infected mammal, WHO said.When “you come into the mammalian population, then you’re getting closer to humans,” Farrar said, warning that “this virus is just looking for new, novel hosts”.“It’s a real concern.”Farrar called for beefing up monitoring, insisting it was “very important understanding how many human infections are happening… because that’s where adaptation (of the virus) will happen”.“It’s a tragic thing to say, but if I get infected with H5N1 and I die, that’s the end of it. If I go around the community and I spread it to somebody else then you start the cycle.”He said efforts were under way towards the development of vaccines and therapeutics for H5N1, and stressed the need to ensure that regional and national health authorities around the world have the capacity to diagnose the virus.This was being done so that “if H5N1 did come across to humans, with human-to-human transmission”, the world would be “in a position to immediately respond”, Farrar said, urging equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/womens-bodies-being-turned-into-battlegrounds-un/,Women’s bodies being turned into ‘battlegrounds’: UN,1,"GENEVA, April 17, 2024 (AFP) – Women’s bodies have become political “battlegrounds”, putting at risk 30 years of progress on sexual and reproductive health for women and girls, the UN warned Wednesday.Though maternal mortality rates and unwanted pregnancy rates have been steadily falling, progress is now slowing or even flatlining on key measures, said the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN’s sexual and reproductive health agency.Thirty years ago, at a conference in Cairo, 179 countries agreed to put reproductive health at the heart of sustainable development, which “paved the way for decades of progress”, said UNFPA chief Natalia Kanem — who herself attended the conference.Since then, the rate of unintended pregnancies has fallen by almost 20 percent worldwide and the number of maternal deaths decreased by 34 percent between 2000 and 2020, UNFPA said in its flagship annual State of World Population report, which has been published yearly since 1978.The number of women using contraceptives has doubled, and at least 162 countries have passed laws against domestic violence.However, “the rights of women, girls and gender-diverse people are the subject of increasing pushback”, Kanem told a press conference.“Annual reductions in maternal deaths have flatlined. Since 2016 the world made zero progress in saving women from preventable deaths in pregnancy and childbirth,” she stressed. UNFPA said racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination were also blocking broad gains in sexual and reproductive health for women and girls.“The data are damning. Women and girls who are poor, belong to ethnic, racial and indigenous minority groups, or are trapped in conflict settings, are more likely to die because they lack access to timely health care,” the agency said.Kanem also hit out at “the willingness to politicise women’s bodies as a battleground”, for example on questions linked to fertility treatments and to abortion, which is one of the key issues in the US presidential election campaign this year.UNFPA does not take a position on individual member states’ policies, but Kanem said that where legal, abortion should be safe and accessible, and where illegal, post-abortion services — typically relating to haemorrhage — should be made available.Unsafe abortion is a leading cause of maternal death globally, but “often the physician is not going to put unsafe abortion on the death certificate”, she said.“The lives and well-being of women and girls should not really be subject to political pressures,” Kanem insisted. Kanem said gender-based violence remains rampant in practically every country, while “one woman in four cannot say no to sex”.Almost half of all women are still unable to make decisions about their own bodies, nor to exercise their rights regarding sexual and reproductive health.Last month, legislators in The Gambia began considering reversing the 2015 ban on female genital mutilation.Kanem noted this came at a time when there are “over 230 million survivors of FGM — and there’s been a 15-percent increase in that number since 2016”.The report said that although women of all socio-economic classes and ethnicities report easier access to health care over time, the most marginalised women have seen the least improvement.Across the Americas, women of African descent are more likely to die when giving birth than white women. In the United States, the rate is three times higher than the national average, the agency said.Women with disabilities are up to 10 times more likely to experience gender-based violence than their peers without disabilities.An African woman who experiences pregnancy and childbirth complications is around 130 times more likely to die from them than a woman in Europe and North America, UNFPA said.On maternal mortality, Kanem concluded: “Women should not die while giving life.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/asia-pacific-gets-new-weapon-in-fight-against-drug-resistant-tb/,Asia-Pacific gets new weapon in fight against drug-resistant TB,1,"MANILA, April 12, 2024 (AFP) – A faster and vastly more effective treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis is being rolled out in the Asia-Pacific region, raising hopes of a “new era” in tackling one of the world’s deadliest infectious diseases.The region had most of the world’s estimated 10.6 million new TB cases in 2022, and more than half of the 1.3 million deaths, World Health Organization (WHO) figures show.While TB can be successfully treated with antibiotics, more than three percent of new TB patients are resistant to commonly prescribed drugs.Until recently, treatment for these patients involved daily painful injections or a fistful of pills for 18 months or longer, while some endured severe side effects such as nausea and, in extreme cases, blindness.Many people prematurely quit their treatment, which had a success rate of 63 percent or lower.Now, a new drug regimen involving fewer pills and side effects is being rolled out in the Asia-Pacific, including the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia, where trials have shown a more than 90 percent cure rate after six months.The treatment, known as BPaL, combines the antibiotics bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid, and has received regulatory approval in more than 60 countries since 2019, according to the non-profit TB Alliance, which developed it.The WHO updated its guidelines in 2022 to allow BPaL to be used with or without a fourth antibiotic called moxifloxacin.BPaL has been life-changing for Filipino cook Efifanio Brillante, who was diagnosed with drug-resistant TB in June 2022 and initially went on an older form of treatment.Brillante, 57, was swallowing 20 tablets a day, but it left him feeling so nauseous that he couldn’t work or eat.He stopped the medication after two weeks even though he knew the decision could be fatal.“It’s very difficult. You’re always in bed,” Brillante told AFP about his experience of having TB.“Sometimes I couldn’t even breathe.”The following month, Brillante joined a BPaL trial at the Jose B Lingad Memorial General Hospital in Pampanga province, north of the Philippine capital Manila.He took between three and seven pills a day and was cured after six months.“I’m very thankful that I was healed,” Brillante told AFP in his home.“If I didn’t take that BPaL, I might already be buried in the cemetery.” TB, once called consumption, is caused by a bacteria that primarily attacks the lungs and is transmitted through the air by infected people, for example by coughing.While it is found in every country, poorer people living and working in overcrowded conditions are at higher risk of the disease.Eight countries accounted for two-thirds of new TB cases in 2022: India, Indonesia, China, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and the Democratic Republic of Congo.One of the biggest challenges of treating drug-resistant TB has been getting patients to take the full course of their medication.Even in countries where treatment is free, patients face crippling travel costs to hospitals and loss of income, or even their job, due to the illness and side-effects of the drugs, leading many to stop taking their pills.In Vietnam, most people diagnosed with TB are from low-income families, Hoang Thi Thanh Thuy from the Vietnam National Tuberculosis Program told AFP.Nearly everyone with drug-resistant TB endured “catastrophic” expenses over the period of their treatment, she said.“All of these difficulties can affect patient compliance and lead to poor treatment and increasing drug resistance,” Thuy said.Identifying people with TB is also a challenge.In Indonesia, some healthcare facilities are still not able to properly diagnose the disease, said Imran Pambudi of the health ministry.Fear of social stigma from a positive diagnosis is also common.“We’re trying to educate them that TB is a curable disease,” said Irene Flores, who led the BPaL trial at the Jose B Lingad Memorial General Hospital in the Philippines.“If they come early, we can prevent complications.” After years of decline, the number of people falling ill with TB and drug-resistant tuberculosis began increasing during the Covid-19 pandemic, which disrupted diagnosis and treatment, the WHO said previously.After gargantuan global efforts to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus, the WHO has called for increased funding to fight TB.“As TB stopped being a high income-country problem, motivation to invest in research and development for new TB drugs dried up,” said Sandeep Juneja, senior vice president of market access at the TB Alliance.To help accelerate the rollout of BPaL, with or without moxifloxacin, the TB Alliance has set up a “knowledge hub” in Manila to provide training and assistance to other countries.In India, where BPaL has been approved, there is growing impatience for it to be introduced into health clinics given the country’s world-beating caseload.“BPaL should be rolled out soon because it will spare patients a lot of headaches and provide psychological relief too, besides reducing cost of treatment in the long run,” said Ravikant Singh, founder of advocacy group Doctors For You.Juneja said the new regimen meant treating drug-resistant TB was no longer a guessing game of whether a patient would survive or not.But more is needed to be done, he added.“I hope this is… just the beginning of a new era of TB treatment where they will be even simpler, even shorter.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/diabetes-drug-shows-promise-against-parkinsons-in-clinical-study/,Diabetes drug shows promise against Parkinson’s in clinical study,1,"WASHINGTON, April 4, 2024 (AFP) – A drug used to treat diabetes slowed the progression of motor issues associated with Parkinson’s disease, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine said Wednesday.Parkinson’s is a devastating nervous system disorder affecting 10 million people worldwide, with no current cure. Symptoms include rhythmic shaking known as tremors, slowed movement, impaired speech and problems balancing, which get worse over time.Researchers have been interested in exploring a class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists — which mimic a gut hormone and are commonly used to treat diabetes and obesity — for their potential to protect neurons.So far however, evidence of clinical benefits in patients has been limited and early studies have proved inconclusive.In the new paper, 156 patients with early-stage Parkinson’s were recruited across France and then randomly chosen to receive either lixisenatide, which is sold under the brand names Adlyxin and Lyxumia and made by Sanofi, or a placebo.After one year of follow up, the group on the treatment, which is given as an injection, saw no worsening of their movement symptoms, while those on the placebo did.The effect was “modest” according to the paper, and was noticeable only when assessed by professionals “who made them do tasks; walking, standing up, moving their hands, etc” senior author Olivier Rascol, a neurologist at Toulouse University, told AFP.But, he added, this may just be because Parkinson’s disease worsens slowly, and with another year of follow up, the differences might become much starker.“This is the first time that we have clear results, which demonstrate that we had an impact on the progression of the symptoms of the disease and that we explain it by a neuroprotective effect,” said Rascol. Gastrointestinal side effects were common on the drug and included nausea, vomiting and reflux, while a handful of patients experienced weight loss.Both Rasol and co-author Wassilios Meissner, a neurologist at Bordeaux University Hospital, both stressed more study would be required to confirm safety and efficacy before the treatment should be given to patients.Michael Okun, medical director of the Parkinson’s Foundation, told AFP that from a practical standpoint, the differences in patient outcomes were not clinically significant, but “statistically and compared to other studies, this type of difference should draw our interest and attention.”“Experts will likely argue whether this study meets a minimum threshold for neuroprotection, and it likely does not,” continued Okun, adding the weight loss side effect was concerning for Parkinson’s patients.Rodolfo Savica, a professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota added: “The data so far are suggestive of a possible effect — but we need to replicate the study for sure.”He added that, while this study lumped together patients aged 40-75, separating them by age group might have revealed ages at which the treatment is more effective.The authors of the new study said they were looking forward to the results from other forthcoming trials that may help confirm their findings."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/how-period-tracking-could-boost-performance-of-female-olympians/,How period tracking could boost performance of female Olympians,1,"PARIS, April 1, 2024 (AFP) – French swimmer Caroline Jouisse has been keeping track of her periods using her phone over the last year, collecting information for her coaches ahead of competing in the Paris Olympics this summer.The data helps her plan the best time to work on building her muscles, which is ideally in the middle and at the end of her menstrual cycle when her testosterone levels are at their highest.“It’s important to know when my testosterone peaks are, because that is when you feel your best and will be at your strongest in training,” said the 29-year-old, who will compete in the 10-kilometre open water event at the Paris Games.Research in sport focuses overwhelmingly on male athletes, and the effect menstrual cycles have on athletic performance remains under-studied.Hoping to address this gap, France’s National Institute of Sport (INSEP) launched a program called Empow’her in 2020 to track and learn from the menstrual cycles of athletes.“There is no need to be embarrassed about your cycle — it is part of performance, just like nutrition or training,” said INSEP gynecologist Carole Maitre. For six months last year, Jouisse’s training sessions were analysed daily. Her hormonal, cardiac and psychological data was then compared to the different stages of her menstrual cycle.“Before starting the program, I was not aware that there were all these phases,” said Jouisse, who is currently doing 10 swimming and three weight training sessions every week.French cross-country skier Juliette Ducordeau said the Empow’her program helped her understand her body better, as well as identify “quite impressive trends” in her performance.“The optimal times for my training sessions are during the ovulation phase, from the first to the 15th day of the cycle,” the 25-year-old said.The last few days were more laborious, she added.Since launching in 2020, 130 French sportswomen have participated in Empow’her, which hopes to help fill in significant gaps in scientific research about the female body.The head of the program, Juliana Antero, said that just nine percent of sports science studies published in the last five years were about women — compared to 71 percent for men.“There are very few high-quality studies, so for the moment there is no consensus on the impact menstrual cycles have on sports performance,” Antero said.While the symptoms — such as headaches and pain — were relatively similar, how intense they were and how long they lasted can vary significantly between different athletes, she said.A 2021 UK study conducted on elite female footballers found that around 90 percent suffered from fatigue and loss of power during menstruation.Two thirds said their confidence and focus were affected, while 13 percent missed training or matches, according to the study led by researchers at Queen Mary University of London.Period tracking hit the headlines in 2019, when the United States women’s football team credited it with helping players train for their victorious World Cup campaign. But change has been slow.Alpine skier Clara Direz, a former Empow’her participant, said that her mostly male coaches are still “embarrassed to talk about menstrual cycles — and don’t show much interest”.“It is important to raise awareness among athletes — but first and most importantly we need to raise awareness among coaches,” Jouisse, the swimmer, said.Talking about periods remains “taboo” in her sport, she added.But ahead of the Paris Olympics starting in July, more attention is turning towards the subject.France’s cycling federation recently took part in a study which demonstrated that cyclists perform better on average in the middle of their menstrual cycle.“Before there was discomfort, and athletes had to ask for help,” Maitre said.“Now, we’re working on them getting systematic support.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/japan-dietary-supplement-maker-probes-five-deaths/,Japan dietary supplement maker probes five deaths,1,"– A Japanese drugmaker said on Friday it is investigating five deaths potentially linked to dietary supplements meant to lower cholesterol and apologised for the “anxiety and fear” it had caused.Kobayashi Pharmaceutical has recalled three brands of over-the-counter tablets after customers reported kidney problems.The firm said it was trying to establish if the products containing red yeast rice, or “beni koji”, had caused five deaths and 114 hospitalisations.Medical studies say red yeast rice can lower cholesterol but also warn of a risk of organ damage depending on the ingredient’s chemical make-up.The growing crisis has made headlines in Japan, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida pledging to consider “all possible measures” to prevent similar incidents if the deaths were caused by the products.“I apologise deeply for the great anxiety and fear we have caused,” company president Akihiro Kobayashi told a news conference on Friday.He said the company would “devote all our energies” to investigating the matter.Kobayashi Pharmaceutical, which voluntarily recalled “Beni Koji Choleste Help” and two other tablet brands a week ago, supplies red yeast rice to around 50 other firms in Japan and two in Taiwan.Some of those companies have preventively recalled food products containing the ingredient, including a rose-coloured sake and salad dressing.Kobayashi Pharmaceutical said in a statement earlier Friday it had been informed of the death of a fifth customer who had been taking Beni Koji Choleste Help and developed a kidney condition.“We are in the process of confirming the facts and causal relationship,” the statement said.Taiwanese companies have preventively recalled 154 products containing red yeast rice in the wake of the scare, the island’s health authorities said.A woman in her 70s in Taiwan has also reportedly developed kidney failure after taking Kobayashi’s supplements for several years.Kobayashi officials acknowledged that the recalled supplements contained puberulic acid, derived from blue mould, after the health ministry said the substance might have been in the red yeast rice products.But the company said the acid has not been confirmed as the cause of the illnesses, since its toxicity has not yet been examined.Kobayashi’s red yeast rice supplements are regulated under a system created in 2015 under former premier Shinzo Abe.Some watchdogs have reportedly expressed concerns that the regulation of these products is not sufficiently stringent and that they do not always have the advertised effects.Top government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi on Friday instructed ministers to review the regulatory system and compile a report by the end of May, local media reported."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/nations-fail-to-reach-pandemic-accord-talks-to-resume-april/,Nations fail to reach pandemic accord: talks to resume April,1,"By Robin MILLARD – Two years of talks aimed at striking a landmark global agreement on handling future pandemics failed to seal a deal in time on Thursday, and will restart next month for one final push.Scarred by Covid-19, which shredded economies, overturned societies, crippled health systems and killed millions, countries are trying to craft an international accord on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.But while they largely agree on the principles of what should be done when the next pandemic strikes, nations are still at odds over how far they are prepared to go to turn those notions into binding commitments.The ninth and supposedly final two-week round of talks therefore ended Thursday without finding a breakthrough.“You are not far away from concluding a deal,” World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told countries as the talks petered out at the WHO headquarters in Geneva.“I always keep hope alive and I am hopeful that you will.“The treaty is a life-saving instrument, not merely a piece of paper,” he added.“It holds the power to transform our collective response to future pandemics, to protect lives and to safeguard the wellbeing of communities.”He urged nations to work towards getting a final agreement by the end of May. Mindful that a pandemic could hit at any time, the plan was to finalise an agreement at these talks, so it could be approved by the WHO’s 194 member states at their annual assembly, which starts on May 27.Instead, fresh talks will run from April 29 to May 10.The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body bureau conducting the talks will draw up a new draft text no later than April 18 and work to finalise talks by May 5.The current draft has ballooned from 30 pages to nearly 100, with suggested amendments. Some participants want the INB to cut it down to 20 pages.“It’s just too long,” said one Western diplomat.“It’s too detailed and too broad. Agreeing on 30 pages with such a level of uncertainty in such a short time is impossible.”Campaign groups have warned that the pressure to reach an agreement could lead to a watered-down text which does little to make the world safer than it was before the Covid-19 pandemic.K. M. Gopakumar, senior researcher with the Third World Network NGO, told AFP the new text would likely be a lighter document, which could be added to at a later stage.“They have climbed down from a full-fledged treaty to a much more concise document,” he said at the WHO HQ.“It’s a face-saving exercise as of now, because they are so desperate to finish everything by May.” The main issues of contention include shared access to emerging pathogens, better prevention and monitoring of disease outbreaks, reliable financing and transferring pandemic-fighting technology to poorer countries.Ultimately, the talks have come to the crunch over the balance between richer and poorer nations.Wealthier states want immediate information-sharing on new and emerging pathogens with pandemic potential, as well as strict — and expensive — preparedness obligations for all countries.In return, developing countries want water-tight language on technology transfer and equitable access to vaccines, tests and treatments."

The highest levels of cyberbullying were experienced by boys in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Moldova and Poland, while the lowest levels were reported in Spain, the WHO said without providing detailed data.“With young people spending up to six hours online every single day, even small changes in the rates of bullying and violence can have profound implications for the health and well-being of thousands,” Kluge said.One adolescent in eight admitted cyberbullying others, an increase of three percentage points from 2018, the report said.The number of adolescents who engaged in physical fighting meanwhile remained stable over the four-year period at 10 percent — 14 percent for boys and six percent for girls.The study was based on data from 279,000 children and adolescents from 44 countries across Europe, Central Asia and Canada.In most places, cyberbullying peaked when children were 11 years old for boys and 13 for girls.Parents’ socioeconomic status made little difference in children’s behaviour, the report found.Canada was however an exception, where less advantaged youths were more likely to experience bullying.There, 27 percent of girls belonging to the 20 percent least affluent families said they had been subjected to bullying at school, compared to 21 percent of girls among the 20 percent most affluent families.Noting that the problem was widespread, the report called for greater efforts to improve awareness.“More investment in the monitoring of different forms of peer violence is needed,” it said.“There is also an urgent need to educate young people, families and schools of the forms of cyberbullying and its implications, while regulating social media platforms to limit exposures to cyberbullying,” it concluded.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-surgeons-transplant-pig-kidney-to-live-patient-in-world-first/,US surgeons transplant pig kidney to live patient in world first,1,"By Chris LefkowWASHINGTON, March 21, 2024 (AFP) – US surgeons have successfully transplanted a genetically modified pig kidney into a living patient for the first time, the hospital said Thursday, a procedure that could help address the chronic shortage of donor organs.The four-hour operation was carried out on Saturday on a 62-year-old man suffering from end-stage kidney disease, Massachusetts General Hospital said.“The procedure marks a major milestone in the quest to provide more readily available organs to patients,” the hospital known as Mass General, or MGH, said in a statement.Organ shortages are a chronic problem around the world and the Boston hospital said there are more than 1,400 patients on the waiting list for a kidney transplant at MGH alone.“Our hope is that this transplant approach will offer a lifeline to millions of patients worldwide who are suffering from kidney failure,” said Dr Tatsuo Kawai, a member of the team which carried out the ground-breaking operation.The hospital said the pig kidney used for the transplant was provided by a Massachusetts biotech company called eGenesis and had been genetically-edited to remove harmful pig genes and add certain human genes.“This represents a new frontier in medicine and demonstrates the potential of genome engineering to change the lives of millions of patients globally suffering from kidney failure,” said Mike Curtis, the chief executive officer of eGenesis.The hospital said the patient, Richard Slayman of Weymouth, Massachusetts, “is recovering well at MGH and is expected to be discharged soon.”He will be on a regimen of immunosuppressive drugs to ward off rejection of the pig kidney.Slayman, who suffers from Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, had received a transplant of a human kidney in 2018, but it began to fail five years later and he has been on dialysis.Slayman said he agreed to the pig kidney transplant as “not only as a way to help me, but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive.”Slayman is Black and the hospital said the procedure could be of particular benefit to ethnic minorities who suffer from high rates of kidney disease.“This health disparity has been the target of many national policy initiatives for over 30 years, with only limited success,” said Slayman’s nephrologist Winfred Williams.“An abundant supply of organs resulting from this technological advance may go far to finally achieve health equity and offer the best solution to kidney failure — a well-functioning kidney — to all patients in need,” Williams said.The transplantation of organs from one species to another is a growing field known as xenotransplantation.Pig kidneys had been transplanted previously into brain dead patients, but Slayman is the first living person to receive one.Genetically modified pig hearts were transplanted recently into two patients at the University of Maryland, but both survived less than two months.Mass General said the pigs used as organ donors were “grown in isolation under special conditions to prevent the pig from being exposed to infections that might harm the human recipient.”“These special pigs have organs of similar size and function to human organs,” it said. “The genetic modifications of these pigs have also made them more compatible with humans.”Mass General said the transplant was carried out under a policy known as “compassionate use” that allows patients with “serious or life-threatening conditions” to access experimental therapies not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration."

It’s so cool,” said Arbaugh, who joked of having telepathy thanks to Elon Musk’s Neuralink startup.Musk’s neurotechnology company installed a brain implant in its first human test subject in January, with the billionaire head of Tesla and X touting it as a success.Arbaugh said he was released from the hospital a day after the device was implanted in his brain, and that he had no cognitive impairment as a result.“There is a lot of work to be done, but it has already changed my life,” he said.“I don’t want people to think this is the end of the journey.”He told of starting out by thinking about moving the cursor and eventually the implant system mirrored his intent.“The reason I got into it was because I wanted to be part of something that I feel is going to change the world,” he said.Arbaugh said he plans to dress up this Halloween as Marvel Comics X-Men character Charles Xavier, who is wheelchair-bound but possesses mental superpowers.“I’m going to be Professor X,” he said.“I think that’s pretty fitting… I’m basically telekinetic.”A Neuralink engineer in the video, which was posted on X and Reddit, promised more updates regarding the patient’s progress.“I knew they started doing this with human patients, but it’s another level to actually see the person who has one in,” one Reddit user commented.“Really crazy, impressive and scary all at once.”Neuralink’s technology works through a device about the size of five stacked coins that is placed inside the human brain through invasive surgery.The startup, cofounded by Musk in 2016, aims to build direct communication channels between the brain and computers.The ambition is to supercharge human capabilities, treat neurological disorders like ALS or Parkinson’s, and maybe one day achieve a symbiotic relationship between humans and artificial intelligence.Musk is hardly alone in trying to make advances in the field, which is officially known as brain-machine or brain-computer interface research.gc/bfm"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/the-search-to-discover-why-outliers-survive-deadliest-cancers/,The search to discover why ‘outliers’ survive deadliest cancers,1,"When Herve found out he had glioblastoma — the most aggressive form of brain cancer — at the age of 40, he made a deal with himself.“I said to myself: it is serious, but you are at war — and you’re going to win,” the French teacher, who did not want to give his surname, told AFP.“For my wife and children, I forbade myself to die.”Eight years later, following surgery to remove the tumour, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, Herve is still winning his war.He is just one of the thousands of people across the world to have survived an extremely deadly cancer for which there is no known cure.Herve eagerly volunteered for research being conducted by a biotech start-up aiming to find out what makes these exceptional cases different, in the hope of reproducing their unlikely tales of survival on a grand scale.“We call them outliers,” said Nicolas Wolikow, the CEO and co-founder of the Paris-based firm Cure51.“For unknown reasons, when these people face an illness they take a completely different trajectory from other people,” he told AFP.The start-up is working on creating “the first global clinical and molecular database of exceptional survivors” of cancer, according to its website.The project will involve patients who lived for more than three or five years after being diagnosed with three of the deadliest cancers: glioblastoma, metastatic pancreatic cancer and small cell lung cancer.“They are very aggressive cancers for which real new treatments have not been developed over the last 15 years,” Wolikow said.Yet the rare few — tens of thousands of people worldwide — still defy what for most would be a death sentence. The question is why. One problem has been that almost all research has been based on North American or Western European patients, Wolikow said.So the firm has partnered with 50 cancer centres around the world to get data from a wider variety of survivors.So far, the firm has found 1,300 patients to be part of the project.Once the data is collected “we will begin analysing medical reports, images, tumour cells,” Wolikow said.The patients will also fill out questionnaires about their lifestyle, sleep, diet and the roles of people around them.Algorithms deploying artificial intelligence will also be used to seek out the patients’ common traits, comparing them to those of people who succumbed to their cancer.On Wednesday, Cure51 announced it has raised 15 million euros ($16 million) for the project. Eventually, it hopes to be financed through collaborations with other biotech firms or pharmaceutical labs.Olivia Le Saux, an oncologist in the French city of Lyon who is supervising the project, said the team was hoping to discover a “molecular signature which would explain the exceptional survival of these patients”.The ultimate goal is to create new drugs or treatments that mimic the molecular characteristics of those few who do survive these killer cancers.For Herve, there was some satisfaction in seeing the surprise on the face of his doctor when his tumour kept failing to return in his regular MRI scans.“At each appointment I could see the relief on his face,” said the teacher in southeastern French department of Isere.So Herve has happy to volunteer for the Cure51 project.“I am well aware of having extraordinary luck,” he said.“I told myself that if I wanted to make a contribution, now was the time.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/how-genetic-therapies-transformed-the-lives-of-sickle-cell-patients/,How genetic therapies transformed the lives of sickle cell patients,1,"WASHINGTON, March 18, 2024 (AFP) – Their stories are divided into before and after.First, those long years of pain which flooded every moment — school, relationships, work.And then — after agonizing treatments — what felt like the miracle of life after sickle cell disease (SCD).Two Americans whose lives were turned around by newly approved treatments tell AFP they want others to benefit too.But the eye-watering cost — up to $3.1 million per course of treatment — could limit access for other patients.– ‘Like coming to life’ – Tesha Samuels was born in 1982 — just before the invention of prenatal screening for SCD, an inherited red blood cell disorder.SCD affects around 100,000 people in the United States and some 20 million worldwide.Most people with the condition are Black. Scientists say this is because the sickle cell trait evolved to protect people exposed to malaria, so the risk of SCD is higher.Those with the disease have abnormal hemoglobin — the molecule that carries oxygen — making their red cells hard and C-shaped like sickles.Complications include anemia, bouts of extreme pain, organ damage and early death.Tesha was diagnosed aged two and recalls a childhood in and out of hospital.At seven, she suffered a life-threatening case of anemia and then aged 13 she had a stroke which led to monthly blood infusions.Tesha said “the stigma of a Black child going to the hospital saying they’re in pain” made her wait until things got unbearable.As a young adult, Tesha saw the disease take the life of a dear friend named Mohammed, a fellow “sickle cell warrior” who would often end up in the same hospital as her.She began studying at the prestigious Howard University hoping to become a doctor but her health forced her to drop out. She then tried community college but, once more, SCD meant couldn’t finish.“You downgrade your dreams based on your capacity in sickle cell,” said Tesha.As a newlywed in her twenties, she was dismayed at needing an intravenous medicine drip for eight hours every night to manage her condition.But in 2018 her life turned a corner when she became one of the first ever people to receive an experimental gene therapy.The procedure — now marketed as Lyfgenia — uses a modified virus to deliver a functional version of the hemoglobin-producing gene. .First, doctors draw out stem cells from the bone marrow before modifying them in a lab. Then comes the hardest part — chemotherapy to clear the way for the return of the treated cells.In addition to losing all her hair, chemotherapy saw Tesha have a 16-hour nosebleed which left her in intensive care.Her recovery was further complicated as her blood platelets, which are essential for blood clotting, took months to bounce back.But when they did, her energy levels soared.“It’s almost like coming to life,” Tesha said. “Here’s this new life ahead of you. What do I want to do with it?”Tesha went back to school to complete her degree.She also started her own advocacy group, Journey to ExSCellence, to spread word of the treatment among the Black community.“It looks like the cure, but we like to call this ‘transformative,'” said physician-scientist John Tisdale of the National Institutes of Health, which ran the trial Tesha took part in.Tisdale emphasized that each patient needed monitoring for 15 years to complete the study. Jimi Olaghere’s first memory of sickle cell goes back to when he was eight-years-old, playing soccer with other kids in his native Nigeria and needing to stop every five minutes for rest and water.“I asked my mom, why am I different?” he remembers.His parents sent him to live with his aunt in New Jersey where there was better health care but his childhood remained a struggle.Jimi, 38, was unable to complete college and found his disease was too heavy a burden to place on most romantic partners, until he found his wife who was willing to embrace the challenge.The disease also took a terrible toll.His gallbladder was removed, he had a heart attack and lung clots. At his worst, he recalls spending 80 percent of his time in bed.Moving to the warmer climate of Atlanta brought some relief, as it does for many with SCD.Then, in 2019, he heard about a CRISPR gene therapy clinical trial. He applied to be tested for eligibility and received a “magical” voicemail telling him he was in.Thanks to the CRISPR-modified stem cell therapy he received, now marketed as Casgevy, Jimi is “basically living the dream now.”He has three children, thanks to IVF, and runs several small businesses.Like Tesha, Jimi has raised his voice to advocate for others, particularly in Africa, where access to such treatment seems a far-off dream.Tisdale, of the NIH, said the next step was reducing the physical burden of the treatment and making it cheaper.It remains unclear how much private insurers will pay to offset the procedure’s enormous costs.But Medicaid, a US government-backed insurance program, has said it will pay for the therapies starting next year."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/surging-nervous-system-disorders-now-top-cause-of-illness-study/,Surging nervous system disorders now top cause of illness: study,1,"Conditions affecting the nervous system — such as strokes, migraines and dementia — have surged past heart disease to become the leading cause of ill health worldwide, a major new analysis said on Friday.More than 3.4 billion people — 43 percent of the global population — experienced a neurological condition in 2021, far more than had previously been thought, the analysis found.The study was carried out by hundreds of researchers led by the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), which has become a global reference for health statistics.Lead study author Jaimie Steinmetz of the IHME said the results showed that nervous system conditions are now “the world’s leading cause of overall disease burden”.Cases of these conditions have soared by 59 percent in the last three decades, she said, with the increase mainly driven by the fact that the world’s population was ageing and growing fast.The researchers looked at how 37 different neurological conditions affected ill health, disability and premature death across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021.This data was used to estimate how many years of healthy life were lost to each condition, called disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).More than 443 million years of healthy life were lost to nervous system disorders globally in 2021, an 18-percent increase from 1990, the study found.However, if the population’s age and growing size was adjusted for, DALYs and deaths from these conditions actually fell by around a third, the researchers said.Stroke, which was previously counted as a heart disease, was by far the worst neurological condition analysed, accounting for 160 million years of healthy life lost.It was followed by a form of brain damage called neonatal encephalopathy, migraine, dementia including Alzheimer’s disease, nerve damage from diabetes, meningitis and epilepsy.Cognitive impairment from Covid-19 ranked 20th.The main reason that nervous system conditions surpassed cardiovascular disease in the latest analysis was a recent World Health Organization classification change that moved stroke into the neurological category, Steinmetz told AFP.The massive number of healthy years lost from these conditions was partly because several can kill children under five, such trauma during birth leading to neonatal encephalopathy, asphyxia or meningitis, she said.“Because deaths occur at a young age, this creates a large contribution to years of life lost,” she added.Children accounted for nearly a fifth of all healthy years lost, the study found.More than 11 million people died from the 37 neurological conditions in 2021, according to the study in The Lancet Neurology journal.However cardiovascular disease remained the leading cause of death, killing 19.8 million people worldwide in 2022, the IHME said last year.The most common neurological disorders were tension headaches and migraines.The quickest-growing condition was nerve damage called diabetic neuropathy from soaring cases of diabetes.Most of these conditions have no cure.But there are ways to lessen the risk, including reducing rates of high blood pressure, diabetes and alcohol consumption, the researchers said.They called for much more to be done to prevent, treat and rehabilitate the disorders, which disproportionately affect poorer countries.“The worldwide neurological burden is growing very fast and will put even more pressure on health systems in the coming decades,” warned study co-author Valery Feigin.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/man-in-iron-lung-dead-at-78-family/,‘Man in iron lung’ dead at 78: family,1,"A polio survivor known as the “man in the iron lung” has died aged 78, according to his family and a fundraising website.Paul Alexander of Dallas, Texas contracted polio at the age of six, leaving him paralyzed from the neck down and reliant on a mechanical respirator to breathe for much of the time.Though often confined to his submarine-like cylinder, he excelled in his studies, earned a law degree, worked in the legal field and wrote a book.“With a heavy heart I need to say my brother passed last night,” Philip Alexander posted on Facebook early Wednesday. “It was an honor to be part of someone’s life who was as admired as he was.”Christopher Ulmer, a disability advocate running a fundraiser for Alexander, also confirmed his death in a GoFundMe update posted on Tuesday.“His story traveled wide and far, positively influencing people around the world. Paul was an incredible role model that will continue to be remembered,” said Ulmer.A prior update on Alexander’s official TikTok account said he had been rushed to the emergency room after contracting Covid-19.Iron lungs are sealed chambers fitted with pumps. Raising and lowering the pressure inside the chamber expands and contracts the patient’s lungs.Invented in the 1920s, their use fell away after the invention of the polio vaccine by Jonas Salk, which became widely available in 1955 and helped consign the devastating paralytic illness to history.Alexander held the official Guinness World Record for time spent in a lung.According to his Guinness page, he was able to leave the device for periods of time after he learned to “frog breathe” with the help of a physical therapist.This involved “using his throat muscles to force air into his lungs, gulping down air one mouthful at a time.” Eventually, he only returned to his iron lung at night to sleep.As a practicing lawyer, he was able to represent clients in court in a special wheelchair that held his paralyzed body upright.Seventy-five-year-old Martha Lillard of Shawnee, Oklahoma is reportedly the last surviving person in an iron lung.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/whale-menopause-sheds-light-on-human-evolutionary-mystery/,Whale menopause sheds light on human evolutionary mystery,1,"Why do humans experience menopause? It’s a question that some women going through the symptoms might have asked themselves more than once.Scientists are also baffled. From an evolutionary perspective, animals generally take every chance they can get to have as many offspring as possible to boost their odds of survival.So why have some species evolved to have menopause, in which females live many years after they stop being able to reproduce?That there are so few other examples in the animal kingdom only deepens the mystery.Out of 5,000 mammals, just five species of whales with teeth — including killer whales, beluga whales and narwhals — are the only others known to have females that regularly live long after they stop reproducing.However plenty of other toothed whales, such as dolphins, do not experience menopause.By looking at the differences between these two groups, a UK-led team of researchers sought to discover why some whales evolved to get menopause — and what this could tell us about ourselves.Despite our many differences, humans share a “convergent life history” with these ocean giants that led to the independent evolution of menopause, the researchers concluded in a study published in Nature on Wednesday.Their results tied together several existing hypotheses. The first piece of the puzzle involving lifespan. Females of the five species that have menopause live roughly 40 years longer than other similar-sized whales, the researchers found.These female whales also easily outlive males of their own kind.Female killer whales “regularly live into their 60s and 70s, but the males are all dead by 40,” lead study author Samuel Ellis of the UK’s University of Exeter told an online press conference.This supports what is known as the “grandmother hypothesis” — that older females care for their grandchildren, therefore helping their species survive in a different way.But why would it be an evolutionary advantage for these grandmothers to stop having offspring?“The second part of this story is about competition,” study co-author Darren Croft said.When killer whale “mothers and daughters try and breed at the same time, the calves of the older females” have a significantly lower survival rate as they compete for resources, he said.“So they have evolved a longer lifespan while keeping a short reproductive lifespan,” Croft added.“This is just the same pattern of life history we see in humans.”Though we walk on land and they swim through the ocean, the similarities between human and whale social structures is “absolutely striking”, Croft said. “Older matriarchs” play an important role within both societies, he said.For example, the experience older females have gathered over their lives helps the whale families get through hard times such as environmental challenges or a lack of food.But just having a matriarchal society is not enough. Older female elephants, for example, look after their offspring but keep reproducing until the end of their lives.The key difference could be that older whale mothers keep looking after their sons, Croft said. Young male elephants, however, leave the family group.Both sons and daughters sticking around could even be a unique trait to the five whales — and humans — that get menopause, he speculated.Rebecca Sear, an evolutionary demographer and anthropologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine not involved in the study, cautioned that this could not “provide definitive answers to the question of why menopause evolved”.Whales are incredibly difficult to study, and a lot of the data used for the research was from unnatural events such as mass strandings, she commented in Nature.Meanwhile, there has been increasing criticism that menopause in human women remains badly under-researched due to a long-standing male-skewed bias in medical research.“Human grandmothers, like whale grandmothers, are important in the lives of their adult children and grandchildren, but older women are too often ignored in policy circles and public health research,” Sear said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/mourners-gather-as-liberia-approaches-decade-since-ebola-outbreak/,Mourners gather as Liberia approaches decade since Ebola outbreak,1,"Dozens of mourners gathered to clear graves at Liberia’s largest Ebola burial site on Wednesday, as the country approached 10 years since the virus first swept through the population.The West African nation was badly hit by the region’s Ebola pandemic, which raged from 2014 to 2016 and killed 4,810 people in Liberia alone.The country’s first cases were confirmed on March 30, 2014, according to the World Health Organization.“It is very hard for us. We see that there are a lot of children here… and we know some of the kids lost parents,” said Pastor Charles Brown, who set up an orphanage for children whose parents died during the Ebola crisis.Wednesday marked Liberia’s annual “Decoration Day”, when relatives of the deceased traditionally visit cemeteries to pay their respects.The Disco Hill cemetery just south of the capital Monrovia was originally designed to hold Ebola victims, but now also houses the remains of those who died during the Covid-19 pandemic.The graveyard holds some 4,500 bodies, according to E. Jefferson Dahnlo, health care waste manager at the National Public Health Institute of Liberia.As mourners made their way through the site, small groups stopped to clear plots of land and commemorate their loved ones.“I have come to honour my mother,” said Yassa Johnson, as she stood beside a hut containing her mother’s ashes.Johnson said her mother’s body had been cremated at the height of the Ebola pandemic, but denied that she had died of the virus.A sense of collective denial is widespread in Liberia, and many relatives of victims still refuse to blame Ebola for the death of their loved ones.Johnson said she wanted the Liberian government to introduce a support programme for those left behind.President Joseph Boakai marked Decoration Day by visiting the graves of former heads of state in Monrovia."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-lowered-life-expectancy-by-1-6-years-worldwide-study/,Covid lowered life expectancy by 1.6 years worldwide: study,1,"By Daniel Lawler– Covid-19 caused the average life expectancy of people worldwide to fall by 1.6 years during the first two years of the pandemic, a more dramatic decline than previously thought, a major study said Tuesday.This marked a sharp reversal during a decades-long rise in global life expectancy, according to hundreds of researchers sifting through data for the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).“For adults worldwide, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a more profound impact than any event seen in half a century, including conflicts and natural disasters,” said Austin Schumacher, an IHME researcher and lead author of the study published in The Lancet journal.During 2020-2021, life expectancy declined in 84 percent of the 204 countries and territories analysed, “demonstrating the devastating potential impacts” of new viruses, he said in a statement.The rate of death for people over 15 rose by 22 percent for men and 17 percent for women during this time, the researchers estimated.Mexico City, Peru and Bolivia were some of the places were life expectancy fell the most.But there was some good news in the updated estimates of the IHME’s landmark Global Burden of Disease study.Half a million fewer children under the age of five died in 2021 compared to 2019, continuing a long-term decline in child mortality.IHME researcher Hmwe Hmwe Kyu hailed this “incredible progress,” saying the world should now focus on “the next pandemic and addressing the vast disparities in health across countries”.And despite the setback during the pandemic, people still live far longer than they used to.Between 1950 and 2021, the average life expectancy at birth has risen by 23 years, from 49 to 72, the researchers said. Covid was responsible for 15.9 million excess deaths during 2020-2021, either directly from the virus or indirectly due to pandemic-related disruptions, the researchers estimated.That is a million more excess deaths than previously estimated by the World Health Organization.Excess deaths are calculated by comparing the total number of deaths with how many would have been expected if there had not been a pandemic.Barbados, New Zealand and Antigua and Barbuda were among the countries with the lowest rate of excess deaths during the pandemic, partly reflecting how isolated islands were often spared the full brunt of Covid.The study also showed how the populations of many ageing, well-off countries have started to decrease, while numbers continue to grow in less wealthy countries.This dynamic “will bring about unprecedented social, economic, and political challenges, such as labour shortages in areas where younger populations are shrinking and resource scarcity in places where population size continues to expand rapidly,” Schumacher warned.“Nations around the world will need to cooperate on voluntary emigration,” he added."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/s-korea-starts-process-to-suspend-licences-of-4900-striking-doctors/,S. Korea starts process to suspend licences of 4,1,"By Kang Jin-kyu – South Korea said Monday it had started procedures to suspend the medical licences of 4,900 junior doctors who have resigned and stopped working to protest government medical training reforms, causing healthcare chaos.The walkout, which started February 20, is over government plans to sharply increase the number of doctors, which it says is essential to combat shortages and serve South Korea’s rapidly ageing population. Medics argue the increase will erode service quality.Nearly 12,000 junior doctors — 93 percent of the trainee workforce — were not in their hospitals at the last count, despite government back-to-work orders and threats of legal action, forcing Seoul to mobilise military medics and millions of dollars in state reserves to ease the situation.The health ministry on Monday said it had sent administrative notifications — the first step towards suspending medical licences — to thousands of trainee doctors after they defied specific orders telling them to return to their hospitals.“As of March 8 (notifications) have been sent to more than 4,900 trainee doctors,” Chun Byung-wang, director of the health and medical policy division at the health ministry, told reporters.The government has previously warned striking doctors that they face a three-month suspension of their licences, a punishment it says will delay by at least a year their ability to qualify as specialists.Chun urged the striking medics to return to their patients.“The government will take into account the circumstance and protect trainee doctors if they return to work before the administrative measure is complete,” he said, indicating that doctors who come back to work now could avoid the punishment.“The government will not give up dialogue. The door for dialogue is always open … The government will respect and listen to opinions of the medical community as a companion for the medical reforms,” he added.The government last week announced new measures to improve pay and conditions for trainee medics, plus a review of the continuous 36-hour work period, which is a major gripe of junior doctors.The strikes have led to surgery cancellations, long wait times and delayed treatments at major hospitals.Seoul has denied that there is a full-blown healthcare crisis, but Chun said that military doctors will start working in civilian hospitals from Wednesday this week.The government is pushing to admit 2,000 more students to medical schools annually from next year to address what it calls one of the lowest doctor-to-population ratios among developed nations.Doctors say they fear the reform will erode the quality of service and medical education, but proponents accuse medics of trying to safeguard their salaries and social status.Under South Korean law, doctors are restricted from striking, and the health ministry has asked police to investigate people connected to the work stoppage.The plan enjoys broad public support, but a new poll by local media found some 34 percent of people believe the warring sides should start negotiating properly.“Doctors and the government are not in a boxing ring,” said an editorial published Monday in the Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper, urging Seoul and the doctors to resume talks.“People’s patience is wearing thin… The exit from this quagmire must be found through dialogue between the two sides,” it added."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/few-women-know-alcohol-linked-to-breast-cancer-who-europe/,900 striking doctors,1,"Just one in five women in Europe are aware that alcohol is a risk factor for developing breast cancer, a “major” health concern in the region, the World Health Organization warned Friday.“Only 21 percent of women across 14 European countries were aware of the connection between alcohol consumption and the risk of developing breast cancer,” the European branch of the WHO said in a statement, noting that awareness was even lower among men.“Just 10 percent of the men surveyed knew of this link.”The WHO Europe comprises 53 countries and includes Central Asia.Some 600,000 cases of breast cancer were reported in Europe in 2022.The WHO did not provide its own data on how many of those cases were alcohol-related.But it cited 2020 data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which showed that of 575,917 new breast cancer cases, 39,248 were alcohol-attributable, or around seven percent.“The role of alcohol as a preventable risk factor for breast cancer is critical,” the WHO said.For women in Europe, breast cancer is “the primary cancer caused by alcohol, making up 66 percent of all cases of alcohol-attributable cancers,” it said.Alcohol consumption affects levels of oestrogen, which plays a significant role in the development and progression of many breast cancers.Even relatively low levels of alcohol consumption can contribute to the risk of developing breast cancer, the agency warned.“More than half of all breast cancer cases attributable to alcohol in Europe are not due to heavy drinking, and about one third of new cases every year are due to drinking the equivalent of up to two small glasses of wine per day.”The WHO called for new national policies to bring about a change in drinking habits across Europe, noting that there have been “no changes in alcohol consumption per capita in the European Union since 2010”.Breast cancer is the second-most detected cancer, with 2.3 million cases worldwide in 2022, according to the WHO.The 14 countries included in the European study were Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/quit-medicine-for-farming-south-korean-doctors-speak-out/,Few women know alcohol linked to breast cancer: WHO Europe,1,"From the outside, Seoul’s main hospitals seem unchanged: ambulances pull up, patients walk in, staff in white coats walk around purposefully. But for weeks, South Korean healthcare has been struggling.Surgeries have been cancelled, crucial chemotherapy sessions delayed, and it is nearly impossible to get a walk-in appointment since thousands of junior doctors walked off the job on February 20 in a standoff with the government over medical training reforms.AFP spoke with those involved: The medical reforms, which seek to train up more doctors, plus the government’s “draconian” reaction to doctors’ opposition is, junior medics say, enough to drive some of them out of the profession for good.“After this situation is over, I plan to go to a rural area in Yeongdong, North Chungcheong Province, to cultivate grapes,” Ryu Ok Hada, a trainee doctor who resigned, said.Other doctors are thinking: “I could live a happier life by going to the United States and running a food truck. I could make people happy without feeling this level of humiliation,” he told reporters.Junior doctors say they are overworked and underpaid, and argue the reforms will erode service quality while doing nothing to fix core issues in healthcare provision.“Even if a large number of doctors are produced, if they do not work in essential medical areas and instead move to private clinics or other fields, it does not align with the (government’s) initial purpose,” Park Dan, the head of the Korean Intern Resident Association, told local media. Due to existing shortages of doctors and a concentration of medical professionals in the capital Seoul, patients like Jang Sung-ja, who has ovarian cancer, already have to travel hundreds of kilometers for treatment.But since the doctors went on strike, her treatment has been paused.“I live in Daegu and the hospital is in Seoul, and I’m just waiting to hear back from them after being informed that the session has been postponed,” she said.“The hospital doesn’t really answer when you call them and my children are very worried about me.”Delays and a lack of clarity around treatment plans are increasingly common for patients with major illnesses, which patient advocacy group the Korea Severe Disease Association, says is unacceptable.“Patients are still missing out on the golden time for treatment,” they said in a statement, blaming both striking doctors and the government for the dire situation. For years, successive South Korean governments have attempted to increase medical school enrollment figures and create more doctors to ease shortages, but such reforms have always been abandoned in the face of staunch opposition from medics.This time, the government is standing by its plan, saying that without rapid reforms the country will not have enough doctors to deal with its rapidly ageing population.The reforms “cannot and should not be the subject of negotiation or compromise,” President Yoon Suk Yeol said.The plan will see 2,000 more students admitted to medical schools annually from next year to address what Seoul says is one of the lowest doctor-to-population ratios among developed nations.Doctors who refuse to return to work face legal action, including the suspension of their medical licenses. Senior doctors have not joined the strikes — but many have publicly sympathised with their junior colleague’s plight, claiming the government training reforms will not do much to fix broader issues.“Who would benefit the most when there is an excess of trainees in a field? It would be the directors of general hospitals, wouldn’t it?” said Chung Jin-haeng, a professor at Seoul National University’s college of medicine.“With an abundance of inexpensive medical personnel, they can assign all of the night shifts to them,” she told local media. South Korea has a government-funded health insurance system which ensures no one will be denied life-saving treatment.But activists say inequalities still exist.The healthcare system’s biggest problem is that most doctors are concentrated in Seoul, leading to access issues in rural areas.The private sector also dominates provision, with state-run institutions accounting for just five percent of the total number of hospitals nationwide.“Regardless of who wins this battle between doctors and the government, neither party has the ability to establish a truly essential alternative — an enhanced public healthcare system,” healthcare activist Yi Seo-young told AFP."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/bangkok-says-work-from-home-as-pollution-blankets-city/,Bangkok says work from home as pollution blankets city,1,"– Bangkok city employees have been told to work from home to avoid harmful air pollution, as a layer of noxious haze blanketed the Thai capital on Thursday.City authorities asked for cooperation from employers to help workers in the city of some 11 million people avoid the pollution, which is expected to last into Friday.The air monitoring website IQAir ranked Bangkok among the 10 most polluted cities in the world on Thursday morning.Levels of the most dangerous PM2.5 particles — so tiny they can enter the bloodstream — were more than 15 times the World Health Organization’s annual guideline, according to IQAir.Bangkok governor Chadchart Sittipunt said late Wednesday that all city employees would work from home on Thursday and Friday.“I would like to ask for cooperation from the BMA network of about 151 companies and organisations, both government offices and the private sector,” he said in a statement, adding that more than 60,000 people were affected.BMA is an abbreviation for the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration.Chadchart said at least 20 of Bangkok’s 50 districts were expected to have unhealthy levels of PM2.5 particles, and the problem would linger because of calm weather.Air quality in Thailand regularly plummets in the early months of the year as smoke from farmers burning stubble in the fields adds to industrial emissions and vehicle exhaust fumes.Bangkok and the northern city of Chiang Mai ranked among the most polluted cities in the world on a number of days last year.A public health crisis is brewing over the problem, with at least two million people in Thailand needing medical treatment because of pollution in 2023.The government of Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, which took over in August, has promised to make tackling air pollution a “national agenda”, and a draft Clean Air Act was endorsed by his cabinet last month.But the problem persists, and a court in Chiang Mai last month ordered the government to come up with an urgent plan to tackle air pollution within 90 days."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/first-child-cured-of-rare-brain-tumour-offers-real-hope/,First child cured of rare brain tumour ‘offers real hope’,1,"When Lucas was diagnosed with a rare type of brain tumour at the age of six, there was no doubting the prognosis.French doctor Jacques Grill gets emotional when he remembers having to tell Lucas’s parents that their son was going to die.However, seven years later, Lucas is now 13 years old and there is no trace of the tumour left.The Belgian boy is the first child in the world to have been cured of brainstem glioma, a particularly brutal cancer, according to the researchers who treated him.“Lucas beat all the odds” to survive, said Grill, head of the brain tumour programme at the Gustave Roussy cancer centre in Paris.The tumour, which has the full name diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), is diagnosed every year in around 300 children in the United States, and up to 100 in France.Ahead of International Childhood Cancer Day on Thursday, the medical community has praised advances that mean 85 percent of children now survive more than five years after being diagnosed with cancer.But the outlook for children with the DIPG tumour remains grim — most do not live a year beyond diagnosis. A recent study found that only 10 percent were alive two years on.Radiotherapy can sometimes slow the rapid march of the aggressive tumour, but no drug has been shown to be effective against it. Lucas and his family travelled from Belgium to France so that he could become one of the first patients to join the BIOMEDE trial which tests potential new drugs for DIPG.From the start, Lucas responded strongly to the cancer drug everolimus, which he was randomly assigned.“Over a series of MRI scans, I watched as the tumour completely disappeared,” Grill told AFP.But the doctor did not dare stop the treatment regimen — at least until a year and a half ago, when Lucas revealed he was no longer taking the drugs anyways.“I don’t know of any other case like him in the world,” Grill said.Exactly why Lucas so fully recovered, and how his case could help other children like him in the future, remains to be seen.Seven other children in the trial survived years after being diagnosed, but only Lucas’s tumour completely vanished.The reason these children responded to the drugs, while others did not, was likely due to the “biological particularities” of their individual tumours, Grill said.“Lucas’s tumour had an extremely rare mutation which we believe made its cells far more sensitive to the drug,” he added. The researchers are studying the genetic abnormalities of patients’ tumours as well as creating tumour “organoids,” which are masses of cells produced in the lab.“Lucas’s case offers real hope,” said Marie-Anne Debily, a researcher supervising the lab work.“We will try to reproduce in vitro the differences that we have identified in his cells,” she told AFP.The team want to reproduce his genetic differences in the organoids to see if the tumour can then be killed off as effectively as it was in Lucas.If that works, the “next step will be to find a drug that has the same effect on tumour cells as these cellular changes,” Debily said.While the researchers are excited about this new lead, they warned that any possible treatment is still a long way off.“On average, it takes 10-15 years from the first lead to become a drug — it’s a long and drawn-out process,” Grill said.David Ziegler, a paediatric oncologist at Sydney Children’s Hospital in Australia, said that the landscape for DIPG has dramatically changed over the last decade.Breakthroughs in the lab, increased funding and trials such as BIOMEDE make “me convinced that we will soon find that we are able to cure some patients,” Ziegler told AFP."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-officials-confirm-rare-human-case-of-bubonic-plague/,US officials confirm rare human case of bubonic plague,1,"– Officials in the US state of Oregon have said they are dealing with a rare human case of bubonic plague that was likely transmitted by a pet cat.The disease, which killed at least a third of Europe’s population in the Middle Ages during a pandemic known as the “Black Death,” is uncommon in developed countries and can now be treated, but remains potentially dangerous.The identity of the patient in Deschutes County has not been revealed, but officials said they were being treated, adding that the individual was most likely infected by their cat.“All close contacts of the resident and their pet have been contacted and provided medication to prevent illness,” said Dr. Richard Fawcett, Deschutes County Health Officer in the announcement of the case last week.Authorities said plague symptoms in humans begin up to eight days after exposure to an infected animal or flea.Symptoms may include fever, nausea, weakness, chills and muscle aches. If not diagnosed early, bubonic plague can progress to septicemic plague — an infection of the bloodstream — or pneumonic plague, which affects the lungs. Both are much more serious.“Fortunately, this case was identified and treated in the earlier stages of the disease, posing little risk to the community,” a statement said.“No additional cases of plague have emerged during the communicable disease investigation.”The Oregon Health Authority said plague is rare in the area, with the last case reported in 2015.The Black Death swept through Europe in the 14th Century, killing as many as 50 million people in one of the deadliest pandemics in human history."

It has registered 36 deaths since December, including 12 children, officials there said.Rio de Janeiro, Brazil’s second-biggest city, after Sao Paulo, also declared a public health emergency Monday, four days ahead of the official opening of its famed carnival.Authorities announced the opening of 10 dedicated treatment centers to alleviate pressure on Rio’s overwhelmed hospitals.“It’s a good thing they opened this center. The hospitals can’t handle the situation alone,” patient Luciana Ferreira told AFP in the working-class Curicica neighborhood.The capital, Brasilia, has opened an emergency field hospital.Brazil registered 345,235 likely cases of dengue in the first five weeks of the year, nearly four times the number registered over the same period last year.Thirty-one people have died of dengue, according to the Brazilian health ministry, which is still analyzing another 234 deaths that may have been caused by the disease.Sao Paulo is testing a drone that uses larvicide to combat mosquitos in hard-to-reach areas.Brazil plans to start a public vaccination campaign against dengue this month — though a lack of doses from the vaccine’s maker, Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda, means only children ages 10 to 14 will be targeted.Brazil’s government says it is studying options to produce a dengue vaccine domestically.Dengue, which can cause hemorrhagic fever, infects an estimated 100 million to 400 million people yearly, though most cases are mild or asymptomatic, according to the World Health Organization."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/thai-government-says-will-ban-recreational-cannabis-use/,Thai government says will ban recreational cannabis use,1,"The Thai government will urgently move a bill to ban the recreational use of cannabis, the health minister said on Tuesday, after the kingdom decriminalised the drug in 2022.Cannabis was taken off the list of banned narcotics in June 2022 under the previous government, which included the pro-legalisation Bhumjaithai party.The move prompted hundreds of cannabis dispensaries to sprout around the country, particularly in Bangkok, provoking concern from critics who urged the need for tighter legislation.On Tuesday, the kingdom’s health minister said the new bill — which bans the recreational use of cannabis — will be proposed to the cabinet meeting next week.“The new bill will be amended from the existing one to only allow the use of cannabis for health and medicinal purposes,” Chonlanan Srikaew told reporters.“The use for fun is considered wrong.”Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, who took office last August, has frequently voiced his opposition to the recreational use of the drug and said it should only be allowed for medicinal use.There was fresh pressure from the public last weekend after attendees of British rock band Coldplay’s shows in Bangkok complained on social media saying “the entire concert smelled like marijuana”."

I did not know it was pneumonia but I was sure something was really wrong,” Liaquat said.The first question doctors asked him was whether Ali was fully immunised, which he was, spurring his road to recovery. But many are not, according to senior doctor Junaid Rashid.“We feel uncomfortable when a child comes to us with the disease and he has not been vaccinated,” the 55-year-old medic said.Pakistan offers free jabs for respiratory disease at six, 10 and 14 weeks of age.But Islamabad has long grappled with the challenge of increasing vaccine uptake in a nation where misinformation is rife and some fringe clerics declare it un-Islamic.Premature births and stunting caused by malnutrition are also prevalent, weakening children who are then easy prey for pneumonia."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/five-key-facts-about-cancer/,Five key facts about cancer,1,"By Olivier THIBAULT– With nearly 10 million deaths and nearly 20 million new cases in 2022, cancer remains one of the world’s biggest killers, according to a report on Thursday by the World Health Organization.Here are five key facts about the disease ahead of World Cancer Day on Sunday:Cancer — a disease that causes abnormal cells to multiply and spread — affects humans and virtually all other animal species, with traces found in human skeletons dating from prehistoric times.There are more than 100 types of cancer, each with its own diagnosis and treatment. Around one in nine men and one in 12 women will die from cancer.An estimated 9.74 million people died from cancer in 2022 and 19.96 million new cases were recorded, according to a report by the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) published on Thursday.On average, one person in five will develop some form of cancer in their lifetime, with the number of global cases growing by over 25 percent between 2009 and 2019, according to the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.The IARC predicted the number of new cases of cancer recorded in the year 2040 would be 50 percent higher than the 19.96 million recorded in 2022.In 2050, the number is predicted to be 77 percent higher than in 2022.“There is a large increase in the cancer burden,” said Dr Freddie Bray, head of the IARC’s cancer surveillance unit.The three most common cancers are lung cancer (12.4 percent of new cases in 2022), breast cancer (11.6 percent) and colon cancer (9.6 percent.In terms of deaths, lung cancer is by far the deadliest, accounting for 18.7 percent of deaths, ahead of colon cancer (9.3 percent), liver cancer (7.8 percent) and breast cancer (6.9 percent).Around half of the new cases in 2022 were in Asia, which is home to more than half the world’s population.What is more surprising is that Europe, including Russia, accounted for a quarter of all the new cases, although it represents under 10 percent of Earth’s inhabitants.“Many countries in Europe have among the highest incidence rates of common cancers worldwide such as prostate and female breast,” Bray told AFP.By contrast, fewer than six percent of cancer cases in 2022 were in Africa, home to one in five people but which has the youngest population in the world.Africa’s youthfulness can explain the low prevalence of many types of cancer, apart from cervical cancer, where is particularly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.Three-quarters of all the new cancer cases in 2022 were among people aged over 55.Under-29s accounted for fewer than three percent of the cases despite accounting for nearly 50 percent of the world’s population.The risk of cancer rises steeply as people age because cells in the body become damaged over time and start to behave differently, leading in some cases to cancer.Some of the damage happens by chance but some is caused by external factors such as drinking, smoking and exposure to UV radiation.Cancer kills more men than women, with men accounting for 56 out of every 100 cancer deaths, compared to 44 for women.The fact that men are bigger smokers, which makes them more at risk of lung cancer — the deadliest of all cancer types — is chiefly blamed for the disparity.But women “endure almost the same burden of cancer overall and disproportionately so at younger ages”, Bray told AFP."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/new-cancer-cases-to-soar-77-by-2050-who/,New cancer cases to soar 77% by 2050: WHO,1,"– The number of new cancer cases will rise to more than 35 million in 2050 — 77 percent higher than the figure in 2022, the World Health Organization’s cancer agency warned Thursday.The WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) cited tobacco, alcohol, obesity and air pollution as key factors in the estimated rise.“Over 35 million new cancer cases are predicted in 2050”, a statement said, a 77-percent increase from the some 20 million cases diagnosed in 2022.“The rapidly-growing global cancer burden reflects both population ageing and growth, as well as changes to people’s exposure to risk factors, several of which are associated with socioeconomic development.“Tobacco, alcohol and obesity are key factors behind the increasing incidence of cancer, with air pollution still a key driver of environmental risk factors.”The most-developed countries are expected to record the greatest increases in case numbers, with an additional 4.8 million new cases predicted in 2050 compared with 2022 estimates, the WHO said.But in terms of percentages, countries on the low end of the Human Development Index (HDI) used by the UN will see the greatest proportional increase — up 142 percent.And countries in the medium range are due to record a 99-percent increase, it said.“Likewise, cancer mortality in these countries is projected to almost double in 2050,” the WHO said.Freddie Bray, head of the cancer surveillance branch at IARC, said: “The impact of this increase will not be felt evenly across countries of different HDI levels.“Those who have the fewest resources to manage their cancer burdens will bear the brunt of the global cancer burden.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/more-than-one-billion-now-afflicted-by-obesity-lancet/,More than one billion now afflicted by obesity: Lancet,1,"More than one billion people around the world are now suffering from obesity with the number having more than quadrupled since 1990, according to a study released by the Lancet medical journal.The “epidemic” is particularly hitting poorer countries and the rate is growing among children and adolescents faster than adults, according to the study carried out with the World Health Organization.The study, released ahead of World Obesity Day on March 4, estimated that there were about 226 million obese adults, adolescents and children in the world in 1990. The figure had risen to 1,038 million in 2022.Francesco Branca, director of nutrition for health at the WHO, said the rise past one billion people has come “much earlier than we have anticipated”.While doctors knew obesity numbers were rising fast, the symbolic figure had previously been expected in 2030.Researchers analysed the weight and height measurements of more than 220 million people in more than 190 countries to reach the estimates, Lancet said.They estimated that 504 million adult women and 374 million men were obese in 2022. The study said the obesity rate had nearly tripled for men (14 percent) since 1990 and more than doubled for women (18.5 percent).Some 159 million children and adolescents were living with obesity in 2022, according to the study, up from about 31 million in 1990.The chronic and complex illness is accompanied by a greater risk of death from heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers. Being overweight increased the risk of death during the coronavirus pandemic.Countries in Polynesia and Micronesia, the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa have suffered more from the rise.“These countries now have higher obesity rates than many high-income industrialised countries, especially those in Europe,” the study said.“In the past we have tended to think of obesity as a problem of the rich, now a problem of the world,” said Branca, who highlighted the fast lifestyle changes in low and middle-income countries. The “very rapid transformation of the food systems is not for the better”.Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London, the study’s lead author, said there were signs that obesity was levelling out in some southern European countries such as France and Spain, “especially for women”.But he said that in most countries there are more people suffering from obesity than being under-weight, which the study said had fallen since 1990.While not eating enough is the main cause of being under-weight, eating badly is a prime factor for obesity.“This new study highlights the importance of preventing and managing obesity from early life to adulthood, through diet, physical activity, and adequate care, as needed,” said WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.He added that “getting back on track” to meet global targets for cutting obesity rates “requires the cooperation of the private sector, which must be accountable for the health impacts of their products”.The WHO has supported taxes on sugary drinks, limiting the marketing of unhealthy foods to children and increasing subsidies for healthy foods.Experts say that new treatments against diabetes can also help combat obesity.Branca said the new drugs “are an important tool but not a solution of the problem”.“Obesity is a long-term issue and it is important to look at the impact of these drugs on long-term effects or side effects,” he added."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/ukraine-women-fear-premature-birth-at-frontline-hospital/,Ukraine women fear premature birth at frontline hospital,1,"With a pink jumper covering her round belly, Yana Lyakh was all smiles at a Ukraine hospital even as she recounted what for most women would be a nightmare situation.The 26-year-old is eight months pregnant, her husband is away fighting on the front line and her home town is being relentlessly bombed and shelled by Russian forces.In search of a safe place, she moved into a maternity ward weeks ahead of her due date in the town of Pokrovsk, in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.“I’m here because of the stress,” she told AFP from her bed in a hospital room she shares with another expectant mother.This maternity hospital is the only one in the entire Donbas region with a neonatal unit and incubators for babies born prematurely.Despite air raid alerts and shelling, it has worked constantly since Russia invaded almost two years ago.Lyakh used to live in Myrnograd, a town a few kilometres to the east and closer to the front line.Russia started shelling both towns on January 6 when it killed 11 people, including five children, she said.Spooked by air raid warnings and the risk of bombs falling on her apartment block, heavily pregnant Lyakh “used to run from the fifth floor down to the first”, she said.“That’s why I came here. There was a threat” of giving birth prematurely, she said.In another bed in the ward, 20-year-old Katya Brendyuchkova — also eight months pregnant — was hooked up to a drip.“I’m having difficulties now. There is a possibility of premature delivery,” she said.Her husband is not a soldier, but works in a coal mine in Pokrovsk. Pokrovsk is around 30 kilometres (18 miles) from one of the hottest spots on the sprawling front line: the raging battle for Avdiivka, a strategic town that Russian forces have been trying to seize for months.In the two-storey maternity hospital, some windows were protected by sandbags.Part of the basement has been converted into a bomb shelter and generators provide power when the electricity cuts out.Gynaecologists and nurses have left and patient numbers are also down after most residents fled eastern Ukraine at the start of the invasion.Lyubov Datsyk, head of the obstetrics department, said births had halved from around 1,000 a year before the war to 500 in 2022 and 622 last year.Around 20 percent of the babies delivered in 2023 were premature, up from 10 percent before the war.Doctors are in no doubt the Russian invasion is to blame.“Premature birth is caused by stress, chronic stress. Given that our patients are in a sort of grey zone and the whole of the Donetsk region is a war zone, the number of premature births has increased,” said Ivan Tsyganok, head of the maternity unit.That stress is aggravated by the fact that half of the women have husbands at the front.“The women are worried about both their husbands and their children,” Datsyk said. There have been cases of fathers being killed while their wives were in hospital, staff said.Sometimes they decide not to tell the mother until after the birth, Datsyk said.Otherwise, the expectant mother “knows she is a widow”, she said.The Russian invasion hangs over the children even before they are born.“When we have our children, we want them to have a bright future. But today, they are born and it’s war. They are children of war,” Tsyganok told AFP.Lyakh is planning to travel to give birth in Dnipro, a large city 150 kilometres to the west.After that, she and her daughter, whom she plans to name Sofia, will move to the capital Kyiv.Her husband is a 23-year-old lieutenant fighting in Avdiivka to hold off Russian forces.He visits her once a week in hospital.“He should get transferred (close to Kyiv), so we’ll be spending more time together. We’re looking forward to it,” Lyakh said.Brendyuchkova, who already has a three-year-old girl, said she was scared by the constant bombing and would like to leave.“I want to go somewhere else,” she said. “But so far, there’s no chance. And as long as my husband has a stable job, we’ll stay here for the time being.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/prehistoric-chewing-gum-sheds-light-on-stone-age-diet/,Prehistoric ‘chewing gum’ sheds light on Stone Age diet,1,"DNA from a type of “chewing gum” used by teenagers in Sweden 10,000 years ago is shedding new light on the Stone Age diet and oral health, researchers said Tuesday.The wads of gum are made of pieces of birch bark pitch, a tar-like black resin, and are combined with saliva, with teethmarks clearly visible.They were found 30 years ago next to bones at the 9,700-year-old Huseby Klev archaeological site north of Sweden’s western city of Gothenburg, one of the country’s oldest sites for human fossils.The hunter-gatherers most likely chewed the resin “to be used as glue” to assemble tools and weapons, said Anders Gotherstrom, co-author of a study published in the journal Scientific Reports.“This is a most likely hypothesis — they could of course have been chewed just because they liked them or because they thought that they had some medicinal purpose,” he told AFP.The gum was typically chewed by both male and female adolescents.“There were several chewing gum (samples) and both males and females chewed them. Most of them seem to have been chewed by teenagers,” Gotherstrom said.“There was some kind of age to it.”A previous 2019 study of the wads of gum mapped the genetic profile of the individuals who had chewed it.This time, Gotherstrom and his team of paleontologists at Stockholm University were able to determine, again from the DNA found in the gum, that the teenagers’ Stone Age diet included deer, trout and hazelnuts.Traces of apple, duck and fox were also detected.“If we do a human bone then we’ll get human DNA. We can do teeth and then we’ll get a little bit more. But here we’ll get DNA from what they had been chewing previously,” Gotherstrom said.“You cannot get that in any other way.”In addition, in one piece chewed by a teenage girl researchers found “a number of bacteria indicating a severe case of periodontitis”, a severe gum infection.“She would probably start to lose her teeth shortly after chewing this chewing gum. It must have hurt as well,” said Gotherstrom.“You have the imprint from the teenager’s mouth who chewed it thousands of years ago. If you want to put some kind of a philosophical layer into it, for us it connects artefacts, the DNA and humans,” he said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/deaf-boy-can-now-hear-after-breakthrough-gene-treatment/,Deaf boy can now hear after breakthrough gene treatment,1,"His father’s voice, the sounds of passing cars and scissors clipping his hair: An 11-year-old boy is hearing for the first time in his life after receiving a breakthrough gene therapy.The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) which carried out the treatment — a first in the United States — said in a statement Tuesday the milestone represents hope for patients around the world with hearing loss caused by genetic mutations.Aissam Dam was born “profoundly deaf” because of a highly rare abnormality in a single gene.“Gene therapy for hearing loss is something that we physicians and scientists in the world of hearing loss have been working toward for over 20 years, and it is finally here,” said surgeon John Germiller, director of clinical research for CHOP’s otolaryngology division.“While the gene therapy we performed in our patient was to correct an abnormality in one, very rare gene, these studies may open the door for future use for some of the over 150 other genes that cause childhood hearing loss.”In patients like Aissam, a defective gene prevents the production of otoferlin, a protein necessary for the “hair cells” of the inner ear to be able to convert sound vibrations into chemical signals that are sent to the brain. Otoferlin gene defects are highly rare, accounting for 1 – 8 percent of hearing loss present from birth.On October 4, 2023, he underwent a surgical procedure that involved partly lifting his eardrum and then injecting a harmless virus, which had been modified to transport working copies of the otoferlin gene, into the internal fluid of his cochlea. As a result, the hair cells began making the missing protein and functioning properly.Almost four months since receiving the treatment in one ear, Aissam’s hearing has improved to the point he only has mild-to-moderate hearing loss and he is “literally hearing sound for the first time in his life,” said the statement.The New York Times reported that despite being able to hear, Aissam, who was born in Morocco and later moved to Spain, may never learn to talk, as the brain’s window for acquiring speech closes around the age of five. The US Food and Drug Administration, which greenlighted the study, wanted to start the research on older children first, for safety reasons.The trial, sponsored by Akouos, Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, is one of several underway or about to start in the United States, Europe and China, where a handful of other children have already been reportedly cured.“As more patients at different ages are treated with this gene therapy, researchers will learn more about the degree to which hearing is improved and whether that level of hearing can be sustained over many years,” Germiller said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-coordinator-describes-gaza-hospitals-in-rapid-deterioration/,WHO coordinator describes Gaza hospitals in ‘rapid deterioration’,1,"A World Health Organization official on Wednesday described dire conditions in the Gaza Strip’s remaining hospitals, where patients are “waiting to die” due to extreme shortages of staff and supplies.Emergency medical team coordinator Sean Casey said that during some five weeks he spent in the war-torn Palestinian territory, he saw hospital patients “every day with severe burns, with open fractures waiting hours or days” for treatment.“They would often ask me for food or water — that demonstrates the level of desperation that we see,” Casey told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.He said he was only able to visit six of Gaza’s 16 functioning hospitals, out of 36 that existed before the war broke out.“What I’ve seen personally is a rapid deterioration of the health system alongside a rapidly increasing level of humanitarian aid and diminishing level of humanitarian access particularly to areas in the north of the Strip.”He described seeing patients in the north who were “basically waiting to die in a hospital that has no fuel, no power, no water.”“We tried every single day for seven days to deliver fuel and supplies to the north to Gaza City,” Casey said. “Every day, those requests for coordinated movements were denied.”The hospitals are facing a deluge of patients while operating with minimal staff, many of whom — like the vast majority of Gaza’s population — have been displaced from their homes, Casey said.“Hospital directors were telling me how their surgeons, plastic surgeon, for example, could not do surgery, because he was out collecting sticks to burn his firewood to cook for his family.”Fighting has ravaged Gaza since Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attacks on Israel that resulted in the death of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.At least 24,448 Palestinians, about 70 percent of them women, young children and adolescents, have been killed in Israeli bombardments and ground assaults, according to the Gaza health ministry’s latest figures.Hamas and other militants seized about 250 hostages during the October 7 attacks, and around 132 remain in Gaza, including at least 27 believed to have been killed.Echoing similar calls by WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Casey said the most critical need in Gaza “is really a ceasefire.”“Everything short of that is simply addressing needs on a day by day basis.”In the south, Casey said he visited the Nasser medical complex, where “they had only 30 percent of their staff remaining and about 200 percent of their bed capacity — so patients everywhere in the corridors on the floor.”“I went to the burn unit where there was one physician caring for 100 patients,” he said.The “humanitarian catastrophe that’s unfolding every day is getting worse and worse” Casey said, in addition to “the collapse of the health system day by day.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/madrid-wants-masks-worn-in-hospitals-as-viruses-surge/,Madrid wants masks worn in hospitals as viruses surge,1,"– The Spanish government on Friday called for the wearing of masks to be obligatory in medical facilities as cases of flu and Covid-19 surge with the onset of winter.With the increase in respiratory infections, “we are calling” for the return of obligatory mask-wearing in hospitals and health centres, Health Minister Monica Garcia said on X, formerly Twitter.The minister said she would bring up the subject on Monday at a meeting with regional representatives overseeing health issues.The meeting would enable “coordinated public health action to be taken in the face of the epidemic spikes”.The eastern region of Valencia and Catalonia, in the northeast, announced Friday that health professionals and patients would have to wear masks in medical facilities there.The move came after doctors raised the alarm over mounting cases of flu as well as Covid and other respiratory ailments, particularly in the east of the country.Spain only lifted the obligatory wearing of masks in high-risk facilities such as hospitals, retirement homes and pharmacies in July 2023.Spaniards broadly complied with the obligation to wear masks during the Covid pandemic which saw the badly-hit nation adopt some of the strictest measures in the world to fight the virus."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/doctors-in-england-start-longest-strike-in-nhs-history/,Doctors in England start longest strike in NHS history,1,"– Hospital doctors in England on Wednesday began their longest consecutive strike in the seven-decade history of Britain’s National Service (NHS).Junior doctors — those below consultant level — started a six-day walkout at 0700 GMT, in a major escalation of their long-running pay dispute with the UK government.The industrial action, which ends next Tuesday, comes at one of the busiest times of the year for the state-funded NHS, when it faces increased pressure from winter respiratory illnesses.It also quickly follows a three-day strike held by doctors just before Christmas, part of a wider series of stoppages across several sectors sparked by high inflation and a cost-of-living crisis.Striking doctors say their wages have gone down by a quarter in real terms under the current government, which has been in power since 2010.On a picket line outside St Thomas’ Hospital, across the River Thames from the UK parliament in London, medics held up signs calling for better funding for the overstretched health service.Others read “£15/hour is not a fair wage for a junior doctor” and “Reduced pay keeps the doctor away”, with a map of Australia, which has previously advertised for UK-based staff to move.“A lot of doctors are moving to Australia, not just because of the pay but also the work-life balance is better,” said one doctor, Georgia Blackwell, 28.“Other countries understand that doctors aren’t being paid adequately and they’re offering much better packages,” added Shivani Ganesh, a 23-year-old medical student.UK Health Secretary Victoria Atkins warned that the latest strikes will have a “serious impact” on patients across the country.More than 1.2 million appointments have been rescheduled since the start of the strikes, including more than 88,000 last month, she added.“I urge the BMA Junior Doctors Committee to call off their strikes and come back to the negotiating table so we can find a fair and reasonable solution to end the strikes once and for all,” Atkins said.Junior doctors have gone on strike seven times since March.The British Medical Association (BMA) announced the walkout in December after a breakdown in talks with the government.The union said junior doctors have been offered a 3.0-percent rise on top of the average 8.8-percent increase they were given earlier this year.It rejected the offer because the cash would be split unevenly across different doctor grades and would “still amount to pay cuts for many doctors” after inflation.The co-chair of the BMA Junior Doctors Committee, Robert Laurenson, accused the government of failing to broker new talks.“Strike action is the only thing this government will sit down and listen to,” he told AFP, warning of more strikes to come without a “credible” pay offer.The NHS itself said the latest stoppage, which could see up to half of the medical workforce on picket lines, would have “a significant impact on almost all routine care”.“This January could be one of the most difficult starts to the year the NHS has ever faced,” said its national medical director, Stephen Powis.The NHS typically sees a rise in the number of people in hospital in the two weeks after Christmas, due to people delaying seeking treatment in order to spend the festive season with loved ones.The service is already facing huge backlogs in waiting times for appointments and surgery, blamed on treatment postponement during Covid but also years of under-funding.Julian Hartley, the chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital groups in England, said the effect of the strikes on patients would be “significant”.“The vast majority of planned operations, appointments, and so on, will have to be stood down,” he told BBC television.Consultants will cover for junior doctors and emergency and urgent care such as maternity and intensive care services will be operating.But there are fears that Covid, flu and other seasonal conditions could also hit staffing.“We’re deeply concerned about the kind of impact over the coming days,” said Hartley."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/a-whiff-of-tears-reduces-male-aggression-says-study/,A whiff of tears reduces male aggression,1,"Watching someone cry often evokes an emotional response — but according to a new study published Thursday, human tears themselves contain a chemical signal that reduces brain activity linked to aggression.The research was carried out by the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, and appeared in PLOS Biology, a US science journal. Though it involved female tears, because women made themselves available as donors, it probably isn’t a sex-dependent effect, the authors say.Numerous studies have shown rodent tears contain chemicals serving as social signals they emit on demand — female mice tears for example reduce fighting among males; and subordinate male mole rats smear themselves in their own tears so that dominant males attack them less.To find out whether similar effects occurred in humans, a team led by PhD student Shani Agron first exposed 25 male volunteers to either “emotional” tears, or to saline. The volunteers couldn’t tell what they were sniffing as both substances are clear and odorless.The tears were obtained from six female volunteers who watched sad films in isolation and used a mirror to capture the liquid in a vial as it trickled down their cheeks.“When we looked for volunteers who could donate tears, we found mostly women, because for them it’s much more socially acceptable to cry,” said Agron in a statement.She added that since prior research had shown tears reduce testosterone levels in men, and that lowering testosterone has a greater effect on aggression in men than in women, “we began by studying the impact of tears on men because this gave us higher chances of seeing an effect.”They had the volunteers play a computer game that had been well established in prior aggression studies, and involves accumulating money while a fictitious opponent could steal their earnings.Given the opportunity, the men could get revenge on the other player by causing them to lose money, even though in their own case they would not gain from the opponent’s loss.Such revenge-seeking, aggressive behavior in the game dropped 43.7 percent after men sniffed the tears.This appeared to mirror what had been observed in rodents, but unlike rodents, humans don’t have a structure in their noses called a vomeronasal organ, which was lost during our species’ evolution and detects odorless chemical signals.To find out what was going on, the researchers applied the tears to 62 olfactory receptors in a lab dish and found that four receptors were activated by tears, but not saline.Finally, the scientists repeated the experiments with the men’s brains connected to MRI scanners.The imaging revealed the prefrontal cortex and anterior insula, which are related to aggression, became more active when men were provoked during the game, but the effect was not as strong if they had sniffed tears.“We note that crying often occurs in very close-range interactions, to the extent that ‘kissing teary cheeks’ is a recurring theme across cultures,” wrote the authors, adding that emitting chemical signals to prevent aggression was probably even more important among infants, where verbal communication isn’t possible."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/mapping-bedbugs-s-korean-blockchain-engineer-fights-infestation-with-data/,says study,1,"SEOUL, Dec 19, 2023 (AFP) – When news broke about a bedbug outbreak in his native South Korea, 29-year-old blockchain engineer and self-professed insectophobe Kang Jae-gu got straight to work — on the data.As authorities scrambled to install high-temperature steam heaters at the airport and approve industrial-strength insecticides for home use, Kang started mapping reported infestations.South Korea has been largely bedbug-free for years, but it has seen a surge in infestations as travel has rebounded after the pandemic — with more than 100 cases of the bloodsucking pests reported since late November, official statistics show.And while the public has bugged out — and media coverage has spiralled — thousands of people have turned to Kang’s website, bedbugboard.com, for a sober data-driven look at the outbreak.“I am extremely sensitive to insects, so I sleep under a mosquito net throughout all four seasons,” Kang told AFP.His fear of bedbugs drove him to create an interactive map that shows the approximate locations of reported infestations across the country, as well as real-time news stories on the issue.The site now receives as many as 50,000 visitors a day, up from around 40 when Kang launched it.He used a soothing olive-green colour scheme to try and create “peace of mind” for readers, but he told AFP that having to look at photographs of the critters and their eggs to run the website still gives him “goosebumps”. The bedbug invasion of Seoul comes on the heels of a similar outbreak in Paris, which is set to host the Olympic Games next year.A surge of reported sightings of the creatures sent a shudder through France during the summer and fall — prompting several school closures nationwide.Public concern has also spread to Britain and Algeria.In South Korea, 44 percent of reported cases have been in so-called gosiwon — cheap, tiny housing units typically measuring less than five square metres.Other affected locations include student dormitories, public bathhouses, and extremely small housing units known as jjokbang, which often lack basic amenities such as bathrooms or kitchens.Authorities have swung into gear, with Seoul city government allocating 700 million won ($500,000) to defend residents in vulnerable housing from the invading pests.Incheon International Airport, the main airport serving the capital, plans to install high-temperature steam heaters this month to prevent the entry of the bugs into the country.Seoul also recently approved Neonicotinoids, a class of insecticides used widely on farms, for home use against bedbugs.“The city of Seoul defines the inconvenience and concern of citizens caused by bedbugs as a significant public health issue,” said Park Yu-mi, an official at the Seoul Metropolitan Government.The city “seeks to take the lead in implementing countermeasures,” she added. Bedbugs have appeared in greater numbers in recent decades, mostly due to high population densities, people taking more holidays and mass transit.In France, one in 10 households are believed to have had a bedbug problem over the past few years, usually requiring a pest control operation costing hundreds of euros that often needs to be repeated.The critters bite people to feed on their blood, creating wounds that can be itchy but do not usually cause other health problems.But exposure to bedbug droppings can trigger asthmatic attacks while bites can cause rashes or more severe reactions such as anaphylaxis, and even depression.South Korean experts said the insects are particularly hard to eradicate.“Bedbugs can live for over 100 days even if they do not eat properly. They are thin and also hide well,” Kim Ju-hyeon, a professor at Seoul National University’s school of tropical medicine, said in a YouTube video.Kang plans to keep his website running until the South Korean outbreaks subside.He said he has never personally experienced an infestation, but “I can imagine how stressful it would be if that happened to me”.cdl/ceb/tym"

Korean blockchain engineer fights infestation with data,1,"There was a clear failure in the psychiatric care of the radicalised Islamist suffering from mental troubles who stabbed a German tourist to death in central Paris at the weekend, France’s interior minister said Monday.“There was clearly a failure, not from the point of view of his monitoring by the intelligence services, but a psychiatric failure,” Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told BFM TV, adding the attacker had an “acute mental illness”.“Doctors said on several occasions that he was doing better, was more normal and could be free.”Armand Rajabpour-Miyandoab, a French national of Iranian origin born in 1997, killed a 23-year-old German-Filipino man with two blows from a hammer and four from a knife on Saturday evening close to the Eiffel Tower.The investigation is being handled by France anti-terror prosecutors who have launched a probe into a suspected “terrorist” plot.France’s top anti-terror prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said Sunday the man’s mother had reported concerns about him as recently as October, but there was insufficient proof at the time to take legal action.He had already been arrested in 2016 for planning an attack, eventually serving four years in prison and under close watch following his release.Darmanin said that the attacker’s mother had warned police that her son was no longer taking his medication and intelligence services had offered that he should be hospitalised. But she did not want that and then reported he was doing better.He said regional authorities currently did not have the power to issue an administrative order for such an individual to undergo psychiatric treatment and “this has to change”.Rajabpour-Miyandoab had been radicalised through contacts on the Internet rather than meeting people at a mosque, he emphasised, adding the attacker had also been in touch with perpetrators of similar past attacks.“Terrorism is changing and exploiting the weaknesses of our system,” said Darmanin."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/life-expectancy-in-the-us-ticks-up-but-remains-below-pre-pandemic-levels/,‘Failure’ in psychiatric care of Paris attacker: minister,1,"– Americans’ life expectancy rose in 2022 after two years of sharp decline, although it did not return to pre-pandemic levels, health officials said Wednesday.Life expectancy at birth in the United States rose by 1.1 years between 2021 and 2022, and stood at 77.5 years, according to initial estimates from the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC).“The increase… primarily resulted from decreases in mortality due to Covid-19,” the CDC said in a statement.However, the gain “does not fully offset the loss of 2.4 years of life expectancy between 2019 and 2021 that resulted mostly from increases in excess deaths due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” the agency said.Before Covid, Americans were expected to live to the age of 78.8.At the same time, the drop in mortality linked to Covid-19 last year was partly offset by an increase in mortality linked to flu or pneumonia, according to CDC.The gap in life expectancy between men and women narrowed slightly in 2022, to 5.4 years. Last year American women had a life expectancy of 80.2 years, compared to 74.8 for men.Native Americans had the lowest life expectancy in 2022 of 67.9 years, compared to 72.8 for Black people, 77.5 for whites, 80 for Hispanics, and 84.5 for Asians.In a separate report, the CDC said that the number of suicides continued to climb in 2022 and reached nearly 50,000 cases, or 14.3 deaths per 100,000 people, the highest since 1941, according to preliminary figures.The suicide rate has risen sharply in the United States since 2000, despite a slight decline in 2019 and 2020.Last year, the government relaunched the national suicide prevention hotline with a simple three-digit number, 988, to help for people in distress."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/australia-to-ban-vape-imports-over-child-addiction-concerns/,Life expectancy in the US ticks up,1,"Australia will ban imports of disposable vapes from January 1, the government said Tuesday, slamming the devices as recreational products addicting children.The block on single-use vapes is aimed at reversing a “disturbing” increase in vaping among young people, Health Minister Mark Butler said.Australia first revealed the import ban in May but had not given a start date until now.Vaping had been sold to governments as a tool to help long-term smokers quit, Butler said.“It was not sold as a recreational product, especially not one targeted to our kids, but that is what it has become,” the minister said.“The great majority of vapes contain nicotine, and children are becoming addicted.”About one in seven children aged 14-17 uses vapes, the government said in a statement.It cited “consistent evidence” that young Australians who vape are about three times more likely to take up tobacco smoking.Legislation will also be introduced in 2024 to outlaw the manufacture, advertising or supply of disposable vapes in Australia, the government said.The import ban was hailed by the Australian Medical Association.“Australia has been a world leader in reducing smoking rates and the subsequent health harms, so the government’s decisive action to stop vaping in its tracks and prevent further harm is very welcome,” said association president Steve Robson. The government said it was also introducing a scheme to enable doctors and nurses to prescribe vapes “where clinically appropriate” from January 1.Australia has a long record of fighting smoking.In 2012, it became the first country to introduce “plain packaging” laws for cigarettes — a policy since copied by France, Britain and others.High taxes have pushed up the price of a packet to about Aus$50 (US$33).For some people who would otherwise never have smoked, vaping is a “dangerous gateway” to tobacco, said Kim Caudwell, senior lecturer in psychology at Australia’s Charles Darwin University.“So you can understand how at the population level, increased vaping and a resurgence of tobacco use will impact population health in the future.”Neighbouring New Zealand until recently stood alongside Australia at the forefront of the battle against smoking.But its new conservative coalition government, which took power this week, has now promised to scrap a so-called “generational smoking ban” that would have stopped sales of tobacco to anyone born after 2008.“I was absolutely shocked and appalled. It is one of the worst days I can remember for public health,” University of Otago tobacco control expert Richard Edwards told AFP.“It is public health vandalism.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/uk-confirms-first-human-case-of-swine-flu-strain-h1n2/,but remains below pre-pandemic levels,1,"– UK public health officials on Monday said they had confirmed a first human case of a swine flu strain similar to one that has been circulating in pigs.The variant of the H1N2 virus was confirmed in an individual who had been tested by their doctor after experiencing respiratory symptoms.It has not previously been detected in humans in the country, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.“This is the first time we have detected this virus in humans in the UK, though it is very similar to viruses that have been detected in pigs,” said the agency’s incident director Meera Chand.“We are working rapidly to trace close contacts and reduce any potential spread.”The individual concerned experienced a mild illness and had fully recovered, the agency said in a statement.The source of their infection, however, was undetermined and is being investigated.UKHSA chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said veterinary and scientific knowledge is being provided to support its probe.Influenza A(H1) viruses are endemic in swine populations in most regions of the world.The H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 viruses are major subtypes of swine influenza A viruses in pigs.They occasionally infect humans, usually after direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments.The H1N1 pandemic in 2009 was the first major influenza outbreak in the 21st century.The official death toll of 18,500 was later revised upwards by The Lancet medical journal to between 151,700 and 575,400 dead."

At the children’s hospital of Beijing’s Capital Institute of Pediatrics on Thursday, AFP journalists saw crowds of parents and children dressed in winter clothes.A parent surnamed Zhang accompanied her coughing nine-year-old son and said he had fallen ill with mycoplasma pneumonia — a pathogen that can cause a sore throat, fatigue and fever.“There are really a lot of children who have caught it recently,” she said. “Of course that worries me!”Li Meiling, 42, had brought her eight-year-old daughter, who she said was suffering from the same type of pneumonia.“It’s true that a lot of children her age are ill with this at the moment,” she told AFP.But she also thought it was “normal that there are more cases of respiratory illnesses.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/ai-use-in-mozambique-jails-spawns-new-hope-in-tb-fight/,AI use in Mozambique jails spawns new hope in TB fight,1,"A programme using artificial intelligence to test inmates in a high security Mozambican jail for tuberculosis has spawned hope that the new tech can help eradicate the disease.Teeming prisons are a hotbed of TB, the world’s second deadliest communicable disease after Covid, according to the World Health Organization. Mozambique, a country of 32 million people, recorded about 120,000 infections last year.Caused by a bacteria that most often affects the lungs, it infected more than 10 million people in 2022 and killed 1.3 million, according to WHO.Almost one in four infections last year occurred in Africa.In the sprawling courtyard of the maximum security jail in the Mozambican capital Maputo, an inmate in an orange T-shirt stood before a tripod with a wide white tablet.Behind him, a doctor scoured a two-piece portable X-ray machine connected to an AI programme that has been hailed as a breakthrough in the fight against tuberculosis.“It processes it in real time, we have the results in less than five minutes,” the doctor said.The image popped on the computer of a technician sitting at a table outside a medical tent a few metres away, along with a diagnosis.“Radiological signs suggestive of tuberculosis — negative,” the message said.The programme is part of a large test run of the technology to scan all inmates at three prisons in Maputo. It is being conducted by a local non-profit organisation supported by the Stop TB Partnership, a UN-backed entity.Early diagnosis is key to save lives and tackle the spread of the disease.While a chronic cough is a hallmark of infection, people can also carry TB without showing symptoms. Prisons are a perfect breeding ground due to crammed cells and airborne transmission.Traditional spit, skin or blood tests for TB involves visits to a lab and the results can take up to three days. The quickest time for reliable results is 24 hours.– ‘Great leap in technology’ – The combination of AI and portable X-ray machines is faster and eliminates the need for visits to clinics and radiologists, who can be scarce in poor rural areas, said Stop TB’s deputy head Suvanand Sahu.“This is a great leap in technology,” he said.At the Maputo Provincial Penitentiary, prisoners testing positive are placed in isolation, locked in a quarantine room behind a rusty metal door.Inside, about a dozen inmates wearing face masks sit on mattresses thrown on the ground. Clothing, blankets and other belongings hang from a line strung between two discoloured blue pillars.Serious cases are taken to a medical ward.Mozambique’s jails were about 50 percent over capacity in 2022, according to the UN.“It’s not easy to see your friends playing and walking there but you have to accept that I am sick,” Kennet Fortune, an inmate who has spent 10 year behind bars for drug-related offences, said pointing at the trees in the prison yard.He is currently undergoing treatment and the process can take months. “When the time comes, I’ll be out,” he said.A WHO report this month found that global deaths from tuberculosis dipped in 2022, showing progress towards eradicating the disease.The UN health agency said 7.5 million people were diagnosed with TB in 2022 — the highest figure since it began monitoring in 1995.Sahu of Stop TB said he was hoping that the success of pilot programmes could help get funding to scale up the use of AI in diagnosing tuberculosis.“Only a few years ago, if I was to say in a meeting that we can bring X-rays to all communities and have them read by a artificial intelligence with no need for radiologists, they would have kicked me out of the room and told me to go write a sci-fi novel,” he said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-approves-first-vaccine-against-chikungunya-virus-drug-regulator/,US approves first vaccine against chikungunya virus: drug regulator,1,"US health authorities on Thursday approved the world’s first vaccine for chikungunya, a virus spread by infected mosquitoes that the Food and Drug Administration called “an emerging global health threat.”The vaccine, developed by Europe’s Valneva which will be marketed under the name Ixchiq, was approved for people 18 and over who are at increased risk of exposure, the FDA said.Ixchiq’s green-light by the US drug regulator is expected to speed the vaccine’s rollout in countries where the virus is most prevalent.Chikungunya, which causes fever and severe joint pain, is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, southeast Asia and part of the Americas.“However, chikungunya virus has spread to new geographical areas causing a rise in global prevalence of the disease,” the FDA said, reporting more than 5 million cases in the past 15 years.“Infection with chikungunya virus can lead to severe disease and prolonged health problems, particularly for older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions,” senior FDA official Peter Marks said in a statement.“Today’s approval addresses an unmet medical need and is an important advancement in the prevention of a potentially debilitating disease with limited treatment options.”The vaccine is injected in one dose and contains a live, weakened version of the chikungunya virus, as is standard with other vaccines.Two clinical trials were carried out in North America on 3,500 people. Headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, fever and nausea were commonly reported side effects.Serious reactions were reported in 1.6 percent of Ixchiq recipients in the trials, with two requiring hospitalization."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/rare-aid-delivery-reaches-al-shifa-hospital-in-gaza-city-un/,Rare aid delivery reaches Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City: UN,1,"A rare delivery of emergency medical supplies and medicines on Wednesday reached Al-Shifa hospital in the war-ravaged north of the Gaza Strip, the UN said, warning though that far more was needed.In a joint statement, the heads of the United Nations agency supporting Palestinian refugees and the World Health Organization said the aid had reached Gaza’s largest hospital “despite huge risks to our staff and health partners due to the relentless bombardments”.They highlighted that the delivery of life-saving supplies was only the second to reach the hospital, located in Gaza City, since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted over a month ago.“While welcome, the quantities we delivered are far from sufficient to respond to the immense needs in the Gaza Strip,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini and Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of WHO, wrote in the statement.They described conditions at the hospital as “disastrous”, with “almost two patients for every bed” as “the number of wounded increases by the hour”.Doctors were being forced to treat wounded and sick patients in corridors, on the floor and outdoors, “while patients are undergoing immense and unnecessary pain as medicines and anaesthetics are running out,” they said.At the same time, tens of thousands of displaced people had sought shelter in the hospital’s parking lots and yards.Israel’s siege and bombardment of Gaza began from October 7, when Hamas fighters massacred at least 1,400 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and took 240 hostages.Israel has responded with relentless bombardment and a swelling ground offensive in Gaza, killing nearly 10,600 people, including more than 4,000 children, according to the territory’s Hamas-controlled health ministry.More than 1.5 million people have fled their homes, including many heeding Israeli calls for the entire population of northern Gaza to go south.The Israeli army said 50,000 people left north Gaza for the south on Wednesday alone.Lazzarini and Tedros hailed doctors, nurses and other staff at Al-Shifa hospital for having “responded heroically to the current desperate situation”.“But they need more support. The northern areas of Gaza cannot and should not be isolated nor deprived of the delivery of humanitarian assistance,” they insisted.“Aid should reach the whole of Gaza.”They pointed out that Al-Shifa and other medical facilities were fast running out of supplies and especially fuel, which has not been allowed into Gaza since the fighting began.Lazzarini and Tedros urgently appealed for fuel deliveries to humanitarian agencies in Gaza.“Without fuel, hospitals and other essential facilities such as desalination plants and bakeries cannot operate, and more people will most certainly die as a result.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-officials-warn-of-dramatic-rise-in-infant-syphilis/,US officials warn of dramatic rise in infant syphilis,1,"Cases of syphilis among newborns have grown tenfold in the United States over the past 10 years, health officials warned Tuesday, part of a broader rise in sexually transmitted diseases in America.Over 3,700 infants were born with congenital syphilis in 2022, more than 10 times the number in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.However, in nine out of 10 cases the disease could have been prevented with timely testing and treatment during pregnancy, CDC said.“The congenital syphilis crisis in the United States has skyrocketed at a heartbreaking rate,” said CDC’s Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry.Infants can develop syphilis in utero, if their mother is infected and not treated. In a pregnant woman, syphilis can lead to miscarriages, death of the newborn, or long-term complications for the baby, such as loss of vision or hearing and bone malformations.“The STI epidemic in our country is continuing to escalate,” added Houry, in reference to sexually transmitted infections. “Syphilis is increasing in all age groups in the US, including women of reproductive age and their sexual partners.”Racial minorities bear the brunt of the epidemic with lower access to testing and treatment.Black, Native American or Hispanic babies were up to eight times more likely to be born with syphilis than babies born to white mothers in 2021, the agency said, calling for strategies tailored to the most vulnerable groups.Barriers experienced by them “include lack of ongoing health coverage, living in health care or maternal care deserts, transportation limitations, challenges posed by substance use disorder, housing instability, poverty and racism,” said Laura Bachmann, CDC’s top official on the prevention of socially transmitted diseases.The CDC called on health care providers to boost screening of pregnant women, including those treated in emergency rooms or in programs related to drug use."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/why-sweden-going-smoke-free-may-not-be-such-good-snus/,Why Sweden going smoke-free may not be such good ‘snus’,1,"GOTHENBURG, Sweden, Nov 7, 2023 (AFP) – Sweden is poised to become Europe’s first smoke-free country largely thanks to the popularity of snus, a kind of moist snuff which is placed under the upper lip.But some are worried the tobacco industry is peddling a “fairytale” that is too good to be true.Used by one in seven Swedes, snus has, according to the government, helped slash the number of smokers from 15 percent of the population in 2005 to 5.2 percent last year, a record low in Europe.A country is considered smoke-free when less than five percent of its population are daily smokers.Snus has been banned in the European Union since 1992. But Sweden negotiated an exemption when it joined the bloc three years later. At the Swedish Match factory in the western city of Gothenburg, thousands of doses of snus wend their way through a complex web of machinery producing the sachets.The company sold 277 million boxes of snus in Sweden and Norway in 2021.“We have used it for 200 years in Sweden. (It’s) part of the Swedish culture, just like many other European countries have their wine culture,” Swedish Match spokesman Patrik Hildingsson told AFP.Clad in a white lab coat, he described the manufacturing process.“Tobacco comes from India or the United States. It goes through this silo and is then packed inside the pouches like tea bags and then into these boxes.”There are two types: traditional brown snus, which contains tobacco, and white snus, which is made of synthetic nicotine and often flavoured. Traditional snus is mostly sold in Sweden, Norway and the US.White snus, introduced about 15 years ago, falls into a legal void in the EU since it doesn’t contain tobacco. It was banned this year in both Belgium and the Netherlands.But it is hugely popular with young people in Sweden, with its use quadrupling among women aged 16 to 29 in four years.Fifteen percent of people in Sweden say they use some form of snus daily, a figure that has risen slightly in recent years.At the same time, the country has seen a sharp drop in smokers even though cigarettes are less than half the price they are in Ireland.Just five percent of Swedes say they smoke regularly, according to 2022 data from the Public Health Agency, putting Sweden 27 years ahead of the EU’s 2050 smoke-free target.“It’s very positive,” Swedish Health Minister Jakob Forssmed told AFP.“A very important decision was the smoking ban in restaurants from 2005, and then at outdoor restaurants and public places in 2019,” he said.“Many Swedes also say that switching to snus helped them stop smoking.”The government has also backed the snus industry, hiking taxes recently on cigarettes by nine percent while cutting those on traditional snus by 20 percent.“With all these regulations it’s almost impossible to smoke. Snus doesn’t smell, and the nicotine rush is much stronger than with a cigarette,” said Thorbjorn Thoors, a 67-year-old window repairman who has used snus since his teens and quit smoking decades ago. But the decision to lower taxes on snus does not sit well with Ulrika Arehed Kagstrom, head of the Swedish Cancer Society.“It came as a complete surprise and I was really disappointed,” she said.“It shows that they really completely bought the fairytale from the tobacco industry, (which is) trying to find a new market for these products and saying that these are harm reduction products.“We don’t have enough research yet,” she insisted.“We know that snus and these kinds of nicotine products cause changes in your blood pressure and there is a risk of long-term cardiovascular disease.”Arehed Kagstrom fears that just like with smoking it will take years to show “to what extent these products were harmful”.A June 2023 study by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health showed that the risk of throat and pancreatic cancer was three and two times greater, respectively, among frequent snus users.However, in 2017, a study in the International Journal of Cance concluded there was no link between cancer and snus."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/climate-change-and-filthy-water-drive-disease-in-iraq/,Climate change and filthy water drive disease in Iraq,1,"AL-AYYACH, Iraq, Oct 25, 2023 (AFP) – A worried Iraqi father points at a blister on the face of his one-year-old daughter, the result of a parasitic infection carried by sandflies in her remote village.“It’s a skin disease, the ‘Baghdad boil’,” Najeh Farhan said of the pustule on Tiba’s mouth as the toddler played with a pacifier at their home in the drought-hit province of Al-Diwaniyah.Like countless other children in Iraq — a country battling the effects of war, entrenched poverty, water stress and a heating planet — Tiba is sick but has no access to good health care.“There is no medical centre, we have nothing,” Farhan, a father of seven, said of his small village of Al-Zuweiya.Tiba has been infected with an illness called cutaneous leishmaniasis, endemic in Iraq for decades.By 2022, the World Health Organization said 8,000 infections had been registered in the country.But this year, in a “surprising development”, it reported the first confirmed case in what had been a “traditionally sand fly-free” province in northern Iraq.The UN agency has pointed to “inadequate access to medical treatment in remote areas” as a driver of the disease — but a senior WHO official also highlighted the effects of climate change.“The sandfly, like any other insect, thrives at a specific temperature and humidity level,” Wael Hatahit, the WHO’s acting representative in Iraq, told AFP.He pointed to Iraq’s “temperature rise and the change in the water fall pattern” and said the northward spread of the disease the sandfly carries “cannot be explained unless there is climate change”.– ‘Rising temperatures’ – Tiba and one of her brothers, who suffers from jaundice and a skin rash, are victims of Iraq’s broader public health crisis.From cholera to chronic diarrhoea and sandstorm-triggered asthma attacks, the list of health problems confronting disadvantaged communities is long.The Iraqi Red Crescent has been running a campaign in nine provinces across the country’s south and centre where soaring heat and drought have badly hit farming communities.It has sent 25 doctors, 150 volunteers, five mobile clinics and 10 ambulances on a campaign to provide free medical care and raise awareness on a range of health threats.On a recent stop, women dressed in black were waiting alongside ambulances to have a child examined, in Al-Ayyach, another Diwaniyah village, as aid workers sorted through their medical supplies.Raghda Ihsane, a pharmacist, listed the most common cases the team was treating: “Intestinal infections, dermatological diseases, skin rashes resulting from poor water quality, inflamed urinary tracts.”Dirty and unsafe water is a prime health threat in Iraq, one of the five countries worst hit by climate change impacts and now gripped by its fourth consecutive year of drought.The scarcity is compounded by reduced Tigris and Euphrates river flows because of upstream dams, and damage done by conflict and neglect to treatment plans and water infrastructure. An environment ministry official recently admitted that “sewer pipes in Baghdad discharge wastewater directly into the Tigris River”, in comments quoted by the state-run Al-Sabbah daily.Cholera is raging in the north, particularly in Sulaimaniyah, Iraqi Kurdistan’s second city, where the WHO had registered 152 confirmed cases by September 12.“The principal cause is the use of non-potable water,” said Sabah Hourami, director of Sulaimaniyah’s health authority.Officials were taking action, he insisted, by testing the chlorine content of public water supplies and tightening controls on water tankers, restaurants and mosques.As patients have flocked to local hospitals, he said, “we no longer screen people. Those suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting are automatically treated as cholera cases.”Water stress is at the core of the health threats, said medical anthropologist Mac Skelton, who heads the Institute of Regional and International Studies at the American University of Iraq-Sulaimani.“Decreased water flow means higher concentrations of sewage and industrial pollutants in the water supply, which Iraq’s water treatment facilities typically cannot process adequately,” he said.This, he said, was “associated with a range of conditions such as cholera, gastrointestinal diseases, skin diseases and diarrhoea”.Looking ahead, Skelton said, Iraq needs “improved public health systems to warn the populace of heightened contamination and to monitor outbreaks”.He added that “enhancing Iraq’s seriously deteriorated water treatment infrastructure is also essential”."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/meta-sued-over-child-mental-health-concerns/,US states accuse Meta of profiting ‘from children’s pain’,1,"By Glenn CHAPMANSAN FRANCISCO, Oct 24, 2023 (AFP) – Dozens of US states on Tuesday accused Facebook and Instagram owner Meta of profiting “from children’s pain,” damaging their mental health and misleading people about the safety of its platforms.“In seeking to maximize its financial gains, Meta has repeatedly misled the public about the substantial dangers of its Social Media Platforms,” argued a joint lawsuit filed in federal court in California.In total more than 40 states are suing Meta, though some opted to file in local courts rather than join in the federal case.Meta has exploited young users by creating a business model designed to maximize time they spend on the platform despite harm to their health, the legal filing argued.“Kids and teenagers are suffering from record levels of poor mental health and social media companies like Meta are to blame,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James in a statement announcing the suit.“Meta has profited from children’s pain by intentionally designing its platforms with manipulative features that make children addicted to their platforms while lowering their self-esteem.”The suit accuses Meta of deceptive and unlawful conduct harming vulnerable youth for financial gain.The suit urges the federal court to order Meta to stop manipulative tactics and pay hefty financial penalties along with restitution, according to James.“Social media companies, including Meta, have contributed to a national youth mental health crisis and they must be held accountable,” James said.Meta said it was “disappointed” by the suit and that the states were not working with the array of social media companies to create age-appropriate standards.Meta maintained that it has developed more than 30 tools in its apps to support teenage users, and made it easier for parents to “shape” online activity.The Silicon Valley tech firm contended it is disappointing that attorneys general have singled out Meta instead of seeking industry-wide solutions given the popularity of rivals including TikTok, YouTube and Snap.Social media can also be a place where young people struggling with other issues in their lives go to find support of community, Meta maintained.The legal complaints resulted from a nationwide investigation announced in November of 2021, according to California attorney general Rob Bonta.“Our bipartisan investigation has arrived at a solemn conclusion: Meta has been harming our children and teens, cultivating addiction to boost corporate profits,” Bonta said in a release.“With today’s lawsuit, we are drawing the line.”The investigation was launched after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked more than 20,000 pages of internal documents to the media that sparked criticism that the social media giant had put profit before the security of its users.During testimony to American and European lawmakers in 2021, she insisted that Facebook failed to curtail toxic content and that the company cannot be trusted to change its ways.Facebook later that year changed its name to Meta in a move critics suspected was intended to distance the company from its social networking controversies.Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg defended the company at the time, saying that “the argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/bird-flu-detected-in-antarctica-region-for-first-time/,Bird flu detected in Antarctica region for first time,1,"PARIS, Oct 24, 2023 (AFP) – Bird flu has been detected in the Antarctica region for the first time, according to British experts, raising concerns the deadly virus could pose a threat to penguins and other local species.Scientists had been fearing that the worst outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in history would reach Antarctica, a key breeding ground for many birds.The British Antarctic Survey said its staff took samples from brown skua seabirds after they died on Bird Island in South Georgia, a British overseas territory east of South America’s tip and north of Antarctica’s main landmass.The tests were sent to Britain and came back positive, the UK’s polar research institute said in a statement on Monday.The virus was most likely brought by birds returning from their migration to South America, where there has been a huge number of bird flu cases, it added.Visitors to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are under enhanced biosecurity measures, and scientific field work involving birds there has been stopped, the statement said.There have been regular bird flu outbreaks since the virus first emerged in 1996.Since mid-2021, much larger outbreaks started to spread southward to previously untouched areas including South America, leading to mass deaths among wild birds and tens of millions of poultry being culled.Michelle Wille, a bird flu expert at the University of Melbourne, said the spread of bird flu to the Antarctica region was “devastating news”.“The situation could change rapidly,” she wrote on X, formerly Twitter.Ian Brown, virology head at the UK’s Animal and Plant Health Agency, warned last week that there was a risk migrating birds could spread the virus from South America to the Antarctica islands and then onto the main landmass.This could be a “real concern” for populations of birds such as penguins that are unique to Antarctica, he told journalists.Birds such as penguins that have never before been exposed to the virus would have no prior immunity, potentially making them more vulnerable.In better news, the Animal Plant Health Agency also said last week that preliminary research had confirmed that the populations of two seabirds — northern gannets and shag — had shown immunity to bird flu.Humans rarely catch bird flu, but when they do it is usually via direct contact with infected birds.Earlier this month, a two-year-old girl died from bird flu in Cambodia, the third death recorded in the country this year.The virus has also been detected in a growing number of mammals, raising fears it could mutate into a version that is more transmissible between humans.dl/js"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/philippines-health-insurer-hacked-what-we-know/,Philippines health insurer hacked: What we know,1,"MANILA, Oct 9, 2023 (AFP) – Hackers have stolen the personal data of potentially millions of people from the Philippines’s national health insurer, which has urged members to change their passwords after the “staggering” cyberattack.The hackers have started releasing files including confidential memos from the stolen data to pressure the government into paying a $300,000 ransom.Here is what we know so far about the attack, which was discovered by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) on September 22:What did the hackers steal? PhilHealth and the government have yet to say exactly how many people have been impacted, but the insurer warned members in a notice that data such as addresses, phone numbers and insurance IDs was compromised.As of June 30, according to its website, PhilHealth had more than 59 million direct and indirect contributors — more than half the population of the Philippines.PhilHealth asked members to monitor credit card transactions and change passwords, especially for financial services.Separately, employee information was also stolen from the targeted computers.The hackers released some of the data on the dark web, showing health memos and other information that a top government official described as confidential.An investigation into the scale of the attack is ongoing, but the National Privacy Commission has described the amount of data stolen as “staggering”.Who are the hackers, and what do they want? The Philippine government has referred to the attackers as the Medusa group, who have demanded $300,000 to restore access to PhilHealth computers and delete the stolen data.MedusaLocker, first detected in late 2019, has been used to mainly target healthcare organisations and its creators took particular advantage of the emergency situation during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a US government report.The ransomware has been sold to criminal actors, and a US government cybersecurity advisory said its creator receives a cut of any ransom.It was not clear if the Medusa group identified by the Philippines government is the creator of or an entity that purchased MedusaLocker.How did they get the data? On September 22, PhilHealth staff were unable to access a number of computers, which displayed a message saying hackers had locked the machines and encrypted the data.The insurer shut down the affected systems to try and stop the attack from spreading, slowing or entirely shutting down some online services for days.The government has so far not said exactly how hackers got access to the computers.But in interviews with local media last week, senior PhilHealth official Israel Pargas said the insurer did not have an antivirus software at the time of the attack.How has the government responded? With a blunt ‘No’. The Philippines does not pay ransom in any criminal cases, including cyberattacks, officials have said.However, with hackers releasing more data from the stolen files, calls have grown for the government to conduct an audit of its cyber defences.The National Privacy Commission said Saturday it has started an investigation into any potential lapses and data law violations by PhilHealth.The NPC said its analysis of 734 GB of stolen data revealed “sensitive personal data”, and warned the public that anyone who downloads this information could face criminal charges."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/popular-weight-loss-drugs-linked-to-higher-risk-of-stomach-paralysis-pancreatitis-bowel-obstruction/,Popular weight loss drugs linked to higher risk of stomach paralysis,1,"WASHINGTON, Oct 5, 2023 (AFP) – Drugs like Ozempic, which have become increasingly popular for losing weight, heighten the risk of certain severe gastrointestinal problems including stomach paralysis, according to a large study published Thursday.The paper, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), looked at a class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists that includes the brands Wegovy, Ozempic, Rybelsus and Saxenda.It then compared the rate of serious side effects to another class of weight loss drug, bupropion-naltrexone.The GLP-1 agonists were associated with an almost four times increased risk of stomach paralysis, a nine times higher risk of pancreatitis and four times greater risk of bowel obstruction.These conditions can cause hospitalization and require surgery, depending on their severity.“Given the wide use of these drugs, these adverse events, although rare, must be considered by patients thinking about using them for weight loss,” said lead author Mohit Sodhi, a medical student at the University of British Columbia in Canada, in a statement.“The risk calculus will differ depending on whether a patient is using these drugs for diabetes, obesity or just general weight loss,” he added. “People who are otherwise healthy may be less willing to accept these potentially serious adverse events.”Originally developed for managing Type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 agonists have soared in popularity in recent years as a means to lose weight, mainly through “off-label” use.Saxenda and Wegovy were approved for weight loss in 2020 and 2021, but the clinical trials used to greenlight them involved too few people with too short a follow-up time to detect very rare events, the researchers said.Epidemiologist and co-author Mahyar Etminan said that while there had been anecdotal reports of some patients using these drugs for weight loss and then having repeated episodes of nausea and vomiting as a result of stomach paralysis, the current study was the first to examine the question at a larger scale.The authors trawled through US patient records searching for people prescribed liraglutide or semaglutide — the two main GLP-1 agonists — or bupropion/naltrexone, a non GLP-1 weight loss medication, to see how many went on to develop certain gastrointestinal conditions.Their analysis included patients with a recent history of obesity, but excluded those with diabetes or who had been prescribed another antidiabetic drug. Just over 5,400 records were included in the final analysis.“The results from this study highlight how important it is that patients access these drugs only through trusted medical professionals, and only with ongoing support and monitoring,” said Simon Cork, a senior lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University, who was not involved in the research.“It is vital that regulation is tightened to ensure that these drugs are only prescribed under the right circumstances.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/un-one-in-10-babies-worldwide-born-preterm-with-risks-of-complications/,pancreatitis,1,"Every year, millions of babies are born prematurely. In 2020, an estimated 13.4 million babies were born early, with nearly one million dying from preterm complications.This is equivalent to around 1 in 10 babies born worldwide, UN agencies and partners said in a new report on Thursday.The highest rates of preterm birth occur in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, where over 13% of babies are born preterm.The rates in the worst affected countries are three or four times higher than those in the least affected countries.“Preterm babies are especially vulnerable to life-threatening health complications, and they need special care and attention,” said Dr. Anshu Banerjee, Director of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing at WHO.Preterm birth is not just an issue in low and middle-income countries. It affects families in all parts of the world, including high-income countries.Rates of 10 per cent or higher occur in some high-income countries such as Greece and the United States of America.“These numbers show an urgent need for serious investment in services available to support them and their families as well as a greater focus on prevention – in particular, ensuring access to quality health care before and during every pregnancy,” Dr. Banerjee said.Maternal health risks, such as adolescent pregnancy, infections, poor nutrition, and pre-eclampsia, are closely linked to preterm births. Quality antenatal care is critical to detect and manage these complications.The authors of the report call for continued commitment to strengthen data availability and quality, as well as data sharing so that appropriate support and action can be targeted where needed most."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/climate-change-worsens-bangladesh-dengue-outbreak-with-record-deaths/,Climate change worsens Bangladesh dengue outbreak,1,"By Shafiqul ALAMDHAKA, Oct 5, 2023 (AFP) – In the crowded fever ward in Bangladesh’s Mugda hospital, every bed is taken, as the country struggles in the grip of its deadliest dengue outbreak.More than 1,000 people have died this year in the nation’s worst recorded spate of the mosquito-borne disease, which scientists say is increasing in frequency due to climate change.In the worst cases, intense viral fevers trigger bleeding, internally or from the mouth and nose.Nupur Akter, 21, is struggling desperately to feed her sister Payel, who she rushed into hospital two weeks ago while the six-year-old was “shaking uncontrollably”.But there has been little improvement. “She has become weaker,” Akter said.The Mugda Medical College and Hospital in the capital Dhaka is a key battleground against the outbreak, with the flood-prone South Asian nation a fertile ground for mosquitoes that breed in stagnant water.A record 1,030 people have died nationwide this year, with more than 210,000 cases confirmed by hospitals. The figures dwarf the previous record last year, when 281 died.Hospital director Mohammad Niamatuzzaman said medics were in non-stop crisis mode, bringing in gynaecology, heart and kidney specialists to aid overwhelmed general medics.“It’s an emergency — but a long-lasting one,” Niamatuzzaman told AFP, adding the state-run centre recorded 158 dengue deaths this year, five times its toll last year.Three floors of the 10-storey hospital have been set aside for dengue, supporting more than 200 patients.Overall, the 400-bed hospital is treating nearly 1,000 patients, and thousands more as outpatients.Mohammad Sabuj, a goldsmith and father of three sons from the Konapara suburb of Dhaka, said there was someone with dengue in “almost every home” in his neighbourhood.“In my shop, three out of four workers got the fever,” said the 40-year-old, who was recovering after he too was rushed to hospital.Sabuj said his friend, who was a doctor, had died.“When a doctor couldn’t save himself, it scares me,” he said. “God forbid, if something happens to me at this age, where my family and children will go?”Hospital treatment is free, but families have to buy many of the medicines, or pay for costly private blood tests to bypass the backlog.Abdul Hakim, whose job as a construction worker provides his family’s only income, is watching over his two-year-old son at the clinic.“Since the day my son got a fever, I have no work,” said Hakim, 38, who has two children.“I am managing the tests, medicines and other hospital expenses by taking a loan… just to get him well”.At Mugda hospital, a quarter of the dengue patients are children. Overall, children under 15 make up roughly 10 percent of the dead. Bangladesh has recorded cases of dengue since the 1960s but documented its first outbreak of dengue haemorrhagic fever, a severe and sometimes fatal form of the disease, in 2000.The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that dengue — and other diseases caused by mosquito-borne viruses such as chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika — are spreading faster and further due to climate change.About half of the world’s population is now at risk of dengue, with an estimated 100 to 400 million infections occurring each year, and many of those causing only mild illness, according to WHO.The Aedes mosquito that spreads dengue — identifiable by its black and white stripy legs — breeds in stagnant pools, and cases have slowed as the monsoon rains fade.But experts warn the threat remains because in the hotter and dryer months, people store water in containers.Niamatuzzaman said he believed deaths had soared because many patients had been infected multiple times. Those with repeat infections are at greater risk of complications.While previous dengue outbreaks were largely confined to cities, Niamatuzzaman said patients are now coming from rural areas across the country where dengue had not been reported before.“In my lifetime, I have rarely heard the name of this disease,” said 65-year-old Alep Kari.He came to Mugda hospital after he and his wife fell sick with dengue, and clinics in his rural district of Shariatpur were already full.“This is the first time we got this fever in my village,” he said. “Many were infected.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/france-to-hold-crisis-meetings-on-bedbug-scourge/,with record deaths,1,"By Sami ACEF with David COURBET in MarseillePARIS, Oct 3, 2023 (AFP) – The French government said Tuesday it would host emergency meetings this week to examine surging numbers of reported bedbug cases, which are being increasingly seen as a major potential public health problem.Bedbugs have in recent weeks gone from being a subject of potential derision to a contentious political issue in France, with aghast citizens reporting seeing the creatures in locations including trains, the Paris metro and cinemas.The concerns have gained added weight with France in the throes of hosting the Rugby World Cup and Paris preparing to welcome athletes and fans from around the world for the 2024 Olympics.Two schools — one in Marseille and the other in Villefranche-sur-Saone outside Lyon in southeastern France — have become infected with bedbugs and have been closed down for several days to be cleaned out, local authorities said.The aim of a meeting on Wednesday, which will see Transport Minister Clement Beaune host transport and passenger organisations, will be to “quantify the situation and strengthen the measures”, his ministry said.“We want to inform on the actions undertaken and act in the service of travellers to reassure and protect,” the ministry said.An inter-ministerial meeting will then take place on Friday, government spokesman Olivier Veran told RTL TV, promising to “rapidly bring answers for the French”.Meanwhile, the head of President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party in the French National Assembly, Sylvain Maillard, said a cross-party bill would be put forward “at the beginning of December” to combat the “scourge” of bedbugs.He said the president’s party and its allies had decided to make the subject a “priority” and urged the right-wing and hard-left opposition to come up with suggestions for a cross-party text.Health Minister Aurelien Rousseau insisted on France Inter radio there was no “general panic” over the issue.“What concerns me is that people do not get cheated by firms that make them pay 2,000 or 3,000 euros ($2,100 or $3,100)” to rid their houses of bedbugs, he added, denouncing “abuses” in the pest control sector.Bedbugs, which had largely disappeared from daily life by the 1950s, have made a resurgence in recent decades, mostly due to high population densities and more mass transit.One-tenth of all French households are believed to have had a bedbug problem over the past few years, usually requiring a pest control operation costing several hundreds of euros that often needs to be repeated.The blood-sucking insects have been spotted in the Paris metro, high-speed trains and at Paris’s Charles De Gaulle Airport.But the individual cases have not been confirmed by the authorities and RMC TV reported that a probe by Paris transport operator RATP had found no bedbugs on its services.Renaissance MP Bruno Studer said that a priority for the future would be counting the number of bedbugs.“We do not know today if there are more bedbugs than in 2019,” he said.In addition to the development of statistical tools, the text could make it possible to recognise the problem as “a question of public health,” said his colleague Robin Reda.“We have wasted six years. The government has done nothing,” said the head of the group of hard-left France Unbowed MPs Mathilde Panot, adding the “urgency is to act now” with a national prevention plan, an emergency fund and the creation of public disinfestation services.Bedbugs get their name from their habit of nesting in mattresses, although they can also hide in clothes and in luggage.They come out at night to feed on human blood.Bedbug bites leave red areas, blisters or large rashes on the skin, and can cause intense itching or allergic reactions.They also often cause psychological distress, sleeping issues, anxiety and depression."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/nobel-winning-mrna-pioneer-weissman-now-wants-to-defeat-covid-forever/,France to hold crisis meetings on bedbug ‘scourge’,1,"WASHINGTON, Oct 2, 2023 (AFP) – From developing a one-and-done coronavirus shot to overcoming misinformation and global vaccine inequity, Nobel prize winner Drew Weissman says that at 64, he’s only “speeding up.”The University of Pennsylvania immunologist was awarded the biggest accolade in medicine on Monday for his pioneering research on messenger RNA, the technology behind Covid-19 vaccines that changed the course of the pandemic.“What happened is I got a cryptic text from Kati around four in the morning,” he said in an interview with AFP, referring to his old friend, collaborator and Nobel co-winner Katalin Kariko.She had received word from the Nobel committee that they had finally won after being passed over the past couple of years — but they weren’t sure it was real until the official announcement.“We were wondering if somebody was pulling a prank on us!” he said.The honors have been piling up for Weissman: the Lasker Award, the Breakthrough Prize, and many more — though he says the Nobel was always the “ultimate,” something he had dreamed of since the age of five, when he first became interested in how things work.Having just turned 64, and helped the world tame a virus that killed an estimated seven million worldwide, he could be forgiven for considering a well-earned retirement.But Weissman says there’s too much work left to be done. “I’m speeding up and my wife and family aren’t happy about it,” he joked. “I’m in a good spot.”– ‘Ultimate’ vaccine – First on his quest: how to improve upon Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, which have saved countless lives by protecting incredibly well against severe disease and death.Weissman says the next step in their evolution is universal shots that will be far better than the annualized boosters currently on offer.A “pan-coronavirus” vaccine he is working on with an international team “should cover all future variants — and any bat coronaviruses that might cross over into people,” he said.Though coronaviruses are known to mutate fast, Weissman teamed with AI specialists to comb through their structures, which contain roughly 30,000 “nucleotides” or building blocks, in search of “conserved regions” that stay the same.They have shown it works in animals, and now hope to begin human trials within the next six months. “We think that’s going to be the ultimate vaccine,” he said.In all, his lab is developing 20 different mRNA vaccines, with seven already in human trials, protecting against everything from rare autoimmune disorders to food allergies and heart disease.“We’ve really expanded our scope of research — and that’s been allowed because the world… now recognizes RNA as important,” he said.It’s a far cry from Weissman’s anonymity during the 1990s and 2000s when he and Kariko made their key discoveries about how mRNA could be harnessed.Unlike traditional vaccines, messenger RNA vaccines deliver genetic instructions to turn some of the host’s cells into virus-like particles, training the immune system for when it encounters the real deal.– Misinformation and equity – Of course, scientific advances need to reach people to make a difference, and to this end Weissman is part of a group working to tackle hesitancy at the global level.“There’s one group who refuse to take the vaccine no matter what — they follow politicians who submit laws to try to make RNA vaccines illegal in the United States,” said Weissman, referring to a Republican-backed bill in Idaho.But those on the fence — including conservatives, African Americans, the elderly and others — may respond to targeted messaging that’ll resonate, he added.He’s also involved in setting up production sites in low and middle-income nations, with the first, in Thailand, developing dengue and tularemia vaccines.It’s “an incredibly important thing to give access to RNA technology to every part of the world,” he said. “Pfizer and Moderna aren’t going to have a big interest in making a vaccine for tularemia,” a rare but serious zoonotic disease that is virtually absent in developed countries.“But if they’ve got production sites and researchers locally, who want to do it, then they’ve got everything they need.”"

World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in September that the outbreak was “putting huge pressure on the health system” in Bangladesh.The agency’s alert and response director Abdi Mahamud said the same month that such outbreaks were a “canary in the coal mine of the climate crisis”.He said that a combination of factors including climate change and this year’s El Nino warming weather pattern had contributed to severe dengue outbreaks in several areas including Bangladesh and South America.Countries in sub-Saharan Africa such as Chad have also recently reported outbreaks, he added."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/anti-covid-drug-may-have-led-to-virus-mutations-study/,Recent winners of the Nobel Medicine Prize,1,"An anti-Covid drug widely used across the world may have caused mutations in the virus, researchers said on Monday, but there was no evidence that the changes had led to more dangerous variants.Pharmaceutical giant Merck’s antiviral pill molnupiravir was one of the earliest treatments rolled out during the pandemic to prevent Covid becoming more severe in vulnerable people.The drug, which is taken orally over a five-day course, works mainly by creating mutations in the virus with the goal of weakening and killing it.However, a new UK-led study has shown that molnupiravir “can give rise to significantly mutated viruses which remain viable,” lead author Theo Sanderson told AFP.Sanderson, a geneticist at London’s Francis Crick Institute, emphasised that there is no evidence that “molnupiravir has to date created more transmissible or more virulent viruses.”None of the variants that have swept the world were due to the drug, he added.But “it is very difficult to predict whether molnupiravir treatment could potentially lead to a new widely circulating variant which people don’t have prior immunity to,” he added. For the study, which was published in the journal Nature, the researchers sifted through databases of more than 15 million genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the Covid disease.The researchers used this data to track changes in how the virus mutated during the pandemic, finding signs of a particular “mutational signature” in patients they believe is linked to molnupiravir.In 2022, as the drug was prescribed in huge numbers, there was a significant increase in patients who had this mutational signature, the study found.This signature was more commonly found in countries where the drug was widely prescribed, such as the United States, UK, Australia and Japan.But in countries where it was not approved, including Canada and France, it was rarer.Merck refuted the study, saying the researchers had relied on “circumstantial associations” between where and when the sequences were taken.“The authors assume these mutations were associated with viral spread from molnupiravir-treated patients without documented evidence of that transmission,” Merck said in a statement sent to AFP.Sanderson rebuffed this claim, saying the researchers had used “several independent lines of evidence to identify with confidence that molnupiravir drives this mutational signature”.That included a separate analysis of treatment data in England, which found that more than 30 percent of mutation events involving the signature were in people who had taken molnupiravir.However, just 0.04 percent of people in England were prescribed the drug in 2022, the study said.Other anti-Covid drugs do not work in the same manner, so would not cause these kinds of mutations, Sanderson said. Experts not involved in the study seemed to side with the British researchers.Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the UK’s University of Leeds, said it was an “incredibly important, well-conducted piece of research”.Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, said the research showed a “strong link” between molnupiravir and the occasional, limited spread of highly mutated genomes.“What isn’t clear is if any of the transmitted viruses contained mutations which would change how they would behave — for example if they were more or less transmissible, more pathogenic or less susceptible to our immunity,” he added.The experts emphasised that molnupiravir is not dangerous to people who are currently taking the drug.They also did not call for the drug to be abandoned altogether.Molnupiravir is already being used by itself “less and less” as its effectiveness had waned against vaccinated people who are not at risk, Griffin said.While the existing research might suggest that molnupiravir should no longer be prescribed by itself, “it shouldn’t be discarded and could still be valuable if we were to use it in drug combinations,” he added.Sales of molnupiravir, sold under the brand name Lagevrio, topped $20 billion last year. However sales fell 82 percent in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period last year, according to Merck."

But H5N1 is increasingly infecting mammals worldwide, from sea lions in Argentina to foxes in Finland, raising fears it could pass on more easily to humans.The virus has typically been confined to seasonal outbreaks, but since 2021 cases have emerged year-round, and across the globe, leading to what experts say is the largest outbreak ever seen.SAPA said the number of avian flu cases in South Africa this year was higher than in any year since the first outbreaks were reported in commercial farms in 2017."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/air-pollution-from-fires-hits-worlds-poorest-hardest-study/,cancer tipped as Medicine Prize opens Nobel week,1,"People in poorer countries are disproportionately suffering from air pollution spewed from the increasing scourge of fires in forests and fields around the world, according to new research published Wednesday.Landscape fires include blazes in forests, shrub, grass, pastures and agricultural lands, whether planned or uncontrolled such as the wildfires that have ravaged countries including Algeria, Canada and Greece this year.They generate smoke that can travel up to thousands of kilometres, creating public health risks, including increases in mortality and worsening of heart and lung-related illnesses.Ambient air pollution caused some 4.5 million deaths in 2019, according to a study published in Lancet Planetary Health last year.In a new study published in the journal Nature, researchers used data, machine learning and modelling to estimate global daily quantities of fine particles called PM2.5 and surface ozone concentrations emitted by landscape fires between 2000 and 2019.The annual air pollution from landscape fires in low-income countries was around four times higher than in rich nations, they found, with central Africa, Southeast Asia, South America and Siberia experiencing the highest levels.Increasing temperatures linked to human-caused climate change are increasing the risk of fire.Shandy Li, an associate professor at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia who co-authored the study, said warming meant that the pollution “phenomena might be worse in the future”.“Available evidence shows that fire smoke could increase health risks including mortality and morbidity, which means people should pay attention to reduce exposure to fire air pollution,” she told AFP.Some 2.18 billion people a year on average were exposed to at least one day of “substantial” air pollution coming from landscape fire sources between 2010 and 2019, an increase of almost seven percent on the previous decade.That includes daily average PM2.5 levels above 2021 WHO guidelines of 15 micrograms per cubic metre of air, where pollution from fire sources accounts for at least half of the total.Africa had the highest average number of days of exposure to “substantial” fire-derived air pollution per person every year at 32.5, followed by South America at 23.1.In contrast, Europeans were exposed to around one day of substantial pollution per year on average during the decade.The five countries with the highest average annual number of days of exposure to substantial fire-sourced pollution per person were all African: Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, Congo-Brazzaville and Gabon. In a separate study also published in Nature on Wednesday, scientists said wildfire smoke in the United States had eroded air quality progress achieved over decades.Cities in rich countries also battle with poor air quality that breaches WHO guidelines, mostly due to pollution linked to transport, heating and industry.Earlier this month, the UN World Meteorological Organization said climate change was driving more intense and frequent heatwaves and a subsequent “witch’s brew” of pollution.Reducing extreme weather events by mitigating climate change would help limit the risk, Li said.The researchers said their findings provided further evidence of “climate injustice” as those least responsible for human-induced climate change suffered the most from wildfires made more intense and frequent by it.Changes to land management techniques, notably the burning of agricultural waste or blazes started deliberately to convert wildland for agricultural or commercial purposes, could also help reduce the extent of fires, they added."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/indias-nipah-virus-outbreak-what-do-we-know-so-far/,S.African chickens hit by ‘worst’ bird flu outbreak,1,"– Authorities in India are scrambling to contain a rare outbreak of Nipah, a virus spread from animals to humans that causes deadly fever with a high mortality rate.Here is a look at what we know so far:The first Nipah outbreak was recorded in 1998 after the virus spread among pig farmers in Malaysia.The virus is named after the village where it was discovered.Outbreaks are rare but Nipah has been listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) — alongside Ebola, Zika and Covid-19 — as one of several diseases deserving of priority research for their potential to cause a global epidemic.Nipah usually spreads to humans from animals or through contaminated food, but it can also be transmitted directly between people.Fruit bats are the natural carriers of the virus and have been identified as the most likely cause of subsequent outbreaks.Symptoms include intense fever, vomiting and a respiratory infection, but severe cases can involve seizures and brain inflammation that results in a coma.Patients have a mortality rate of between 40 and 75 percent depending on the public health response to the virus, the WHO says.The first Nipah outbreak killed more than 100 people in Malaysia and prompted the culling of one million pigs in an effort to contain the virus.It also spread to Singapore, with 11 cases and one death among slaughterhouse workers who came into contact with pigs imported from Malaysia.Since then, the disease has mainly been recorded in Bangladesh and India, with both countries reporting their first outbreaks in 2001.Bangladesh has borne the brunt in recent years, with more than 100 people dying of Nipah since 2001.Two early outbreaks in India killed more than 50 people before they were brought under control.The southern state of Kerala has recorded two deaths from Nipah and four other confirmed cases since last month.Authorities there have closed some schools and instituted mass testing.This marks Kerala’s fourth recorded spate of Nipah cases in five years. The virus killed 17 people during the first instance in 2018.The state has managed to stamp out previous outbreaks within a matter of weeks through widespread testing and strict isolation of those in contact with patients.Having first appeared thousands of years ago, zoonoses — diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans — have multiplied over the past 20 to 30 years.The growth of international travel has allowed them to spread more quickly.By occupying increasingly large areas of the planet, experts say, humans also contribute to disruption of the ecosystem and increase the likelihood of random virus mutations that are transmissible to humans.Industrial farming increases the risk of pathogens spreading between animals while deforestation heightens contact between wildlife, domestic animals and humans.By mixing more, species will transmit their viruses more, which will promote the emergence of new diseases potentially transmissible to humans.Climate change will push many animals to flee their ecosystems for more livable lands, a study published by the scientific journal Nature warned in 2022.According to estimates published in the journal Science in 2018, there are 1.7 million unknown viruses in mammals and birds, 540,000-850,000 of them with the capacity to infect humans."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/immunologist-wins-breakthrough-prize-for-innovative-cancer-treatment/,Air pollution from fires hits world’s poorest hardest: study,1,"When Michel Sadelain began his decades-long quest to genetically modify immune cells to fight cancer, his peers dismissed his ideas as absurd and even his mother grew concerned for his career.On Thursday, the French and Canadian scientist was announced as a winner of the prestigious Breakthrough Prize for his pioneering work in CAR T-cell therapy, a new form of treatment that has shown exceptional efficacy against blood cancers.“Over the years, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard this won’t work, can’t work, even if it works it has no future,” the 63-year-old told AFP in an interview.He was passed up for grants, promotions became uncertain, and graduate students steered clear of joining his lab.“One thing I have to do is to throw a big party with all those who contributed,” Sadelain said, laughing. He will split $3 million with American immunologist Carl June, who also led groundbreaking research into the field independently of his co-winner.The Breakthrough Prize awards “the world’s most brilliant minds” in fields including life sciences, fundamental physics and mathematics, styling itself as the Silicon Valley-backed answer to the Nobels. Founding sponsors include Sergey Brin, Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg. Sadelain studied medicine in Paris, then immunology in Canada, before taking up postdoctoral research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1989.At the time, there was great interest in developing vaccines to train the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells, in the same way it can be taught to tackle foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses.“But I started thinking that perhaps we should learn how to directly instruct the fighters of the immune system, in particular the T-cells,” he said, with his early work focused on mice.After moving to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, Sadelain developed a way to use a disabled virus to genetically reprogram human T-cells, so that they grew claw-like structures called antigen receptors, allowing the T-cells to target specific cancer cells.Beyond recognizing the cancer, these Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells, as Sadelain named them, were also given genetic instructions to enter a killing mode and to multiply, growing an army inside the body to eliminate the enemy.Thanks to the groundwork laid by June and Sadelain, there are now half a dozen US approved CAR-T cell therapies, with hundreds more trials underway.Patients’ own T-cells are collected, modified outside the body, then infused back into the blood, creating a so-called “living drug.”In a trial against multiple myeloma, a cancer that develops in plasma cells, 72 percent of patients responded to treatment, with total disappearance of the disease seen in 28 percent, among whom 65 percent had sustained eradication for 12 months. The treatment comes with serious side effects — including in some cases death — from the release of inflammatory molecules called cytokines. Doctors have learned to recognize and manage this better over time.Another risk is nervous system impairment, with symptoms such as deep confusion or inability to talk, although these clear up within days.Sadelain is excited for what the future could hold: from improving the T-cells so they tackle solid cancers, to treating autoimmune conditions such as lupus, to fighting currently intractable infections such as HIV.One area he acknowledges must improve is the sky high cost, with price tags upwards of $500,000. In the United States, private and government-subsidized insurers pick up most of the tab for those who qualify, as do health systems in Europe.“Researchers were aghast when we saw what was charged for these very first therapies,” he said. “The cost has to come down,” he added, something he expects to happen as the pharmaceutical industry improves its processes, and as scientists continue to innovate.For example, his own lab is preparing to publish a study showing that improvements to CAR-T cells’ efficiency vastly reduces the number needed for treatment.Other researchers are looking at using stem cells to manufacture CAR-T cells, creating a more economical “off the shelf” solution instead of relying on patients’ cells. Clinical testing is underway."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-surgeons-report-longest-successful-pig-to-human-kidney-transplant/,US surgeons report longest successful pig-to-human kidney transplant,1,"US surgeons who transplanted a genetically modified pig kidney into a brain-dead patient announced Thursday they had ended their experiment after a record-breaking 61 days.The latest experimental procedure is part of a growing field of research aimed at advancing cross-species transplants, mainly testing the technique on bodies that have been donated for science.There are more than 103,000 people waiting for organ transplants in the United States, 88,000 of whom need kidneys.“We have learned a great deal throughout these past two months of close observation and analysis, and there is great reason to be hopeful for the future,” said Robert Montgomery, director of the New York University Langone Transplant Institute, who led the surgery in July.It was the the fifth so-called xenotransplant performed by Montgomery, who also carried out the world’s first genetically modified pig kidney transplant in September 2021.Tissue collected during the study indicated a mild rejection process had begun, requiring intensification of immunosuppression medication.By “knocking out” the gene responsible for a biomolecule called alpha-gal — a prime target for roving human antibodies — the NYU Langone team were able to stop immediate rejection.The donor pig in this experiment came from a herd cultivated by Virginia-based biotech company Revivicor.The herd has also been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a source of meat for people with hypersensitivity to the alpha-gal molecule, an allergy caused by some tick bites.These pigs are bred, not cloned, meaning the process can be more easily scaled.Early xenotransplantation research focused on harvesting organs from primates — for example, a baboon heart was transplanted into a newborn known as “Baby Fae” in 1984, but she survived only 20 days.Current efforts focus on pigs, which are thought to be ideal donors for humans because of their organ size, their rapid growth and large litters, and the fact they are already raised as a food source.In January 2022, surgeons at the University of Maryland Medical School carried out the world’s first pig-to-human transplant on a living patient — this time involving a heart.He died two months after the milestone, with the presence of porcine cytomegalovirus in the organ later blamed.Last week, Chinese scientists published a paper showing they had succeeded in hybrid pig-human kidneys in pig embryos, an alternative approach that also has the potential to one day help address organ donation shortages.But the development raised ethical issues — especially since some human cells were also found in the pigs’ brains, experts said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/france-goes-a-bit-veggie-for-olympics/,France goes (a bit) veggie for Olympics,1,"With France slowly weaning itself off its traditional obsession with meat, the top chefs in charge of feeding the sporting masses at the 2024 Olympic Games are emphasising a more vegetarian approach.Michelin-starred chef Akrame Benallal serves plenty of steaks, burgers and other meat in his restaurants, but his flagship dish for the Games will be muesli with quinoa.“When there are 40,000 meals per day, I don’t want anyone to be let down. I want people who eat kosher to eat with me, people who eat halal, the Christians and Buddhists too,” he said.“It’s vegetables that unite everyone,” he added.He is one of three award-winning chefs overseeing the French food for the 15,000 athletes of the Olympic Village next summer. Another is Alexandre Mazzia, a former professional basketball player, who is offering recipes based around chickpeas, peas and smoked beetroot, and smoked fish with chard.They are working with a big food group, Sodexo Live!, that is running the restaurants and has made it a key objective to reduce the carbon footprint of its menu and use less animal protein.It claims that a third of the protein across its 500 dishes will come from vegetables, and one of its signature dishes will be a dal of green lentils from the Paris region with skyr (a type of yoghurt), coriander and corn oil.French people on average consume 113 kilos of meat annually — more than most European countries and almost double the global average — according to Our World in Data.But with the country committed to cutting its meat consumption for environmental reasons, the Olympics could mark a turning point, said food historian Loic Bienassis.“Historically, there are no famous French dishes that don’t include meat. To say ‘Let’s do some French cuisine but cut out the meat’ is a major turnaround,” he said. There will still be plenty of meat in the Olympic Village, of course.The last of the three top French chefs is Amandine Chaignot, who has chosen guinea fowl with crayfish as her signature meal.“Clearly, when we think of traditional French cuisine, we think more of ‘steak au poivre’ than quinoa risotto,” she joked.But vegetables alone cannot meet all the needs of the world’s top sportspeople, said Helene Defrance, a medal-winning sailor and nutritionist who is on the athletes’ commission for 2024.“Vegetarianism is a big trend… but it’s not something that we can impose on everyone,” she told AFP.Pulses can be hard to digest and not everyone converts plant proteins effectively, she said.But as Mazzia points out, their food is more for celebrating after the competition than during the build-up.“I’m interested in everything related to kilocalories and the like, but that’s not what I’m here for,” he said.“The important thing during the Games is to stop and take a moment to enjoy something totally different. I hope the athletes come to celebrate their medal victories with me.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covids-back-heres-what-to-know-this-fall-and-winter/,Covid’s back: Here’s what to know this fall and winter,1,"As colder weather sets in, Covid rates are once more rising across the Northern Hemisphere, with several new variants on the scene.Here’s what you need to know. The Covid pandemic extracted a terrible toll, with nearly seven million deaths worldwide.But thanks to vaccines, prior immunity and better treatments, the virus is now far more manageable. In the United States, excess deaths — the total number of people dying for any given cause — has been normal since spring.“If you asked me to choose between getting flu and Covid, I would pick Covid because each individual case of flu is more dangerous,” said Ashish Jha, a former White House Covid coordinator and dean of public health at Brown University.But while Covid is now less deadly to individuals, “it also seems to have higher rates of long term complications.”Covid is also less seasonal than the flu, more contagious, and over the last three US winters peaked from December to January, while flu peaks later.Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, placed Covid “on par” with flu and RSV, but stressed it was more severe than the common cold.– To boost or not to boost? – Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax have developed new vaccines that more closely target current variants, all offshoots of Omicron which became dominant in late 2021.There is broad consensus that annual boosters will benefit the most vulnerable. But whether they bring added value to everyone is debated.Nearly everyone has already been infected, studies show. And prior infections combined with vaccines have trained immune systems to stop severe outcomes even when they can’t ward off infection.One-size-fits-all recommendations no longer make sense, and could decrease trust in public health, said Monica Gandhi, author of “Endemic: A Post-Pandemic Playbook.”For example, the mRNA vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna carry small risks of heart inflammation in younger men.European nations advise annual shots only for higher risk groups, but some experts don’t see downsides in wider recommendations.“People at low risk still derive benefit from boosters,” said Ziyad Al-Aly, an epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis. The United States recommends that nearly everyone get annual Covid shots. Experts diverge on this subject, one of the most controversial of the pandemic.A review of clinical trial data by the respected nonprofit Cochrane on whether promoting mask-wearing helped slow respiratory viruses found inconclusive results.Whether broad mandates have a significant effect, therefore, hasn’t been proven.What researchers do know — thanks to lab experiments — is that well-fitted, high-caliber masks such as N-95s protect individuals.“Individuals can therefore choose to wear well-fitted and filtered masks indoors to provide personal protection from respiratory pathogens,” said Gandhi, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco — though she believes in vaccines to prevent severe disease, including among the high-risk. Experts agree that it makes sense for people at risk — the elderly and those with conditions such as cancer, obesity and diabetes — to test when they have symptoms.That’s because these groups “would benefit from antiviral therapy within the five-day window,” said Adaja.The most prominent treatment is Paxlovid, which has been shown to reduce the risk of severe disease and death among high-risk people.Some health systems have decided testing at-risk people is all that’s needed.“Most people no longer need to take a coronavirus test. To prevent the spread of infection, you should try to stay at home if you’re unwell,” says the UK’s National Health System. Research around long Covid — symptoms that linger for weeks or months — remains nebulous and hampered by a lack of standardized definitions for a condition that has multiple causes, said Adalja.Al-Aly estimates prevalence at between 4-7 percent, or 65 million people worldwide.“Unfortunately, we have not made progress on treating long Covid. This should be an urgent priority for research,” he said.It does appear that prior vaccination reduces the risk of long Covid, and that the condition is correlated with severity of infection.The US government has funded several trials into the condition, with one recent study finding a diabetes drug called metformin reduced the risk of ongoing symptoms by 40 percent.Jha said he was hopeful of more data on treatments in the coming months."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/lead-poisoning-causes-far-more-death-iq-loss-than-thought-study/,Lead poisoning causes far more death,1,"Lead poisoning has a far greater impact on global health than previously thought, potentially contributing to over five million deaths a year and posing a similar threat to air pollution, modelling research suggested Tuesday.The study, described as “a wake-up call”, also estimated that exposure to the toxic metal causes young children in developing countries to lose an average of nearly six IQ points each.Lead pollution has been shown to cause a range of serious health problems, particularly relating to heart disease and the brain development of small children, resulting in leaded gasoline being banned worldwide.But people can still be exposed to the potent neurotoxin via food, soil, cookware, fertilisers, cosmetics, lead–acid car batteries and other sources.The two World Bank economists who authored the study, published in the Lancet Planetary Health journal, said it was the first to assess the impact of lead exposure on heart disease deaths and child IQ loss in wealthy and developing nations.Lead author Bjorn Larsen told AFP that when the pair first saw the figure their model calculated, “we didn’t even dare to whisper the number” because it was so “enormous”.Their model estimates that 5.5 million adults died from heart disease in 2019 because of lead exposure, 90 percent of them in low- and middle-income countries.That is six times higher than the previous estimate, and represents around 30 percent of all deaths from cardiovascular disease — the leading cause of death worldwide.It would mean that lead exposure is a bigger cause of heart disease than smoking or cholesterol, Larsen said. The research also estimated that children under five lost a cumulative 765 million IQ points due to lead poisoning globally in 2019, with 95 percent of those losses coming in developing countries.That number is nearly 80 percent higher than previously estimated.The World Bank researchers put the economic cost of lead exposure at $6 trillion in 2019, equivalent to seven percent of global gross domestic product.For the analysis, the researchers used estimates of blood lead levels in 183 countries taken from the landmark 2019 Global Burden of Disease study.Previous research had measured only lead’s effect on heart disease when it came to raising blood pressure. But the new study looked at numerous other ways lead affects hearts, such as the hardening of arteries that can lead to stroke, resulting in the higher numbers, Larsen said.Roy Harrison, an expert in air pollution and health at Birmingham University in the UK, who was not involved in the study, told AFP it was “interesting, but subject to many uncertainties”.For example, the relationship between lead in blood and heart disease is based on a survey in the United States, and whether those findings could be applied worldwide “is a huge jump of faith”, he said.Harrison also pointed out that the model used estimations — not tests — of lead in blood in many developing countries.If the results were confirmed, “they would be of major public health significance, but at present, this is simply an interesting hypothesis”, he said. Richard Fuller, president of the NGO Pure Earth, said that when surveys in developing countries did test for lead in blood, they mostly found higher levels than estimated in the new study.This means “the impact of lead might be worse than the report describes”, he told AFP, calling it a “wake-up call”.Larsen said “we’re still a little in the dark” when it came to understanding how much different sources of lead contribute to blood contamination.Fuller said part of this “missing piece of the puzzle” was revealed in a Pure Earth report released on Tuesday, which analysed 5,000 samples of consumer goods and food in 25 developing countries.It found high rates of lead contamination in metal pots and pans, ceramic cookware, paint, cosmetics and toys.“This is why poorer countries have so much lead poisoning,” Fuller said. “It’s items in the kitchen that are poisoning them.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/countries-block-swedish-pork-over-swine-fever-outbreak/,IQ loss than thought: study,1,"– Several countries have blocked imports of Swedish pork after a recent outbreak of African swine fever in wild boars in the Scandinavian country, industry officials said Monday.Armenia, Australia, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Ukraine have halted Swedish pork imports even though the disease has only been detected in wild boars at this stage, the Swedish Meat Industry Association told AFP.“This meat poses no danger… I think it’s unreasonable, but this is standard procedure for when African swine flu is detected,” managing director Magnus Darth told AFP.Seven cases of the disease have been detected in dead wild boars since September 6 near Fagersta, some 145 kilometres (90 miles) northwest of Stockholm.The illness does not affect humans but is highly contagious and fatal for pigs and their wild relatives, and an outbreak is potentially devastating for the pork industry, experts say.A 2018 outbreak in China — the world’s largest pork producer — caused millions of pigs to be slaughtered to stop the spread.Swedish authorities have blocked public access to forest and wildlife areas in a 1,000-square-kilometre (386-square-mile) swathe around the zone where the infected boars were found.It is not yet known how the infection came to Sweden, with the closest known cases found in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states.“It is a long-distance jump from the nearest infected area in Europe and we therefore assume that it has been introduced through human activity and not wild boar,” Sweden’s National Veterinary Institute (SVA) said in a statement.Neighbouring Denmark, a large pork manufacturer whose exports account for almost half of Danish agricultural exports, has said it believes the risk is low that African swine fever will spread to the country.Sweden exports around 30,000 tonnes of pig meat each year, with about half going to EU countries.The import stop is expected to lead a loss of income of 50 million kronor ($4.5 million) per year, for an industry with annual revenue of around 30 billion kronor, Darth said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/scientists-grow-human-like-kidneys-in-pigs/,Countries block Swedish pork over swine fever outbreak,1,"Chinese scientists have succeeded in growing kidneys containing human cells in pig embryos, a world first that could one day help address organ donation shortages.But the development, described in a study in the journal Cell Stem Cell on Thursday, raises ethical issues — especially since some human cells were also found in the pigs’ brains, experts said.The researchers from the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health focused on kidneys because they are one of the first organs to develop, and the most commonly transplanted in human medicine.“Rat organs have been produced in mice, and mouse organs have been produced in rats, but previous attempts to grow human organs in pigs have not succeeded,” senior author Liangxue Lai said in a statement.“Our approach improves the integration of human cells into recipient tissues and allows us to grow human organs in pigs.”This is a different approach to the recent high-profile breakthroughs in the United States, where genetically modified pig kidneys and even a heart have been placed inside humans.The new paper “describes pioneering steps in a new approach to organ bioengineering using pigs as incubators for growing and cultivating human organs,” said Dusko Ilic, a professor of stem cell sciences at King’s College London who was not involved in the research.Ilic cautioned there would be many challenges to turning the experiment into a viable solution, but “nevertheless, this captivating strategy warrants further exploration.” A major challenge in creating such hybrids has been that pig cells outcompete human cells.To overcome the obstacles, the team used CRISPR gene editing to delete two genes essential for kidneys to form inside a pig embryo, creating what’s called a “niche.”They then added specially prepared human pluripotent stem cells — cells that have the potential to develop into any cell type — which filled the niche.Before implanting the embryos in sows, they grew them in test tubes containing substances that nourished both the human and pig cells.In total, they transferred 1,820 embryos into 13 surrogate mothers. The pregnancies were terminated at 25 and 28 days to assess how the experiment had worked.Five embryos selected for analysis were found to have functionally normal kidneys for their stage of development, beginning to grow the ureters that would eventually connect them to the bladder.They contained between 50 and 60 percent human cells.“We found that if you create a niche in the pig embryo, then the human cells naturally go into these spaces,” said co-author Zhen Dai.“We saw only very few human neural cells in the brain and spinal cord and no human cells in the genital ridge.”Preventing the invasion of human cells into reproductive tissue is considered crucial, because otherwise there is a risk of uncontrolled creation of human-pig hybrids.But the presence of any human cells in the pig brains still raises concerns, said Darius Widera, a professor of stem cell biology at the University of Reading.“Although this approach is a clear milestone and the first successful attempt to grow whole organs containing human cells in pigs, the proportion of human cells in the generated kidneys is still not high enough,” he added.In the long run, the team wants to optimize their technology for use in human transplantation, but admit it’s not ready yet.An important limitation was the kidneys had pig-derived vascular cells, which could cause rejection if transplanted into a human.Nevertheless, the scientists plan to press on and allow the kidneys to develop for a longer duration. They are also working on growing other human organs in pigs such as the heart and pancreas."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/eu-drug-watchdog-approves-updated-pfizer-covid-jab/,Scientists grow human-like kidneys in pigs,1,"THE HAGUE, Aug 30, 2023 (AFP) – The EU’s drug watchdog on Wednesday approved an updated version of Pfizer and BioNTech’s anti-Covid jab to counter an infectious subvariant of the virus as winter approaches.The World Health Organisation in May said it no longer considered Covid-19 a global health emergency, but the virus is still circulating — and new variants are being tracked.The European Medicines Agency said it “has recommended authorising an adapted Comirnaty vaccine targeting the Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant”.The EMA in June recommended that vaccines be updated to target the XBB strain of the virus which have become dominant in Europe and other parts of the world.Known as Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5, the mRNA vaccine is to be used to prevent Covid-19 in adults and children from six months.Adults and children over five require a single shot “irrespective of their Covid-19 vaccination history” while younger children may get “one or three doses depending on whether they have completed a primary vaccination course or have had Covid-19” the Amsterdam-based EMA said.Comirnaty uses messenger RNA technology which carries instructions how to make the spike protein which the virus uses to enter the body’s cells.When a person is given the vaccine, some of their cells will read the mRNA instructions and temporarily produce the spike protein.If the vaccinated person later comes into contact with the virus, the immune system will recognise the spike protein on its surface and be prepared to attack it.Comirnaty was first authorised in the EU in September 2020 with versions targeting other Covid-19 subvariants, in September 2022.“Side effects are typically mild and short-lived,” the EMA said, but added “that more serious side effects may rarely occur.”Pharmaceutical firms Moderna and Novavax and others are working on updating their Covid vaccines to target XBB subvariants.The WHO is currently monitoring upwards of 10 variants and their descent lineages."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/brain-implants-provide-hope-for-those-unable-to-speak/,EU drug watchdog approves updated Pfizer Covid jab,1,"Restoring the power of speech to those who have lost it through illness or accident is becoming an ever more plausible concept, based on results from two brain implants that show encouraging results, researchers say.Pat Bennett, 68, was a dynamic and sporty human resources senior executive before being diagnosed more than a decade ago with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, a neural disorder resulting from damage to nerves that transmit data from the brain and spinal cord to and from the rest of the body.The ailment, which attacks neutrons controlling movement, is neurodegenerative and progressively shuts down a patient’s movement to the point of paralysis.Pat started out experiencing difficulty in enunciating words, then eventually lost the ability to speak entirely.But important advances are being made in tackling such disorders through implants.The journal Nature reported Wednesday that researchers from Stanford University’s department of neuroscience in March last year implanted into Pat’s brain four small squares of 64 micro-electrodes made of silicone.Penetrating a mere 1.5 millimetres into the cerebral cortex, they record electrical signals produced by the areas of the brain that are linked to the production of language.The signals produced are conveyed outside the skull via a bundle of cables and processed by an algorithm. Over four months the system “learned” to interpret the signals’ meanings by associating them with phonemes — units of sound that distinguish one word from another — and processing them with the help of a language model.“With these new studies it is now possible to imagine a future where we can restore fluid conversation with someone with paralysis,” Frank Willett, Stanford professor and co-author of the study, told reporters.Using her brain-computer interface (BCI) machine, Pat Bennett can speak via a screen at more than 60 words a minute.That is short of the 150 to 200 words per minute for a standard conversation, but still more than three times faster than the previous machine-aided mark from 2021, when the Stanford team took charge of her case.Moreover, the error rate for a 50-word vocabulary has dropped to below 10 percent from 20 percent previously. In a second test, Edward Chang, chair of neurological surgery at the University of California San Francisco and his team used a device resting on a thin strip of 253 electrodes placed on cortical material.Its performance proved comparable to that of the Stanford team’s system in obtaining a median of 78 words per minute, or five times faster than before.It was a major leap forward for the patient, a paraplegic since suffering a brainstem haemorrhage who had previously been able to communicate only at a maximum 14 words per minute, through a technique relying on interpreting head movements.In both these two tests the rate of error rises to around 25 percent when patients use a vocabulary extending to thousands of words.The particularity of Chang’s system is that it is based on analysis of the signals emitted not only in brain areas directly linked to language but also more broadly in the sensorimotor cortex.That covers the brain’s primary sensory and motor areas and activates the facial and oral muscles to produce sounds.“About five to six years ago we really started to understand the electrical patterns that give rise to the movements of the lips, jaw and tongue that allow us to produce the specific sounds of each individual consonant and vowels and words,” Chang said.His team’s brain-machine interface produces language in the form of text but also via a synthetic voice and an avatar that reproduces a patient’s facial expressions when they speak.“Speech isn’t just about communicating just words but also who we are — our voice and expression are also parts of our identity,” Chang said.The team is now seeking to come up with a wireless version of the device, which would have “profound implications” for a patient’s independence and social interactions, according to David Moses, a co-author of the study and adjunct professor of neurological surgery at the University of San Francisco."

There have since been a handful of other cases, with all the experiments running for two or three days.While previous transplants have involved body parts with up to 10 genetic modifications, the latest had just one: in the gene involved in so-called “hyperacute rejection,” which would otherwise occur within minutes of an animal organ being connected to a human circulatory system.By “knocking out” the gene responsible for a biomolecule called alpha-gal — a prime target for roving human antibodies — the NYU Langone team were able to stop immediate rejection.“We’ve now gathered more evidence to show that, at least in kidneys, just eliminating the gene that triggers a hyperacute rejection may be enough along with clinically approved immunosuppressive drugs to successfully manage the transplant in a human for optimal performance — potentially in the long-term,” said Montgomery.They also embedded the pig’s thymus gland — which lies around the neck and is responsible for educating the immune system — in the kidney’s outer layer.Adam Griesemer, of the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, added that this practice allowed immune cells in the host’s body to learn to recognize the pig’s cells as its own, preventing a delayed rejection.Both of the patient’s own kidneys were removed, then one pig kidney was transplanted, and started immediately producing urine.Monitoring showed that levels of creatinine, a waste product, were at optimal levels, and there was no evidence of rejection.– No evidence of pig virus – Crucially, no evidence of porcine cytomegalovirus — which may trigger organ failure — have been detected since the transplant, and the team plan to continue monitoring for another month.The research was made possible by the family of the 57-year-old male patient, Maurice “Mo” Miller, who was found unresponsive in his bathroom in July. Doctors determined he had an aggressive form of brain cancer, and would not wake up.“Though my brother cannot be here, I can say with confidence he would be proud of the fact in the tragedy of his death, his legacy will be helping many people live,” his sister Mary Miller-Duffy told reporters.In January 2022, surgeons at the University of Maryland Medical School carried out the world’s first pig-to-human transplant on a living patient — this time involving a heart. He died two months after the milestone, with the presence of porcine cytomegalovirus in the organ later blamed.The donor pig in these experiments came from a herd from Virginia-based biotech company Revivicor. The herd was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a source of meat for people with hypersensitivity to the alpha-gal molecule, an allergy caused by tick bites.These pigs are bred, not cloned, meaning the process can be more easily scaled.Early so-called xenotransplantation research focused on harvesting organs from primates — for example, a baboon heart was transplanted into a newborn known as “Baby Fae” in 1984, but she survived only 20 days.Current efforts focus on pigs, which are thought to be ideal donors for humans because of their organ size, their rapid growth and large litters, and the fact they are already raised as a food source."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-court-restricts-access-to-abortion-pill-ruling-on-hold/,US surgeons say pig kidney functional in human for more than a month,1,"The ruling by a three-judge panel of the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit Court of Appeals would limit use of mifepristone to the first seven weeks of pregnancy, instead of 10, and block it from being distributed by mail.It would also require the abortion pill, which accounts for more than half of the abortions in the United States, to be prescribed by a doctor.Despite the ruling by the panel of conservative judges, two of whom were appointed by former president Donald Trump and one by former president George W. Bush, the drug will remain on the market for the time being.Anti-abortion groups are seeking to have mifepristone banned, claiming despite its long track record that it is unsafe. The case is the latest skirmish in the battle over reproductive rights in the United States.The appeals court said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which approved the abortion pill in 2000 and made it more readily available in 2016, “failed to address several important concerns about whether the drug would be safe for the women who use it.”At a hearing in May, the three judges pushed back against government arguments that the decision on whether to allow the use of mifepristone should be left to the FDA.The case stems from a ruling by a conservative US District Court judge in Texas that would have banned mifepristone.The 5th Circuit Court blocked a ban on the abortion pill, but imposed restrictions on access, after which the baton was handed to the Supreme Court, where conservatives wield a 6-3 majority.The Supreme Court temporarily preserved access to mifepristone, freezing the rulings by the lower courts and sending the case back to the 5th Circuit, whose latest decision will also remain on hold until the nation’s highest court decides whether it will hear the case.It would be the most significant abortion case to reach the nine-member Supreme Court since it overturned the constitutional right to the procedure in June of last year.Since then, some 20 states, mostly in the South and the Midwest, have prohibited abortion outright or restricted access while others, mainly on the coasts, have moved to protect it. Reacting to the 5th Circuit ruling, the Center for Reproductive Rights said there is “scientific CONSENSUS on the exemplary safety and efficacy of mifepristone.“Medication abortion is used in over half of all abortions in the US and the imposition of outdated, unscientific restrictions will harm millions of the most vulnerable pregnant people in the US,” it said.Katie Daniel, state policy director of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, welcomed the court’s decision.“The FDA ignored science and its own rules when it rubber-stamped Democrats’ reckless mail-order abortion scheme,” Daniel said.“We won’t rest until the FDA and the profit-driven abortion industry are held accountable for the suffering they’ve inflicted on women and girls, as well as the deaths of countless unborn children,” she said.The FDA estimates that 5.6 million Americans have used it to terminate pregnancies since mifepristone was approved in 2000."

Ira Helfand, ex-president of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and a co-author the editorial, told AFP: “We are facing an extraordinarily dangerous moment where the possibility of nuclear war is real.”He pointed to a comment made just this week by former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev threatening the use of nuclear weapons if Ukraine’s counter-offensive captured Russian territory.“We don’t know if the threats are real or if they’re just put forward to scare people, but I think we have to take them very seriously,” Helfand said.He also pointed to North Korea, which Japan said last week posed a more serious threat to national security “than ever before”.The editorial was released on the same week that a preparatory committee meeting is being held in Vienna for a review of the UN’s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which entered force in 1970.A review of the keystone treaty held last year failed to adopt a joint declaration, with the United States denouncing “cynical obstructionism” from Russia.The editorial lamented that “progress has been disappointingly slow”.Sunday also marks the 68th anniversary of the first nuclear weapon being used on civilians — the US detonated an atomic bomb over the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/croatia-targets-latest-climate-change-threat-mosquitoes/,Croatia targets latest climate-change threat: mosquitoes,1,"ZAGREB, July 20, 2023 (AFP) – Hordes of buzzing but sterile mosquitoes are being let loose in Zagreb as Croatia gets ahead of worries that climate change could bring tropical diseases to the Mediterranean nation.The release is part of a pilot project focused on eradicating invasive Asian Tiger mosquitoes known for carrying sicknesses like Dengue Fever, Chikungunya and Zika.The species has appeared to thrive in the country and across the region in recent years due in part to climate change — with the warmer weather providing fertile ground for the mosquito.“It’s too early to say whether this one will yield results,” Zagreb resident Kruno Lokotar told AFP. “But I’m glad that we are not just sticking with spraying.”Croatia’s effort centres on a method that uses sterilised male mosquitoes — which once released into the wild will mate with females and neutralise the potential for future offspring.The Zagreb project kickstarted in June, when 100,000 mosquitoes were released in a high-risk area with thick foliage where mosquitoes often congregate.“If we release a sufficient number of sterile males during a certain period in an area, the mosquito population in that area will decrease,” Ana Klobucar, a medical entomologist of the Zagreb-based teaching institute of public health who is overseeing the project, told AFP.The plan is rooted in the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) — a method that has been used for decades across the world to combat various harmful insects, but is still being tested for its effectiveness against mosquitoes in urban areas.Croatia started using it for mosquitoes last year in northern Istria peninsula.This year a total of 1.2 million specially treated insects will be released there over a three-month period, entomologist Nediljko Landeka of the regional public health institute told AFP.– Climate change impact – The insects — which have been rendered sterile after exposure to gamma rays — are sourced from a laboratory in Italy, and shipped 500 kilometres (310 miles) to Croatia in special boxes.Once received, Klobucar and her assistants carefully remove plastic bowls with the insects from cardboard tubes before they are later dispersed in local gardens in the target area.Croatia’s programme coincides with increasingly dire warning from experts that global warming could make swaths of Europe more vulnerable to infectious diseases spread by mosquito bites.The presence of the Asian Tiger mosquito in Croatia was first recorded in 2004 after arriving in Europe in the late 1970s, with experts suggesting they made the journey in used tyres that arrived in Albania from China.The breed has now spread to more than a dozen European countries, with the Mediterranean region having been hit the hardest, according to official figures.As the mercury rises across the globe, the Asian Tiger mosquito is moving further north including in areas that were considered too cold for the species to thrive, including in Switzerland and Germany.“We are afraid that together with the species, viruses could also easily adapt in the future to new environments,” warned Greek entomologist Antonios Michaelakis.Michaelakis — who is also a researcher at the Benaki Phytopathological Institute in Athens — has been instrumental in sharing his experiences from a programme in Greece with his Croatian counterparts.In Greece in 2019, the project succeeded in slashing the population of Asian Tiger mosquitoes by 90 percent, he told AFP.During a trial of the technique last year in Croatia’s Istria, up to 14 percent of mosquito eggs in the area were found to be sterile and jumped to nearly 60 percent this year, Landeka added."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/doctors-walk-out-in-uk-health-services-biggest-strike/,Doctors walk out in UK health service’s biggest strike,1,"LONDON, July 13, 2023 (AFP) – Hospital doctors in England will on Thursday stage the biggest walkout in the history of the UK’s state-funded National Health Service, prompting fears for patient safety.The unprecedented five-day stoppage over pay and staffing is the latest in eight months of industrial action across the NHS, which is already reeling from a vast pandemic backlog.Nurses, ambulance staff and other medical staff have all joined picket lines in recent months, adding to pressures on patient appointments.The industrial action by junior doctors — those below consultant level — is due to begin at 7:00 am (0600 GMT) and last until 7:00 am on Tuesday.It comes against a background of walk-outs across the economy from train drivers to lawyers over the past year as the UK battles a crippling cost-of-living crisis.Senior hospital doctors, known as consultants, in England will also begin a 48-hour strike on July 20, with radiographers following suit from July 25.The bitter row between junior doctors and the government has seen them call for their 2008-9 pay levels to be restored — something the government says would mean an average pay award of about 35 percent.The British Medical Association’s Junior Doctors Committee says medics have effectively had a 26 percent pay cut in real terms in the last 15 years, as salaries have failed to keep pace with soaring inflation.The government claims that backdating their pay to reflect inflation since 2008 is too costly and has instead offered an extra five percent, as it battles to reduce inflation.“Today marks the start of the longest single walkout by doctors in the NHS’s history, but this is still not a record that needs to go into the history books,” BMA leaders Robert Laurenson and Vivek Trivedi said ahead of the action.“We can call this strike off today if the UK government will simply follow the example of the government in Scotland and drop their nonsensical precondition of not talking whilst strikes are announced and produce an offer which is credible to the doctors they are speaking with.”Similar stoppages in June and April resulted in massive disruption with hundreds of thousands of hospital appointments and operations rescheduled.“The complete inflexibility we see from the UK government today is baffling, frustrating, and ultimately destructive for everyone who wants waiting lists to go down and NHS staffing numbers to go up,” Laurenson and Trivedi added.About seven million people were waiting for treatment in April — a record — with nearly three million waiting more than 18 months, according to the BMA."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-makes-new-alzheimers-drug-more-widely-accessible/,US makes new Alzheimer’s drug more widely accessible,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The US drug regulator gave full approval to a new Alzheimer’s medicine on Thursday, a move that makes it more widely available to the public through government-run health insurance for the elderly.Leqembi, developed jointly by Japan’s Eisai and Biogen of the United States, was shown in a clinical trial to modestly reduce cognitive decline among patients in the early stages of the disease.But the study also raised concerns about side effects including brain bleeds and swelling.Leqembi was initially granted “accelerated approval” by the Food and Drug Administration in January, which meant it was not broadly covered by the government-run Medicare program for people aged 65 and older.Thursday’s decision, which follows further study of the drug, means Medicare will now defray a large portion of treatment, initially listed by the makers at $26,500 per year.“This confirmatory study verified that it is a safe and effective treatment for patients with Alzheimer’s disease,” senior FDA official Teresa Buracchio said in a statement.Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, administrator of the agency that runs Medicare, added: “This is welcome news for the millions of people in this country and their families who are affected by this debilitating disease.”But people covered by Medicare will still need to meet 20 percent of the cost, or thousands of dollars, themselves.Approximately 6.5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer’s, which is characterized by memory loss and declining mental acuity.Leqembi, also known as lecanemab, is an antibody treatment that is injected into the brain every two weeks and works by reducing amyloid beta, a protein that builds into plaques and causes brain cells to die, as well as brain shrinkage.The FDA’s decision was welcomed by patient groups.“This treatment, while not a cure, can give people in the early stages of Alzheimer’s more time to maintain their independence and do the things they love,” said Joanne Pike, Alzheimer’s Association president and CEO.“This gives people more months of recognizing their spouse, children and grandchildren.”Leqembi was the second Alzheimer’s drug developed by Eisai and Biogen to receive approval. The first, Aduhelm, was approved in 2021 but the decision was highly controversial as the data about its efficacy was inconsistent.In May, US drugmaker Eli Lilly announced its drug donanemab also significantly slowed cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer’s, and would soon seek worldwide regulatory approval.Alzheimer’s disease accounts for 60 to 80 percent of dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. It progressively destroys thinking and memory, eventually robbing people of the ability to carry out the simplest of tasks.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/study-highlights-limitations-of-bmi-in-predicting-death/,Study highlights limitations of BMI in predicting death,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — People classified as overweight though not obese are not at a higher risk of death, according to a new study Wednesday that underscores the limitations of the body mass index (BMI), long a standard medical metric.The findings, published in the journal PLOS ONE, come as populations in both rich and poor countries are becoming heavier. In the United States, more than 70 percent of adults are defined as either overweight or obese.BMI, which was first described by a Belgian mathematician in the 19th century, is calculated by dividing a person’s weight by the square of their height. It is increasingly seen as a crude instrument for measuring individual health.Lead author Aayush Visaria of Rutgers University told AFP: “I think the real thing that people should get from this is that BMI by itself is just not a great indicator of health.”Measuring waist circumference or performing a type of scan that visualizes bone density, body fat and muscle mass should also be used for a more holistic interpretation, he said. Having excess fat still increases risk for a range of conditions including heart disease, stroke and diabetes.“I’ve seen patients with the same exact BMI, but with vastly different metabolic and health implications. So I wanted to investigate this further,” added Visaria, a physician.Older studies on the link between weight and death rates drew inconsistent and uncertain results, and were mostly focused only on non-Hispanic white adults.In the new work, Visaria and his co-author Soko Setoguchi drew on data on more than 550,000 American adults from the 1999-2018 National Health Interview Survey and the 2019 US National Death Index.They calculated BMI based on the self-reported height and weight of the participants, and gathered data on demographics, socio-behavioral factors such as smoking and physical activity, underlying health conditions, and access to healthcare.More than 75,000 people who were included in the study died during the period of research.After adjusting for other variables, the results showed that people with a BMI between 25 and 30, which is classified as overweight, did not have an increased risk of death compared to people whose BMI was between 22.5 and 24.9.However, the mortality risk rose markedly among people whose BMI was under 20, and those with BMI greater or equal to 30, defined as obese. For example, a person with “third degree” obesity, defined as a BMI of 40 or above, but had never smoked and had no history of cardiovascular disease or non-skin cancer, was more than twice as likely to die as an equivalent counterpart with BMI defined as average.The average age of participants was 46. Half were female, and 69 percent were non-Hispanic white. Of those included, 35 percent had a BMI between 25 and 30, and 27.2 percent had a BMI above or equal to 30.“It’s a large study with a representative sample which is good,” George Savva, a biostatistician at the Quadram Institute in the United Kingdom, told AFP. “The authors have, as far as I can see, done a good job of analyzing the mortality link with baseline weight status.”He added it might be the case that diseases linked with higher weight are managed better than they once were, for example high blood pressure and high cholesterol.“So you would expect the relationship between weight and death to change over time, which potentially is what this is showing,” Savva said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/britains-public-health-service-at-75-on-life-support/,Britain’s public health service at 75: on life support?,1,"LONDON, July 4, 2023 (AFP) – Deeply loved but wracked by crisis, Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) on Wednesday marks 75 years since it was founded as the Western world’s first universal, free healthcare system.In a secular age, the NHS is the closest thing Britain has to a national religion — devoutly cherished, with levels of public support higher than the royal family or any other British institution.It was founded three years after World War II by a pioneering Labour government on the principle that everyone should access top-quality healthcare funded by general taxation, free at the point of care.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whose parents were an NHS doctor and a pharmacist, paid tribute last week as he outlined a 15-year plan aimed at recruiting hundreds of thousands of new health staff.“For every minute of every day of every one of those 75 years, the NHS has been kept going by the millions of people who’ve worked for it. To them on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to say: thank you,” he said.“I feel a powerful sense of responsibility to make sure that their legacy endures. And to make sure the NHS is there for our children and grandchildren, just as it was there for us.”Like Sunak’s parents, immigrant staff were pivotal to the NHS’s early growth, helping to remake the face of Britain itself in the decades after the war.Its centrality to national life was underscored in a memorable dance sequence featuring NHS staff and patients during the opening of the London Olympics in 2012.Justin Bieber remixed his hit “Holy” with an NHS choir for Christmas 2020, in a year when the public, clapping on their doorsteps, paid tribute to medics battling the Covid pandemic. Sunak’s new workforce plan, however, is recognition that the NHS is under unprecedented strain following the pandemic, even though the government spends nearly 12 percent of its budget on healthcare — by far its single biggest item.Demoralised doctors and nurses have been striking for better pay, an ageing and unfit population needs ever-more complex treatment, cancers go undiagnosed for lack of scanners, and hospitals are crumbling.Sumi Manirajan, deputy chair of the British Medical Association’s junior doctors committee, accused Sunak’s Conservative government of failing to value doctors.“And what that leads to is doctors leaving the country, going abroad, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and actually it’s the public that loses out,” she told AFP at a protest rally by striking doctors.“The government (ministers), they may use private health care but the ordinary citizen in the UK uses the NHS, relies on the NHS.”In a report for the 75th anniversary, the King’s Fund charity compared the health systems of 19 similar countries and found Britain’s in a sickly state.It cited data showing the UK performed worst in fatality rates for strokes and second-worst for heart attacks.The UK has a “strikingly low number of both nurses and doctors per person compared to its peers” and four times fewer hospital and intensive care beds than Germany, the report said.But opinion polls show scant support in Britain for radical reform such as switching to a mixed model of funding, with patients paying via insurance for some of their treatment, as is the norm elsewhere.Fully 93 percent of more than 3,000 respondents believe the NHS should remain free at the point of care, based on general taxation, according to the annual British Social Attitudes Survey last year.But the authoritative survey also found a record 51 percent were dissatisfied with their quality of care, especially with waiting times for appointments to see general practitioners and hospital doctors. Sunak has been resisting the medics’ pay demands as he battles to get soaring UK inflation under control, while insisting his government is investing “record sums” in the NHS.But the service needs to be modernised via better use of digital technology including artificial intelligence, he said on Friday.Sunak argued that his workforce plan would make the NHS fit “for decades to come”. But some on the front lines give a far gloomier prognosis.“Right now, as a functional, universal public service, the NHS is failing,” geriatrics consultant David Oliver wrote in The BMJ, a medical journal.He warned: “It may not quite be in end-of-life care, or about to have its financial or political life support removed, but without immediate action and longer-term thinking it won’t see its 85th birthday.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/diabetes-cases-to-double-to-1-3-billion-by-2050-study/,Diabetes cases to double to 1.3 billion by 2050: study,1,"PARIS, June 22, 2023 (AFP) — The number of people suffering from diabetes worldwide will more than double to 1.3 billion by 2050 driven by structural racism and gaping inequality between countries, new research predicted on Friday.Every country on the globe will see an increase in the number of patients with the chronic disease, according to the most comprehensive analysis of global data projecting out to 2050.Some 529 million people were estimated to already be living with diabetes, one of the top 10 causes of death and disability.That number — 95 percent of which are cases of type 2 diabetes — will top 1.3 billion in less than three decades, according to a study published in the Lancet journal.High body mass index — an indication that people could be overweight — was linked to more than half of deaths and disability from diabetes.Other factors included people’s diets, exercise, smoking and alcohol.Liane Ong, lead research scientist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and first author of one of the studies, said one factor was how diets had changed.“Over the course of 30 years, different countries have really migrated from traditional food habits — maybe eating more fruits and vegetables, eating healthier greens — to more highly processed foods,” she told AFP.The research also estimated that by 2045, three quarters of adults with diabetes will live in low- and middle-income countries.But even in wealthy countries such as the United States, diabetes rates were almost 1.5 times higher among minorities such as black, Hispanic, Asian or Native Americans, a separate Lancet study said.Study co-author Leonard Egede, of the Medical College of Wisconsin, blamed a “cascade of widening diabetes inequity”.“Racist policies such as residential segregation affect where people live, their access to sufficient and healthy food and health care services,” he said in a statement.Ong said “the challenge is that we don’t really see one type of intervention that’s going to fix everything”.Instead, fighting diabetes will require long-term planning, investment and attention from countries around the globe, she said.In an editorial, the Lancet said that “the world has failed to understand the social nature of diabetes and underestimated the true scale and threat the disease poses.”“Diabetes will be a defining disease of this century,” it added."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/night-owls-die-earlier-due-to-drinking-and-smoking-study/,Night owls die earlier due to drinking and smoking: study,1,"PARIS, June 16, 2023 (AFP) – People who tend to stay up late are not more likely to die younger than early risers — as long as they don’t use those longer nights for drinking and smoking, a 37-year-long study suggested on Friday.Previous research has shown that night owls, who stay up later and struggle to drag themselves out of bed in the morning, are more likely to suffer from a range of health problems.In 2018, a large study in the UK found that evening people had a 10 percent higher risk of dying than morning people over a 6.5-year period.While that was potentially worrying news for the world’s night owls, that research did not take into account factors, such as alcohol-consumption, that could be behind those deaths.So researchers in Finland sought to find out more in a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Chronobiology International.The study followed nearly 24,000 same-sex twins in Finland, who were asked in 1981 to identify whether they were a morning or an evening person.A third said they were somewhat an evening person, while 10 percent said they definitely were. The rest were morning people.The evening people tended to be younger, and tended to drink and smoke more.When the researchers followed up in 2018, more than 8,700 of the twins had died.Over the 37 years, the researchers found that the definite night owls had a nine percent higher risk of death from all causes — a similar rate to the 2018 study.But that difference was “mainly due to smoking and alcohol”, the study said.For example, it found that non-smoker night owls who were light drinkers were no more likely to die earlier than morning people. The study’s lead author, Christer Hublin of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, told AFP the results showed that night owls can act if they want to lower their risk of an early death.“Clearly evening people should critically think about the amount of alcohol and tobacco they are using,” he said.Independent of other factors, the time when people tend to sleep, known as their chronotype, has “little or no” contribution to their mortality, Hublin added.Jeevan Fernando, a chronotype researcher at Cambridge University not involved in the study, told AFP that while the findings were sound, the research had limitations.That participants merely self-identified as morning or evening people was “unsatisfactory because it does not include any objective information” unlike more modern methods, he said.The study also failed to include drugs other than alcohol and tobacco, he said: cocaine in particular had been linked to people changing from early to late risers.Fernando has previously led research that showed night owls have worse mental health — particularly anxiety — and that drug use could exacerbate the problem."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/positive-results-for-potential-first-chikungunya-vaccine/,Positive results for potential first chikungunya vaccine,1,"PARIS, June 12, 2023 (AFP) — French-Austrian drugmaker Valneva’s vaccine candidate against chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus which causes occasional outbreaks across the world, showed promising results in a large new trial, a study said on Tuesday.While the results were hailed as good news in the fight against chikungunya, the trial was carried out on people in the United States where the virus is extremely rare, with experts saying more research was needed.There are currently no vaccines or treatments available for the virus, which causes fever and sometimes debilitating joint pain, though it is rarely fatal.Valneva says that its vaccine candidate, called VLA1553, is the first to be reviewed by health authorities after applying for approval in the US and Canada.The new randomized, placebo-controlled phase three trial aimed to find out how often the live-attenuated vaccine, which uses a weakened form of the virus, produced an immune response.Out of a subgroup of 266 people who received the vaccine, 263 — 99 percent — developed antibodies that could neutralize the chikungunya virus, according to the study published in The Lancet journal.In a broader trial of 4,100 healthy adults, the single-shot vaccine was deemed “generally safe,” with side effects similar to other vaccines.Only two people developed serious side effects linked to the vaccine, the study said, and both fully recovered.Martina Schneider, Valneva’s clinical strategy manager and the lead author of the study, called the results “promising”.“This could be the first chikungunya vaccine available for people living in endemic regions, as well as for travellers to endemic areas or areas at risk for an upcoming outbreak,” she said in a statement. Public health experts have expressed concerns that chikungunya could be a potential future pandemic threat as climate change pushes the mosquitoes that spread it into new regions.Kathryn Stephenson, an infectious disease specialist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in the US, said the new study was “good news for chikungunya virus pandemic preparedness”.However the vaccine might be less effective in areas with a built-up immunity to chikungunya, which can happen with such live-attenuated shots, she added.Since chikungunya was first identified in Tanzania in 1952, it has been recorded in more than 110 countries, according to the World Health Organization.Occasional but severe outbreaks take place in Africa, Asia and the Americas.Valneva has said the US Food and Drug Administration could make a decision on approving the vaccine at the end of August.The company is also trialing the vaccine among adolescents in areas of Brazil where the virus is endemic.Stephenson said the Brazilian trial and further research conducted during actual chikungunya outbreaks were “crucial” to establishing the vaccine’s effectiveness.A chikungunya vaccine candidate developed by Denmark’s Bavarian Nordic is also undergoing phase three trials."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/cheap-diabetes-drug-reduces-risk-of-long-covid-study/,Cheap diabetes drug reduces risk of long Covid: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — People who took a cheap diabetes drug after testing positive for Covid-19 had a 40 percent lower risk of getting long Covid, a US-based study said Friday.The finding was hailed as a potential “landmark” in the fight against the still little-understood condition, which the World Health Organization estimates affects one in 10 people who get Covid.The study said it was the first randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial — considered the gold standard in research — to show that taking a drug can prevent long Covid.It tested a drug called metformin, which was originally developed from the French lilac flower, and has been the most common medication used to treat type 2 diabetes across the world for decades.This means the drug is known to be safe, as well as being inexpensive and widely available.The study covered 1,126 overweight or obese people in the United States, half receiving metformin and half a placebo in the days after testing positive for Covid.After 10 months, 35 of the participants who took metformin were diagnosed with long Covid, compared to 58 for the placebo group, representing a 40 percent reduction in risk.The trial was conducted between December 2020 and January 2022, meaning it included the Omicron variant, which research has suggested causes long Covid at a lower rate than previous strains.The team behind the COVID-OUT trial had previously shown that metformin reduced coronavirus patients’ risk of emergency department visits, hospitalizations and death by more than 40 percent.Carolyn Bramante, a researcher at the University of Minnesota and the new study’s lead author, told AFP that “our data show that metformin reduces the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus” in patients.The research was published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal. Jeremy Faust, a doctor at Harvard Medical School not involved the study, said in a linked comment piece that if confirmed, the findings “are profound and potentially landmark” for long Covid.Frances Williams, an epidemiology professor at King’s College London, pointed out that 564 people had to take the drug “to prevent 23 hypothetical cases”.“This means 24 people would need to take metformin to prevent one case of long Covid,” she said, adding that this was a lot of drugs to stop such a poorly understood condition.The researchers cautioned that they did not test metformin on people who had already been diagnosed with long Covid, so the findings did not mean it could be used to treat the condition.The study also found that the antiparasitic drug ivermectin, which was the subject of misinformation throughout the pandemic, as well as the antidepressant fluvoxamine did not prevent long Covid.Tens of millions of people have been estimated to have had long Covid, in which numerous and sometimes debilitating symptoms last or recur three months after infection that can then drag on for years.The most common symptoms include fatigue, breathlessness and a lack of mental clarity called brain fog."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/eu-approves-first-vaccine-against-common-respiratory-virus/,EU approves first vaccine against common respiratory virus,1,"LONDON (AFP) — The European Commission has followed the United States in approving the world’s first vaccine for the Respiratory Syncytial Virus, to be used by adults aged 60 and over, its maker GlaxoSmithKline said Wednesday.The United States approved the drug, named Arexvy, last month, while the vaccine is the culmination of a decades-long hunt to protect vulnerable people from the common illness.RSV normally causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but can be serious for infants and the elderly, as well as those with weak immune systems and underlying conditions.In severe cases it can cause pneumonia and bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small airways deep inside the lungs.Analysts predict the market could be worth more than $10 billion in the next decade, with similar shots from other makers including Pfizer and Moderna expected to follow soon.“This authorisation for Arexvy means eligible adults can be vaccinated against RSV disease for the first time,” GSK’s chief scientific officer Tony Wood said in a statement.GSK said RSV is “a common, contagious respiratory virus that leads to… approximately 20,000 in-hospital deaths each year in adults aged 60 years and over in Europe”.The company’s shares traded flat in early London deals following the expected approval announcement.Rates of RSV and flu fell during Covid-19 lockdowns, but surged when restrictions were lifted, with young children hit hard. Stella Kyriakides, EU commissioner for health and food safety, said she hoped the vaccine would prevent problems encountered last winter.“The Covid pandemic clearly showed the need for decisive action to better prepare the EU for emerging health threats,” she said in separate statement.“I now encourage member states to quickly build on this authorisation and define national vaccination strategies so that those most at risk can access them in the coming months ahead of the next autumn season.”The European Union’s drug watchdog in April recommended Arexvy’s approval following a trial on 25,000 participants in 17 countries.The results showed that the vaccine was 83 percent effective at protecting against RSV-related diseases in people aged 60 years or over, with generally mild side effects, according to the European Medicines Agency.The vaccine uses an engineered protein and an adjuvant substance to promote antibodies and T cells that help fight off RSV infection.Moderna hopes its RSV vaccine will be approved and be made available by the end of the year.The EU in 2022 approved a preventative treatment against RSV, developed by British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca and France’s Sanofi, which works similarly to a vaccine."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/treatment-found-to-reduce-progression-of-rare-blood-cancer-by-74/,Treatment found to reduce progression of rare blood cancer by 74%,1,"WASHINGTON, June 5, 2023 (AFP) – A treatment that involves genetically modifying the body’s own immune cells has been found to cut the risk of disease progression by 74 percent in people with a rare type of blood cancer, results showed Monday.Ciltacabtagene autoleucel — also known by its trade name Carvykti — was tested in a clinical trial involving 419 patients with multiple myeloma, whose disease was not responsive to the current frontline drug lenalidomide, a chemotherapy medicine.“Lenalidomide has become a foundation of care for people with myeloma, but as its use has expanded, so has the number of patients whose disease will no longer respond to the treatment,” said oncologist Oreofe Odejide at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting where results were presented.Ciltacabtagene autoleucel “delivers remarkably effective outcomes compared to patients’ current options” and “can be used safely earlier in the treatment phase,” added Odejide, an expert who was not part of the research.Multiple myeloma affects a type of white blood cells called plasma cells, and can cause cascading harms to the bones, kidneys, and immune health.It affects seven people out of 100,000 every year, according to the Cleveland Clinic, with 100,000 people impacted in the United States. There is currently no cure, though progression can be stopped for a long time.Risk increases with age, with men more likely to be affected than women, and Black people at higher risk than other races. Not everyone requires immediate treatment and the disease may be monitored if it is slow growing.In the new clinical trial, half the patients were randomly assigned ciltacabtagene autoleucel, while the other half received a cocktail of drugs that represents the current standard of care, including chemotherapy and steroids.“After a median follow-up of 16 months, the researchers found that ciltacabtagene autoleucel reduced the risk of disease progression by 74 percent, compared with the standard-of-care treatments,” a press statement said.Ciltacabtagene autoleucel is a type of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, a newer form of treatment.CAR T-cell therapy involves removing the patient’s disease fighting T cells, and genetically engineering them in a lab so they have specific proteins known as receptors that, once returned to the body, will seek out and destroy cancer cells.Nearly all the patients in both groups experienced severe to life-threatening adverse events, including infections and low blood cell counts.Three-quarters of patients on ciltacabtagene autoleucel developed Cytokine release syndrome, in which the immune system is sent into overdrive. It can affect multiple organs and cause death.Around five percent of patients on ciltacabtagene autoleucel developed immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), which affects a person’s nervous system.Next, the researchers will continue to follow the study participants to determine long-term effects and impacts on quality of life.The clinical trial was funded by Janssen Research & Development and Legend Biotech USA."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pill-halves-risk-of-death-in-type-of-lung-cancer/,Pill halves risk of death in type of lung cancer,1,"WASHINGTON, June 4, 2023 (AFP) – A pill has been shown to halve the risk of death from a certain type of lung cancer when taken daily after surgery to remove the tumor, according to clinical trial results presented on Sunday.The results were unveiled in Chicago at the largest annual conference of cancer specialists, hosted by the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO).Lung cancer is the form of the disease that causes the most deaths, with approximately 1.8 million fatalities every year worldwide.The treatment developed by the pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca is called osimertinib and is marketed under the name Tagrisso. It targets a particular type of lung cancer in patients suffering from so-called non-small cell cancer, the most common type, and showing a particular type of mutation.These mutations, on what is called the epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, affect 10 percent to 25 percent of lung cancer patients in the United States and Europe, and 30 to 40 percent in Asia.The clinical trial included some 680 participants at an early stage of the disease (stages 1b to 3a), in more than 20 countries. They had to have been operated on first to remove the tumor, then half of the patients took the treatment daily, and the other a placebo.The result showed that taking the tablet resulted in a 51 percent reduction in the risk of death for treated patients, compared to placebo.After five years, 88 percent of patients who took the treatment were still alive, compared to 78 percent of patients who took the placebo.These data are “impressive,” said Roy Herbst of Yale University, who presented them in Chicago. The drug helps “prevent the cancer from spreading to the brain, to the liver, to the bones,” he added at a press conference.About a third of cases of non-small cell cancers can be operated on when detected, he said.“It is hard for me to convey, I think, how important this finding is,” said Nathan Pennell of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation at the press conference.“We started entering the personalized therapy era for early stage patients,” said Pennell, who did not take part in the trials, and noted that “we should firmly close the door on one-size-fits-all treatment for people with non- small cell lung cancer.”Osimertinib is already authorized in dozens of countries for various indications, and has already been given to some 700,000 people, according to a press release from AstraZeneca.Its approval in the United States for early stages in 2020 was based on previous data that showed an improvement in patient disease-free survival, that is, the time a patient lives without a recurrence of cancer.But not all doctors have adopted the treatment, and many were waiting for the data on overall survival that was presented on Sunday, said Herbst.He stressed the need to screen patients to find out if they have the EGFR mutation. Otherwise, he said, “we cannot use this new treatment.”Osimertinib, which targets the receptor, causes side effects that include as severe fatigue, skin rashes or diarrhea."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-members-approve-nearly-7-bn-budget/,WHO members approve nearly $7 bn budget,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization on Monday won basic approval for a $6.83-billion budget over the next two years, including a 20-percent hike in mandatory membership fees.As the UN health agency kicked off its annual decision-making assembly, member states in a key committee approved the budget without objection.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hailed the move as “historic and a big milestone”.The budget still needs to be approved by all the member states at the end of the 10-day event, but this is basically a formality.The decision comes after last year’s assembly agreed to a dramatic overhaul of WHO funding.Shaken by the Covid-19 pandemic, countries agreed on the need to provide more reliable and stable funding.The WHO is largely financed by its 194 member states.The portion of funding from mandatory membership fees — “assessed contributions” calculated according to wealth and population — had dwindled to below one-fifth, with the rest coming from “voluntary contributions”.This left WHO with limited leeway to respond to crises like Covid-19, the war in Ukraine and other health emergencies.Last year’s assembly agreed to gradually increase the membership fee portion to 50 percent by the 2030-31 budget cycle at the latest.The 2024-25 budget cycle marks the first incremental increase, with countries agreeing to hike their assessed contributions by 20 percent from the 2022-23 budget.In return for the funding shift, WHO has begun implementing 96 reforms, including towards more transparency on its financing and hiring and broader accountability.Tedros told the assembly earlier Monday that WHO so far had implemented 42 of the requested reforms “and 54 are ongoing."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-returns-to-strike-peloton-ahead-of-giro/,Covid returns to strike peloton ahead of Giro,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Two days before the start of the Giro d’Italia, Covid-19 has returned to haunt the peloton, causing several riders to withdraw after testing positive, including three from the Jumbo-Visma team of Primoz Roglic.On Thursday, Jumbo-Visma announced a third positive case with Jos van Emden being forced to step down.The Dutchman was one of the two riders, along with Rohan Dennis, who had been called up 24 hours earlier to replace Robert Gesink and Tobias Foss, who were had been hit by the virus.Van Emden will be replaced in turn by Sam Oomen but it is another blow for Roglic, one of the race favorites.“It’s obviously not ideal but we’re going to deal with it and we’re going to find solutions,” said the Slovenian who has won three stages on the Giro but never the general classification, his best performance a third place finish in 2019.“We’ll do our best to stay healthy and make it to the end of these three weeks. We need a bit of luck too,” he added.The Bahrain team also announced on Thursday the withdrawal of one of its leaders, Swiss rider Gino Mader who was also ruled out of the last Tour de France because of Covid.Another of the race favorites Remco Evenepoel said it was “always scary to see several riders sidelined because of an illness, especially Covid-19”.“I think we’re going to do what we did in the last Vuelta,” the Belgian added. “Wear masks, be a little more careful, wash our hands more often to prevent the virus from spreading.”A spokesman for the organizers, however, told AFP that there is “no special protocol for the Giro at the moment”.Britain’s Geraint Thomas, winner of the Tour de France in 2018 and one of the outsiders in this Giro, was unperturbed by the new cases.“I’m not particularly worried,” said the Welshman who will lead the Ineos challenge.“It’s been like this for a few years now. In the team, we’re super careful but we can’t control everything. That’s how it is, that’s life.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-becomes-first-country-to-approve-rsv-vaccine/,US becomes first country to approve RSV vaccine,1,"WASHINGTON, May 3, 2023 (AFP) – The United States on Wednesday approved the world’s first vaccine for the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), the culmination of a decades-long hunt to protect vulnerable people from the common illness.Drugmaker GSK’s Arexvy was green-lighted for adults aged 60 and older, with similar shots from other makers including Pfizer and Moderna expected to follow soon.“Today’s approval of the first RSV vaccine is an important public health achievement to prevent a disease which can be life-threatening,” said senior US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official Peter Marks in a statement.The decision “marks a turning point in our effort to reduce the significant burden of RSV,” added Tony Wood, GSK’s chief scientific officer.RSV is a common virus that normally causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but can be serious for infants and the elderly, as well as those with weak immune systems and underlying conditions.In severe cases it can cause pneumonia and bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small airways deep inside the lungs.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, RSV leads to approximately 60,000 to 120,000 hospitalizations and 6,000 to 10,000 deaths among adults 65 years of age and older.Awareness of the disease has increased in recent years, in part because of the strain it has placed on hospital systems over the last two winters.Rates of RSV and flu fell during Covid-19 lockdowns, but surged when restrictions were lifted, with young children hit hard.Pharmaceutical companies have been chasing an RSV vaccine for years. Given recent successful breakthroughs in the sector, analysts predict the market could be worth over $10 billion in the next decade, according to reports. GSK’s vaccine contains a “subunit” or part of the virus to help train the immune system should it encounter the real thing.It was approved based on a study of 25,000 people aged 60 and older that showed a single dose was 83 percent effective against disease caused by RSV, and more than 94 percent effective against severe disease.Researchers will continue to follow volunteers in the study to assess the duration of protection as well as the safety and efficacy of more doses.The most common side effects included injection site pain, fatigue, muscle pain, headaches and joint stiffness.An irregular heartbeat was a less common side effect, occurring in 10 participants who received Arexvy and four participants who received placebo.Safety issues were also found in two other studies of the drug involving approximately 2,500 people aged 60 and up. In one of these studies, two volunteers developed a rare type of inflammation that affects the brain and spinal cord, and one of them died.In the other study, one participant developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, in which the immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis.GSK’s Arexvy was recommended for approval last week by the European Union’s drug watchdog, the European Medicines Agency, whose positive opinions are normally formally followed by approval from the European Commission.Pfizer has said that it expects a decision from the FDA in May for its own RSV vaccine, also for those over 60 years old.In January, Moderna said it hopes its RSV vaccine will be approved and available in time for the Northern Hemisphere’s winter later this year.Several other companies are also developing RSV vaccines.Last year, the EU approved a preventative antibody treatment against RSV, developed by British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca and France’s Sanofi, which confers temporary protection."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-vaccines-do-not-cause-major-menstrual-issues-study/,Covid vaccines do not cause major menstrual issues: study,1,"Paris, France (AFP) Getting vaccinated against Covid-19 does not make women more likely to seek medical attention for menstrual problems, the largest study conducted on the subject said on Thursday. Since Covid vaccination campaigns began nearly two and a half years ago, some women have reported changes in their menstrual cycle after getting the mRNA shots from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.This led to the European Union’s drug watchdog recommending that heavy periods be listed as a possible side effect of the vaccines.It has also been greatly exaggerated by anti-vaccine campaigners seeking to spread misinformation online about the supposed dangers of getting inoculated, according to experts.The new study looked at patient data from Sweden’s health registry which included nearly three million women, around 40 percent of the country’s female population.Rickard Ljung, a professor at the Swedish Medical Products Agency and lead author of the new study, told AFP that it was “by far” the largest carried out on the issue.It was also the first to use independent data on whether women contacted healthcare professionals over their menstrual problems, he said.Previous research has used self-reported data — including information from apps that track periods — to indicate that some women have changes in their menstrual cycle after getting vaccinated.“What we show is that it does not seem that these (potential) disturbances are so severe that they have led to the women seeking medical attention,” Ljung said.The researchers acknowledged that self-reported data could include menstrual problems which were not quite bad enough for patients to seek help but were still “sufficiently disturbing”.They also pointed out that self-reported data can be “stimulated by media attention”.The study looked at first, second and third doses of the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines in Swedish women aged 12-74 from December 2020 to February 2022.For women who had not yet been through menopause, there was no link between vaccination and menstrual disturbances once variables had been adjusted for, the study said.For post-menopausal women, there was a slight increase in seeking medical attention for menstrual problems after the third dose of Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccine.However, the study said the link between the two factors was “weak and inconsistent”.Overall, the study, published in the BMJ journal, said its “findings do not provide substantial support for a causal association” between Covid vaccines and seeking medical attention for menstrual or bleeding disorders."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/costa-rican-sloth-antibiotics-offer-hope-for-human-medicine/,Costa Rican sloth antibiotics offer hope for human medicine,1,"CAHUITA, Costa Rica (AFP) — The fur of Costa Rican sloths appears to harbor antibiotic-producing bacteria that scientists hope may hold a solution to the growing problem of “superbugs” resistant to humanity’s dwindling arsenal of drugs.Sloth fur, research has found, hosts bustling communities of insects, algae, fungi and bacteria, among other microbes, some of which could pose disease risk.Yet, experts say, the famously slow-moving mammals appear to be surprisingly infection-proof.“If you look at the sloth’s fur, you see movement: you see moths, you see different types of insects… a very extensive habitat,” Max Chavarria, a researcher at the University of Costa Rica, told AFP.“Obviously when there is co-existence of many types of organisms, there must also be systems that control them,” he said.Chavarria and a team took fur samples from Costa Rican two- and three-toed sloths to examine what that control system could be.They found the possible existence of antibiotic-producing bacteria that “makes it possible to control the proliferation of potentially pathogenic bacteria… or inhibit other competitors” such as fungi, according to a study published in the journal Environmental Microbiology. The sloth is a national symbol in laid back Costa Rica, and a major tourist attraction for the Central American country.Both the two-toed (Choloepus Hoffmanni) and three-toed (Bradypus variegatus) sloth species have seen their populations decline, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species.They live in the canopies of trees in the jungle on the Caribbean coast, where the climate is hot and humid.American Judy Avey runs a sanctuary in the balmy jungle to care for sloths injured after coming into contact with humans or other animals.She treats and rehabilitates the creatures with a view to releasing them back into the wild.“We’ve never received a sloth that has been sick, that has a disease or has an illness,” she told AFP.“We’ve received sloths that had been burned by power lines and their entire arm is just destroyed… and there’s no infection.“I think maybe in the 30 years (we’ve been open), we’ve seen five animals that have come in with an infected injury. So that tells us there’s something going on in their… bodily ecosystem.”Avey, who established the sanctuary with her late Costa Rican husband, Luis Arroyo, had never even heard of a sloth back home in Alaska.Since receiving her first sloth, whom she named “Buttercup,” in 1992, she has cared for around 1,000 animals. Researcher Chavarria took fur samples taken from sloths at the sanctuary to examine in his laboratory.He began his research in 2020, and has already pinpointed 20 “candidate” microorganisms waiting to be named.But he said there is a long road ahead in determining whether the sloth compounds could be useful to humans.“Before thinking about an application in human health, it’s important to first understand… what type of molecules are involved,” said Chavarria.An example of this is penicillin, discovered in 1928 by British scientist Alexander Fleming, who discovered that a fungal contamination of a laboratory culture appeared to kill a disease-causing bacteria.His discovery of the world’s first bacteria-killer, or antibiotic, earned him the 1945 Nobel Prize in medicine.However, microbial resistance to antibiotics has been a growing problem, meaning some medicines no longer work to fight the infections they were designed to treat.Antimicrobial resistance is a natural phenomenon, but the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in humans, animals and plants has made the problem worse.The World Health Organization estimates that by 2050, resistance to antibiotics could cause 10 million deaths a year.“Projects like ours can contribute to finding… new molecules that can, in the medium or long term, be used in this battle against antibiotic resistance,” said Chavarria.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/67-million-children-missed-out-on-vaccines-because-of-covid-unicef/,67 million children missed out on vaccines because of Covid: UNICEF,1,"United Nations, United States (AFP) Some 67 million children partially or fully missed routine vaccines globally between 2019 and 2021 because of lockdowns and health care disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the United Nations said Wednesday. “More than a decade of hard-earned gains in routine childhood immunization have been eroded,” read a new report from the UN’s children’s agency, UNICEF, adding that getting back on track “will be challenging.”Of the 67 million children whose vaccinations were “severely disrupted,” 48 million missed out on routine vaccines entirely, UNICEF said, flagging concerns about potential polio and measles outbreaks.Vaccine coverage among children declined in 112 countries and the percent of children vaccinated worldwide slipped 5 points to 81 percent — a low not seen since 2008. Africa and South Asia were particularly hard hit.“Worryingly, the backsliding during the pandemic came at the end of a decade when, in broad terms, growth in childhood immunization had stagnated,” the report said.Vaccines save 4.4 million lives each year, a number the United Nations figures could jump to 5.8 million by 2030 if its ambitious targets to leave “no one behind” are met. “Vaccines have played a really important role in allowing more children to live healthy, long lives,” Brian Keeley, the report’s editor in chief, told AFP. “Any decline at all in vaccination rates is worrying.” Before the introduction of a vaccine in 1963, measles killed approximately 2.6 million people each year, mostly children. By 2021, that number had fallen to 128,000.But between 2019 and 2021, the percentage of children vaccinated against measles fell from 86 percent to 81 percent, and the number of cases in 2022 doubled compared to 2021. The slide in vaccination rates could be compounded by other crises, Keeley warned, from climate change to food insecurity.“You’ve got increasing number of conflicts, economic stagnation in a lot of countries, climate emergencies, and so on,” he said. “This all sort of makes it harder and harder for health systems and countries to meet vaccination needs.” UNICEF called on governments “to double-down on their commitment to increase financing for immunization” with special attention on accelerating “catch-up” vaccination efforts for those who missed their shots.The report also raised concerns about a drop in people’s confidence in vaccines, seen in 52 out of 55 countries surveyed.“We cannot allow confidence in routine immunizations to become another victim of the pandemic,” Catherine Russell, UNICEF’s executive director, said in a statement. “Otherwise, the next wave of deaths could be of more children with measles, diphtheria or other preventable diseases.”Vaccine confidence can be “volatile and time specific,” the report said, noting that “further analysis will be required to determine if the findings are indicative of a longer-term trend” beyond the pandemic. Overall, it said that support for vaccines “remains relatively strong.”In about half of the 55 countries surveyed, more than 80 percent of respondents “perceived vaccines as important for children.”“There is reason to be somewhat hopeful that services are recovering in quite a few countries,” said Keeley, who added that preliminary vaccination data from 2022 showed encouraging signs.But even getting numbers back up to pre-pandemic levels will take years, he said, not including reaching “the children who were missing before the pandemic.” “And they are not an insubstantial number.”"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-approves-sale-of-anti-overdose-drug-narcan-without-prescription/,US approves sale of anti-overdose drug Narcan without prescription,1,", The US drug regulator announced Wednesday that Narcan, the treatment which reverses overdoses, can be distributed without prescription, a move that comes as the country battles an acute opioid addiction crisis.The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) said that four milligram nasal spray doses of naloxone hydrochloride, the generic name for Narcan, can be sold over the counter almost anywhere, from pharmacies to supermarkets to gas stations.The FDA said they moved to address to mounting toll from opioid use, especially the synthetic and relatively easily made fentanyl, which has in the past five years increasingly replaced heroin and prescription pain killers as the main drug used by people addicted to opioids.In the 12 months to October 2022, the US recorded 101,750 overdose deaths, mostly from fentanyl, the FDA said in a statement.“The agency has used its regulatory authority to facilitate greater access to naloxone by encouraging the development of and approving an over-the-counter naloxone product to address the dire public health need,” said FDA Commissioner Robert Califf.Narcan, by far the most commonly used version of naloxone, can quickly reverse the effects of an overdose.Narcan will “bring someone back from basically the dead,” Johnny Bailey, who has recovered from an opioid addiction and who trains people to administer the drug, explained in early March in Washington.Previously administered mainly by injection, Narcan, produced by Emergent BioSolutions, was approved in its nasal spray form as a prescription drug in 2015.With the toll from overdoses mounting each year, the FDA accelerated its review of Narcan for over-the-counter sales early this year.The FDA said other producers of naloxone spray can gain approval on a case-by-case basis.“Naloxone is a critical tool in addressing opioid overdoses,” said FDA drug evaluation chief Patrizia Cavazzoni.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-says-medium-risk-adults-dont-need-extra-covid-jabs/,WHO says medium-risk adults don’t need extra Covid jabs,1,"by Robin MILLARDThe World Health Organization said Tuesday it is no longer recommending additional Covid-19 vaccine booster doses for regular, medium-risk adults as the benefit was marginal.For such people who have received their primary vaccination course and one booster dose, there is no risk in having further jabs but the returns are slight, the WHO’s vaccine experts said.The UN health agency’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) issued updated recommendations after its regular biannual meeting.SAGE’s new advice reflects the impact of the dominant Omicron variant of the virus and high-level immunity now achieved in the population through infection and vaccination, the WHO said.SAGE came up with three new, simplified priority categories for Covid vaccination: high, medium and low, based on risk of severe disease or death.SAGE recommended additional booster shots after the first one only for people at the highest risk of developing severe Covid-19 disease.They include older adults; younger adults with comorbidities such as diabetes, people with immunocompromising conditions like HIV, pregnant women, and frontline health workers.The medium priority group includes healthy adults, usually under 60, and children and adolescents with comorbidities.SAGE recomends a primary series and a first booster dose.“When it comes to the medium-risk group, additional booster doses… are no longer recommended,” said SAGE chair Hanna Nohynek.“The vaccine is safe and it’s efficient against serious disease and death,” she said, but for this risk group, while there was no harm in having another shot, “the benefit of these additional boosters is actually quite marginal”.The low priority group includes healthy children and adolescents aged six months to 17 years.While primary and booster doses are safe and effective for this group, considering the low burden of Covid disease, SAGE said countries’ vaccination decisions should be based “on contextual factors” such as health programme priorities and cost effectiveness.As for the impact of Covid-19 vaccines on Long Covid, or post-infection conditions, “the evidence on the extent of their impact is inconsistent”, said SAGE.Nearly 13.3 billion Covid vaccine doses have been administered around the world.WHO vaccines chief Kate O’Brien said that versus Omicron, the existing vaccines provide very good immunity against severe disease, but “frankly they don’t last very long for the performance that they do have against mild disease or infection”.The WHO is looking for new Covid vaccines that cover a broad spectrum of variants, have longer durability and better performance against infection and transmission.It is also seeking vaccines that are move on from injection methods and ultra cold chain storage, O’Brien said, citing nasal, oral and skin patch vaccine methods.Speaking of two nasally-administered vaccines, particularly one being used in China, SAGE executive secretary Joachim Hombach said: “We know that they are immunogenic… but what we really need is data that actually studies the impact on transmission — because that could indeed make a major difference.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/all-hormonal-contraceptives-increase-breast-cancer-risk-study/,All hormonal contraceptives increase breast cancer risk: study,1,"Washington, United States (AFP)All hormonal contraceptives carry a slightly increased risk of breast cancer, including the increasingly popular progestogen-only pills, according to a study published on Tuesday.The researchers who carried out the study stressed that the increased risk of breast cancer needs to be weighed against the benefits of hormonal contraceptives, including the protection they provide against other forms of female cancer.Previous studies have established an increased risk of breast cancer from two-hormone, or combined, contraceptives that use both estrogen and progestogen.While the use of progestogen-only contraceptives has been on the rise for well over a decade, little research had been performed previously on their links to breast cancer.The study, published in the journal PLOS Medicine, found that the risk of a woman developing breast cancer was about the same for hormonal contraceptives using both estrogen and progestogen as for those using just progestogen.According to the study, women taking hormonal contraceptives have a 20 to 30 percent higher risk of developing breast cancer than those who do not use them.The findings are similar to those published previously, including in a vast 1996 study.The risk remains about the same regardless of the delivery method — oral pill, IUD, implant or injection — or whether it is a combined pill or progestogen alone.Taking into account that the likelihood of breast cancer increases with age, the authors of the study calculated how much absolute excess risk is associated with hormonal contraceptives.For women taking hormonal contraceptives for a period of five years between the ages of 16 to 20, it represented eight cases of breast cancer per 100,000, they said.Between 35 and 39 years old, it was 265 cases per 100,000. “Nobody wants to hear that something that they’re taking is going to increase their risk of breast cancer by 25 percent,” said Gillian Reeves, a professor of statistical epidemiology at the University of Oxford and a co-author of the study.“What we’re talking about here is very small increase in absolute risk,” Reeves said.“These increases in risk for breast cancer have to, of course, be viewed in the context of what we know about the many benefits of taking hormonal contraceptives,” she added.“Not just in terms of birth control, but also because we know that oral contraceptives actually provide quite substantial and long term protection from other female cancers, such as ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer.”The study also confirmed, like others, that the risk of breast cancer declines in the years after a woman stops using hormonal contraceptives.Stephen Duffy, a professor at Queen Mary University of London who did not take part in the study, described the findings as “reassuring in that the effect is modest.”The study involved data from nearly 10,000 women under the age of 50 who developed breast cancer between 1996 and 2017 in the United Kingdom, where the use of progestogen-only contraceptives is now as widespread as the combined method.Reeves said there were several explanations for the growing use of progestogen-only contraceptives.They are recommended for women who are breast-feeding, who may be at risk of cardiovascular problems or smokers above the age of 35.“It might just be because women are taking hormonal contraceptives possibly into later years now,” Reeves said.“So they are naturally at higher risk of those other conditions for which risk is increased with combined contraceptives.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/lacking-health-workers-germany-taps-robots-for-elder-care/,Lacking health workers,1,"Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany (AFP) — The white-coloured humanoid “Garmi” does not look much different from a typical robot — it stands on a platform with wheels and is equipped with a black screen on which two blue circles acting as eyes are attached.But retired German doctor Guenter Steinebach, 78, said: “For me, this robot is a dream.”Not only is Garmi able to perform diagnostics on patients, it can also provide care and treatment for them. Or at least, that is the plan. Garmi is a product of a new sector called geriatronics, a discipline that taps advanced technologies like robotics, IT and 3D technology for geriatrics, gerontology and nursing.About a dozen scientists built Garmi with the help of medical practitioners like Steinebach at the Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence.Part of the Technical University of Munich, the institute based its unit specialising in geriatronics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, a ski resort that is home to one of the highest proportion of elderly people in Germany.Europe’s most populous country is itself one of the world’s most rapidly ageing societies.With the number of people needing care growing quickly and an estimated 670,000 carer posts to go unfilled in Germany by 2050, the researchers are racing to conceive robots that can take over some of the tasks carried out today by nurses, carers and doctors.“We have ATMs where we can get cash today. We can imagine that one day, based on the same model, people can come to get their medical examination in a kind of technology hub,” said Abdeldjallil Naceri, 43, the lead scientist of the lab.Doctors could then evaluate the results of the robot’s diagnostics from a distance, something that could be particularly valuable for people living in remote communities. Alternatively the machine could offer a more personalised service at home or in a care home — by serving meals, opening a bottle of water, calling for help in case of a fall or organising a video call with family and friends. In the Garmisch laboratory, Steinebach sat down at a table equipped with three screens and a joystick as he got ready to test the robot’s progress.At the other end of the room, a researcher designated as a test model took his spot in front of Garmi, which poses a stethoscope on his chest — an action directed by Steinebach from afar via the joystick.Medical data immediately appear on the doctor’s screen.“Imagine if I had had that in my old practice,” Steinebach said, while moving the joystick. Besides the retired doctor, other medical practitioners also visit the lab regularly to offer their ideas and feedback on the robot.“It’s like a three-year-old child. We have to teach it everything,” Naceri said.It’s anyone’s guess when Garmi might be ready on a commercial scale.But Naceri is convinced that “we must get there, the statistics are clear that it is urgent”. “From 2030, we must be able to integrate this kind of technology in our society.” And if it is indeed deployed one day, residents of the Sankt Vinzenz retirement home in Garmisch, a partner of the project, will likely see Garmi whizzing down the corridors.Just thinking about it made Mrs Rohrer, a 74-year-old resident at the home, smile.“There are things that a robot can do, for example, serve a drink or bring meals,” she said as Eva Pioskowik, the director of the home, did her nails. Pioskowik, who battles with staffing shortages on a daily basis, said she did not expect the robot to take the place of health workers. “But it could allow our staff to spend a bit more time with the residents,” she said.For Naceri’s team, one of the major challenges is not technological, medical or financial. Rather, it remains to be seen if most patients will accept the robot.“They need to trust the robot,” he said. “They need to be able to use it like we use a smartphone today.”"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/drugs-from-the-deep-scientists-explore-ocean-frontiers/,Health warnings as Bangkok chokes on pollution,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Some send divers in speed boats, others dispatch submersible robots to search the seafloor, and one team deploys a “mud missile” — all tools used by scientists to scour the world’s oceans for the next potent cancer treatment or antibiotic.A medicinal molecule could be found in microbes scooped up in sediment, be produced by porous sponges or sea squirts — barrel-bodied creatures that cling to rocks or the undersides of boats — or by bacteria living symbiotically in a snail.But once a compound reveals potential for the treatment of, say, Alzheimer’s or epilepsy, developing it into a drug typically takes a decade or more, and costs hundreds of millions of dollars.“Suppose you want to cure cancer — how do you know what to study?” said William Fenical, a professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, considered a pioneer in the hunt for marine-derived medicines.“You don’t.”With tight budgets and little support from big pharma, scientists often piggyback on other research expeditions.Marcel Jaspars of Scotland’s University of Aberdeen said colleagues collect samples by dropping a large metal tube on a 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) cable that “rams” the seafloor. A more sophisticated method uses small, remotely operated underwater vehicles.“I say to people, all I really want is a tube of mud,” he told AFP.This small but innovative area of marine exploration is in the spotlight at crucial UN high seas treaty negotiations, covering waters beyond national jurisdiction, which could wrap up this week with new rules governing marine protected areas crucial for protecting biodiversity.Nations have long tussled over how to share benefits from marine genetic resources in the open ocean — including compounds used in medicines, bioplastics and food stabilizers, said Daniel Kachelriess, a High Seas Alliance co-lead on the issue at the negotiations.And yet only a small number of products with marine genetic resources find their way onto the market, with just seven recorded in 2019, he said. The value of potential royalties has been estimated at $10 million to $30 million a year.But the huge biological diversity of the oceans means there is likely much more to be discovered.“The more we look, the more we find,” said Jaspars, whose lab specializes in compounds from the world’s extreme environments, like underwater hydrothermal vents and polar regions. Since Alexander Fleming discovered a bacteria-repelling mold he called penicillin in 1928, researchers have studied and synthesized chemical compounds made by mostly land-based plants, animals, insects and microbes to treat human disease.“The vast majority of the antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs come from natural sources,” Fenical told AFP, adding that when he started out in 1973, people were skeptical that the oceans had something to offer.In one early breakthrough in the mid-1980s, Fenical and colleagues discovered a type of sea whip — a soft coral — growing on reefs in the Bahamas that produced a molecule with anti-inflammatory properties.It caught the eye of cosmetics firm Estee Lauder, which helped develop it for use in its product at the time.But the quantities of sea whips needed to research and market the compound ultimately led Fenical to abandon marine animals and instead focus on microorganisms.Researchers scoop sediment from the ocean floor and then grow the microbes they find in the lab.In 1991 Fenical and his colleagues found a previously-unknown marine bacterium called Salinispora in the mud off the coast of the Bahamas.More than a decade of work yielded two anti-cancer drugs, one for lung cancer and the other for the untreatable brain tumor glioblastoma. Both are in the final stages of clinical trials.Fenical — who at 81 still runs a lab at Scripps — said researchers were thrilled to have got this far, but the excitement is tempered by caution.“You never know if something is going to be really good, or not at all useful,” he said. That long pipeline is no surprise to Carmen Cuevas Marchante, head of research and development at the Spanish biotech firm PharmaMar.For their first drug, they started out by cultivating and collecting some 300 tons of the bulbous sea squirt.“From one ton we could isolate less than one gram” of the compound they needed for clinical trials, she told AFP.The company now has three cancer drugs approved, all derived from sea squirts, and has fine-tuned its methods for making synthetic versions of natural compounds.Even if everything goes right, Marchante said, it can take 15 years between discovery and having a product to market.Overall, there have been 17 marine-derived drugs approved to treat human disease since 1969, with some 40 in various stages of clinical trials around the world, according to the online tracker Marine Drug Pipeline.Those already on the market include a herpes antiviral from a sponge and a powerful pain drug from a cone snail, but most treat cancer.That, experts say, is partly because the huge costs of clinical trials — potentially topping a billion dollars — favors the development of more expensive drugs.But there is a “myriad” of early-stage research on marine-derived compounds for anything from malaria to tuberculosis, said Alejandro Mayer, a pharmacology professor at Illinois’ Midwestern University who runs the Marine Pipeline project and whose own specialty is the brain’s immune system.That means there is still huge potential to find the next antibiotic or HIV therapy, scientists say.It might be produced by a creature buried in ocean sediment or quietly clinging to a boat’s hull.Or it could be already in our possession: laboratories around the world hold libraries of compounds that can be tested against new diseases.“There’s a whole new frontier out there,” said Fenical.© Agence France-Presse"

Hey everyone! It’s my eighth birthday!” said a beaming Panghegar Bhumi in a video in September, while making a heart-shaped gesture with his arms.A month later he died from acute kidney injury, days after a doctor prescribed him a cough syrup containing ingredients that have been linked to more than 200 child deaths in Indonesia, according to the country’s health ministry.“I whispered in his ears: ‘The medicine is coming, please hang in there a little bit more’,” Rani said, crying in her home in West Java province as she recalled the final days of her son’s life.“But I lied, there was no medicine.”The 42-year-old mother is among more than two dozen Indonesian families seeking justice for their children, whom they allege were either killed or sickened by contaminated cough syrups.Their class-action lawsuit targets the country’s health ministry, food and drug agency, and eight companies they accuse of selling the syrups — which the World Health Organization said contain an “unacceptable amount” of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol.“These contaminants are toxic chemicals used as industrial solvents and antifreeze agents that can be fatal even taken in small amounts, and should never be found in medicines,” the WHO said in January.Since October last year, the WHO has issued alerts for The Gambia, Indonesia and Uzbekistan over syrups containing the two chemicals.Five-year-old Farrazka was required to undergo dialysis for his failing kidneys after he took one of the medicines, his mother Indah Septian told AFP.“When I heard that he had to have dialysis, I was so confused and did not know what to do. He is just a kid,” Septian said at her home.“Now he gets easily fatigued even when he only does a bit of activity,” the 31-year-old said.But Septian and her husband Riski Agri consider themselves luckier than other families.“Until today I still wake up in the middle of the night and check on him. We almost lost him,” 34-year-old Agri said. Since the government sounded the alarm in October, Indonesia’s food and drug agency has recalled 105 products after tests revealed excessive amounts of the two chemicals.It has also revoked the licenses of six pharmaceutical firms.Police have launched an investigation into five companies and arrested four suspects.But the plaintiffs say that is not enough.“From the beginning, this case was not considered a priority,” said Awan Puryadi, the lawyer representing the families.“All of the victims who are still alive, and are still being treated, must all be covered by the government for the rest of their lives.”They are seeking compensation of 2 billion rupiah ($131,000) for every person killed and 1 billion rupiah for every person injured.In a hearing last month, parents wore black shirts that read “I thought it was medicine, it was poison”.The next hearing is scheduled for March 9.One of the accused companies in the lawsuit contacted by AFP denied putting the chemicals in its cough syrups and blamed a distributor for any contamination.Indonesia’s drug regulator, like the WHO, says the chemicals should never be used in syrup medicines because they can be toxic for humans.But it says in the event of contamination during production, the chemicals can be consumed safely up to a level of 0.1 milligrams per milliliter.Four other companies named in the lawsuit did not respond to a request for comment and AFP was not able to reach three firms. The seven have not commented publicly on the lawsuit or the allegations. Without compensation, the injured children’s parents face treatment costs that many cannot afford.Eighteen-month-old Raivan was unable to move after he consumed cough syrup prescribed by a paediatrician in May, said his mother Resti Safriti.He is now fed through a tube, and breathes through another in his neck.In the hopes of replicating physical therapy techniques, his parents resort to rocking him on an exercise ball in their Jakarta home.“We could not afford therapy, so we do what we can with what we have at home,” Resti said.Resti and her husband had to leave their jobs to take care of him, and she begged the government to “fix the system” that has led to her child’s suffering.“Don’t let other parents and children go through this,” she said. “What if this happened to your own child?”© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/brisk-daily-walk-could-prevent-one-in-10-early-deaths-study/,Vaccine maker Novavax says ‘substantial doubt’ over future,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — One in 10 early deaths could be prevented if everyone engaged in a small amount of daily exercise such as a brisk 11-minute walk, a large study said on Wednesday.Physical activity is known to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer and other leading causes of death, but exactly how much is needed to have an impact has been unclear.So an international team of researchers pooled together the results of 196 previous studies which included more than 30 million people to create one of the largest reviews conducted on the subject.They calculated that around one in six early deaths would have been prevented if everyone in the studies had at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity, which is the level recommended by Britain’s National Health Service.But even half that amount — 75 minutes a week, or less than 11 minutes a day — could prevent one in 10 of those deaths, according to the meta-analysis published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.That included a 17-percent reduction of heart disease and a seven-percent fall in cancer.For a person who engages in little to no physical activity, 11 minutes a day led to a 23-percent lower risk of early death.Soren Brage, an expert on the epidemiology of physical activity at Britain’s Cambridge University and a co-author of the study, told AFP that it was “exceptionally good news”.“All you need to do is find a little bit more than 10 minutes every day,” he said.“And you don’t have to go to the gym to do these types of activities, it’s part of daily life,” he added.He suggested people try getting off at an earlier bus stop on the way to work — or cycling home.“It’s very flexible,” he said.Because it takes years to assess how exercise affects the risk of such diseases, many of the studies were carried out more than a decade ago, Brage said.This means that the activity reported by the study participants was likely less accurate than what can be achieved by newer technologies such as fitness trackers, Brage said, acknowledging this was a limitation of the study.Cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke killed 17.9 million people globally in 2019, while cancer accounted for nearly 10 million deaths the following year, according to the World Health Organization.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/vaccine-misinformation/,Vaccine misinformation spawns ‘pure blood’ movement,1,"Washington, United States (AFP) — Vaccine skeptics blocking transfusions for life-saving surgeries, Facebook groups inciting violence against doctors and a global search for unvaccinated donors — Covid-19 misinformation has bred a so-called “pure blood” movement. Some have advocated for blood banks that draw from “pure” unvaccinated people, while medics in North America say they have fielded requests from people demanding transfusions from donors who have not received the jab.In closed social media groups, vaccine skeptics — who brand themselves as “pure bloods” — promote violence against doctors administering coronavirus jabs alongside false claims of mass deaths of vaccinated people.Taking the hysteria to the next level was the recent high-profile case of a New Zealand couple, who sought to block life-saving heart surgery of their infant on the grounds that any blood transfused could have come from a vaccinated donor.Their stance prompted a New Zealand court to take temporary custody of the baby to allow the procedure, but the case became a cause celebre among vaccine skeptics around the world.“Cases like this spread like wildfire on both fringe and mainstream news sites and then social media, providing attention for anti-vaccine conspiracy theories,” Katrine Wallace, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Illinois Chicago, told AFP.“There is absolutely no science behind these conspiracies. If you give blood from a vaccinated donor to an unvaccinated person, the person receiving the transfusion does not become vaccinated.” George Della Pietra, a Swiss naturopath founded Safe Blood Donation, a global mediation service that falsely labels mRNA coronavirus vaccines a “health threat” and seeks to connect unvaccinated blood donors with recipients.The Zurich-based nonprofit offers to obtain “fresh or canned” unvaccinated blood for its patrons, according to Safe Blood’s website, which says it has a presence across western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, Asia and Africa.AFP’s email to Pietra requesting comment elicited a reply from Safe Blood’s media director.“There are a large number of scientists and doctors who not only have great concerns about the Covid vaccines, but are convinced that they also enter the body via the blood through the back door, so to speak, and remain there,” wrote Clinton Ohlers, the media director, quoting from the website.That directly contradicts scientific assertions.“Blood donations from individuals who have received a Covid-19 vaccine are safe for transfusion,” Jessa Merrill, from the American Red Cross, told AFP.“Similar to other vaccines… the Covid-19 vaccine is designed to generate an immune response to help protect an individual from illness, but vaccine components themselves are not found within the bloodstream.”Safe Blood’s members are required to pay an initial joining fee of 50 euros ($54), followed by 20 euros each subsequent year, according to its website.“The ‘safe blood’ movement is absolutely based 100 percent in anti-vaccine misinformation,” said Wallace.“As with all anti-vaccine misinformation, appealing to people’s fears is sadly profitable.”– Sperm and breast milk – The demand to remain “pure” reaches beyond blood to social media posts soliciting sperm from unvaccinated men — conspiracy theorists speculate online that the precious commodity will be the “next Bitcoin” — as well as breast milk from unvaccinated mothers. These requests appear to stem from belief in the debunked claims that Covid vaccines can cause infertility or alter the human DNA.Demand for “unvaccinated” blood is unclear, but experts say it would be a challenge to procure it in countries with high vaccination rates.The Food and Drug Administration in the United States, where more than 80 percent of the population has received at least one Covid jab, says it does not require blood collectors to test for vaccination status.Hospitals are also not able to inform the status of donated blood to patients. “Is the US blood supply tainted?” screamed a headline from Children’s Health Defense, a nonprofit founded by Robert Kennedy Jr, a known purveyor of vaccine misinformation.It falsely asserted that the country’s vaccination campaign may have “contaminated the country’s blood supply.”An AFP reporter who infiltrated one of the closed “pure bloods” Facebook groups found posts vilifying doctors administering vaccines as “an arm of the state.”Other posts contained a cartoon image of a nurse holding a syringe and standing in a field full of skulls, and another of “victims” tumbling out of a vaccine bottle in crutches and wheelchairs.Another post contained a video of a shirtless muscular man headbutting and smashing a car window in what was claimed to be a public outburst against vaccines."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/world-dangerously-unprepared-for-next-crisis-red-cross/,World ‘dangerously unprepared’ for next crisis: Red Cross,1,", by Robin MILLARDAll countries remain “dangerously unprepared” for the next pandemic, the Red Cross warned on Monday, saying future health crises could also collide with increasingly likely climate-related disasters.Despite three “brutal” years of the Covid-19 pandemic, strong preparedness systems are “severely lacking”, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said.The world’s largest humanitarian network said building trust, equity and local action networks were vital to get ready for the next crisis.“All countries remain dangerously unprepared for future outbreaks,” the IFRC said, concluding that governments were no more ready now than in 2019.It said countries needed to be prepared for “multiple hazards, not just one”, saying societies only became truly resilient through planning for different types of disaster, as they can occur simultaneously.The IFRC cited the rise in climate-related disasters and waves of disease outbreaks this century, of which Covid-19 was just one.It said extreme weather events were growing more frequent and intense, “and our ability to merely respond to them is limited”.The IFRC issued two reports making recommendations on mitigating future tragedies on the scale of Covid-19, on the third anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring the virus an international public health emergency.“The Covid-19 pandemic should be a wake-up call for the global community to prepare now for the next health crisis,” said IFRC secretary general Jagan Chapagain.“The next pandemic could be just around the corner; if the experience of Covid-19 won’t quicken our steps toward preparedness, what will?”The report said major hazards harm those who are already vulnerable the most, and leaving the poorest exposed was “self-defeating”, as a disease can return in a more dangerous form. The IFRC said if people trusted safety messages, they would be willing to comply with public health measures and accept vaccination.But the organisation said crisis responders “cannot wait until the next time to build trust”, urging consistent cultivation over time.The IFRC said if trust was fragile, public health became political and individualised — something which impaired the Covid response.It also said the coronavirus pandemic had thrived on and exacerbated inequalities, with poor sanitation, overcrowding, lack of access to health and social services, and malnutrition creating conditions for diseases to thrive in.“The world must address inequitable health and socio-economic vulnerabilities far in advance of the next crisis,” it recommended.The organisation also said local communities should be leveraged to perform life-saving work, as that is where pandemics begin and end.The IFRC called for the development of pandemic response products that are cheaper, and easier to store and administer.By 2025, it said countries should increase domestic health finance by one percent of gross domestic product, and global health finance by at least $15 billion per year.The IFRC said its network had reached more than 1.1 billion people over the past three years to help keep them safe during the Covid pandemic.rjm/gil© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-says-covid-still-an-international-emergency/,WHO says Covid still an international emergency,1,", Three years to the day after the World Health Organization sounded the highest level of global alert over Covid-19, it said Monday the pandemic remains an international emergency.The UN health agency’s emergency committee on Covid-19 met last Friday for a 14th time since the start of the crisis.Following that meeting, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus “concurs with the advice offered by the committee regarding the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and determines that the event continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC),” the organisation said in a statement.Tedros, it said, “acknowledges the committee’s views that the Covid-19 pandemic is probably at a transition point and appreciates the advice of the committee to navigate this transition carefully and mitigate the potential negative consequences.”Even prior to the meeting, the WHO chief had suggested the emergency phase of the pandemic is not over, pointing to surging numbers of deaths and warning that the global response to the crisis “remains hobbled”.“As we enter the fourth year of the pandemic, we are certainly in a much better position now than we were a year ago, when the Omicron wave was at its peak, and more than 70,000 deaths were being reported to WHO each week,” he told the committee at the start of Friday’s meeting.Tedros said the weekly death rate had dropped below 10,000 in October but had been rising again since the start of December, while the lifting of Covid restrictions in China had led to a spike in deaths.In mid-January, almost 40,000 Covid weekly deaths were reported — more than half of them in China — while the true toll “is certainly much higher”, he said.The WHO first declared a so-called PHEIC as what was then called the novel coronavirus began to spread outside China on January 30, 2020.Though declaring a PHEIC is the internationally agreed mechanism for triggering a global response to such outbreaks, it was only after Tedros described the worsening Covid situation as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, that many countries realised the danger.Globally, more than 752 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been reported to the WHO, including more than 6.8 million deaths, though the United Nations’ health agency always stresses that the true numbers are likely much higher.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/nurses-in-england-launch-fresh-strikes-over-pay/,Nurses in England launch fresh strikes over pay,1,", (AFP) – It comes after nurses held an unprecedented strike last month, joining a wave of industrial action by public sector workers hit by the cost-of-living crisis.The main nursing union accuses the government of failing to negotiate seriously on improving their pay deal for the current year.The latest walkout piles further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS) at a time of peak demand and lengthy waiting lists for treatment.“It is inevitable industrial action will have an impact on patients,” health minister Steve Barclay said Tuesday.Two days of strikes by nurses in England and Wales in December led to the cancellation of “around 30,000 elective procedures and outpatient appointments”, Barclay said.“Patients will understandably be worried by the prospect of further strike action by nurses,” he added.Yet the plight of medical staff has prompted public sympathy as soaring food prices and energy bills have hit lower-paid workers across the board.A YouGov poll on Tuesday found 63 percent supported the nurses’ strike.But Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s official spokesman said Tuesday that it is not “the right course of action.“We continue to call unions to step away from the picket lines and continue with discussions.” Matthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation, which represents state health care providers in England and Wales, on Wednesday urged ministers to renew pay talks with trade unions.“Our message to the government is to give the NHS a fighting chance and do all you can to bring an end to this damaging dispute,” Taylor said.This week’s nursing strikes could cause 4,500 cancelled operations and 25,000 cancelled outpatient appointments, the NHS Confederation estimated.Further strikes are planned for February 6 and 7 by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) union, which said they will “be at the highest intensity in our history”.RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: “My olive branch to governments — asking them to meet me halfway and begin negotiations — is still there. They should grab it.”A union representing ambulance workers, GMB, is also expected to announce Wednesday that it will resume strike action.Ambulance drivers and paramedics this month held their second walkout in two months over pay and conditions.The GMB union tweeted Tuesday that “government silence on pay gives… no option but to strike”.Barclay said he was keen for dialogue to continue, citing “constructive talks” with unions.The NHS argues that it has given staff a “fair pay settlement”.Westminster MPs on Monday gave initial backing to controversial legislation that would require some frontline workers to maintain a minimum level of service during strikes.am/rox © Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/asthma-study-sparks-debate-about-safety-of-cooking-with-gas/,Asthma study sparks debate about safety of cooking with gas,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — New research that links cooking with natural gas to around 12 percent of childhood asthma cases has sparked debate about the health risks of kitchen stoves, as well as calls in the United States for stepped-up regulation.The authors of the study said their findings suggested that around 650,000 US children would not have developed asthma if their homes had electric or induction stovetops, comparing the impact on health to that of second-hand smoke.But an expert who was involved in the study questioned its findings and cautioned that gas remains far healthier than cooking with wood, charcoal and coal, which are estimated to cause 3.2 million deaths a year from household air pollution, overwhelmingly in developing countries.The peer-reviewed US study was published last month in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.It is based on a calculation of the risk of developing asthma in homes with a gas stove from a 2013 review of 41 previous studies.Combining that calculation with US census data, it linked 12.7 percent of US childhood asthma cases to gas cooking.The same calculation was previously used in 2018 research that attributed 12.3 percent of childhood asthma cases in Australia to gas stoves.A report released Monday used the same calculation to link 12 percent of childhood asthma to gas cooking in the European Union.The report, which has not been peer-reviewed, was released by the energy efficiency group CLASP and the European Public Health Alliance. The European report included computer simulations conducted by the Netherlands’ research organisation TNO analysing exposure to air pollution in different European household kitchens.The level of nitrogen dioxide was found to exceed EU and World Health Organization guidelines several times a week in all scenarios except for a large kitchen with a range hood that vented outside the home.Nitrogen dioxide, which is emitted when gas is burned, is “a pollutant closely linked to asthma and other respiratory conditions,” according to the WHO.This year, CLASP will collect air quality measurements from 280 kitchens across Europe in a bid to confirm the results.The research comes amid heightened scrutiny of gas stoves in the United States.Richard Trumka Jr, a commissioner at the Consumer Product Safety Commission, tweeted on Monday that the agency “will consider all approaches to regulation”.“To be clear, CPSC isn’t coming for anyone’s gas stoves. Regulations apply to new products,” he later added.The American Gas Association, a lobby group, denounced the US study as an “advocacy-based mathematical exercise that doesn’t add any new science”.Brady Seals, a manager at the Rocky Mountain Institute and co-author of the study, rebuffed the lobby group’s statement.“Of course it’s just math,” she told AFP. “But it gives us a number that we never had before.” Rob Jackson of Stanford University, who has previously published research showing that climate-warming methane can leak from gas stoves even when they are switched off, said the US paper was “supported by dozens of other studies concluding that breathing indoor pollution from gas can trigger asthma”.But researchers working to transition the three billion people still cooking with harmful solid fuels such as wood, coal and charcoal to cleaner sources expressed concern.Daniel Pope, a professor of global public health at the UK’s University of Liverpool, said that the link between asthma and pollution from gas stoves had yet to be definitively proven and that further research was needed.Pope is part of a team conducting research commissioned by the WHO to summarise the effects different kinds of fuel for cooking and heating can have on health.Pope told AFP that the results, which will be published later this year, indicate a “substantial reduction in risk” when people switched to gas from solid fuels and kerosene.They found “negligible effects (mostly non-significant) of using gas compared to electricity for all health outcomes — including asthma,” he added.Seals responded by saying that the study did not assume a causal relationship between asthma and gas cooking, but instead reported the association between exposure and the disease using studies dating back to the 1970s.“I think it’s a real problem that the international community is not explicitly recognising the very well known, very researched risk of gas stoves,” Seals said.“Gas is certainly better” than cooking with wood or coal, she said. “But it’s not clean.”© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/super-resistant-mosquitoes-in-asia-pose-growing-threat-study/,Super-resistant mosquitoes in Asia pose growing threat: study,1,", (Mosquitoes that transmit dengue and other viruses have evolved growing resistance to insecticides in parts of Asia, and novel ways to control them are desperately needed, new research warns.Health authorities commonly fog mosquito-infested areas with clouds of insecticide, and resistance has long been a concern, but the scale of the problem was not well understood.Japanese scientist Shinji Kasai and his team examined mosquitos from several countries in Asia as well as Ghana and found a series of mutations had made some virtually impervious to popular pyrethroid-based chemicals like permethrin.“In Cambodia, more than 90 percent of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have the combination of mutations that results in an extremely high level of resistance,” Kasai told AFP.He found some mosquito strains had 1,000-fold resistance, compared to the 100-fold seen previously.That meant insecticide levels that would normally kill almost 100 percent of mosquitoes in a sample killed only around seven percent of the insects.Even a dose 10 times stronger killed just 30 percent of the super-resistant mosquitoes.“The resistance level that we found in mosquitos in Cambodia and Vietnam is totally different,” said Kasai, director of the Department of Medical Entomology at Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases.Dengue can cause hemorrhagic fever and infects an estimated 100 to 400 million people a year, although over 80 percent of cases are mild or asymptomatic, according to the World Health Organization.Several dengue vaccines have been developed, and researchers have also used a bacteria that sterilizes mosquitoes to tackle the virus.But neither option is yet close to eradicating dengue, and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carry other diseases, including zika and yellow fever.Resistance was also detected in another type of mosquito, Aedes albopictus, though at lower levels — possibly because it tends to feed outdoors, often on animals, and may be exposed to insecticides less than its human-loving Aedes aegypti counterparts.The research found several genetic changes were linked with resistance, including two that occur close to the part of mosquitoes targeted by pyrethroid and several other insecticides.Resistance levels differed, with mosquitos from Ghana as well as parts of Indonesia and Taiwan still relatively susceptible to existing chemicals, particularly at higher doses.But the research shows “commonly employed strategies may no longer be effective,” said Cameron Webb, an associate professor and mosquito researcher at NSW Health Pathology and the University of Sydney.“There is growing evidence that there may not be a place for current insecticide formulations in controlling populations of key mosquito pests,” Webb told AFP.He said new chemicals are needed, but authorities and researchers also need to think of other ways to protect communities, including vaccines.“We have to think about rotating insecticides… that have different target sites,” added Kasai, whose research was published last month in the journal Science Advances.“The problem is that we don’t have so many different kinds that we can use.”Other options include more efforts to remove breeding sites.When and where the mutations for resistance emerged is still a mystery, but Kasai is now expanding the research elsewhere in Asia and examining more recent samples from Cambodia and Vietnam to see if anything has changed from the 2016-2019 study period.“We are worried that the mosquitoes with the mutations that we found in this study will spread to the rest of the world in the near future,” he said.“Before that, we have to think of a solution.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/beijing-slams-unacceptable-covid-rules-on-travellers-from-china/,Beijing slams ‘unacceptable’ Covid rules on travellers from China,1,", (China on Tuesday condemned fresh Covid test requirements by around a dozen countries on passengers travelling abroad from its territory, warning it could take “countermeasures” in response.The United States, Canada, France and Japan are among a number of countries that now require travelers from China to show a negative Covid test before arrival, as the country faces a surge in cases.“Some countries have taken entry restrictions targeting only Chinese travelers,” foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular briefing.“This lacks scientific basis and some practices are unacceptable,” she added, warning China could “take countermeasures based on the principle of reciprocity”.China is seeing a steep rise in infections after years of harsh zero-Covid restrictions were abruptly loosened last month with little warning or preparation, and hospitals and crematoriums have been quickly overwhelmed.In late December, Beijing said inbound travelers would no longer be required to quarantine, sending many Chinese people rushing to plan long-awaited trips abroad.Countries have cited China’s lack of transparency around infection data and the risk of new variants emerging as reasons to restrict travelers.China recorded only 22 Covid deaths since December, after dramatically narrowing the criteria for classifying such deaths.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/elderly-covid-patients-fill-hospital-wards-in-chinas-major-cities/,Elderly Covid patients fill hospital wards in China’s major cities,1,"CHONGQING, China (AFP) — Elderly patients lined the wards of hospitals in major cities in China Thursday as the country battled a wave of Covid cases.The virus is surging across the vast Asian nation in an outbreak authorities say is impossible to track after the end of mandatory mass testing.And with cases soaring, Washington called on Beijing to share its Covid outbreak data, saying China’s caseload impacts the world.Attached to a breathing tube under a pile of blankets, an old man racked with Covid-19 lay groaning on a stretcher in the emergency department of a hospital in central China.A paramedic at Chongqing Medical University First Affiliated Hospital, who confirmed the old man was a Covid patient, said he had picked up more than 10 people a day, 80 to 90 percent of whom were infected with coronavirus.“Most of them are elderly people,” he said.“A lot of hospital staff are positive as well, but we have no choice but to carry on working.”The old man waited half an hour to be treated, while in a nearby room AFP saw six other people in sick beds surrounded by harried doctors and relatives.They, too, were mostly elderly and, when asked if they were all Covid patients, a doctor said: “Basically.”Five were strapped to respirators and had obvious breathing difficulties.Millions of elderly people across China are still not fully vaccinated, raising concerns that the virus may kill the most vulnerable citizens in huge numbers.Under new government guidelines, however, many of those deaths would not be blamed on Covid.In Shanghai, the corridors of an emergency department were lined with stretchers filled with elderly people hooked up to oxygen tanks.An AFP reporter counted at least 15 such patients spilling out from wards into the hallway, some with suitcases next to their trolleys.Swaddled in colorful duvets, they wheezed weakly through their masks as medical workers attended to them. Many appeared mostly unresponsive. With Beijing scrambling to contain the outbreak, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday called on China to share information on its Covid crisis, as Washington renewed an offer to share American vaccines.“It is very important for all countries, including China, to focus on people getting vaccinated, making testing and treatment available and, importantly, sharing information with the world about what they’re experiencing — because it has implications not just for China, but for the entire world,” Blinken told a news conference.At a large crematorium on the rural outskirts of Chongqing, a long line of cars waited for parking spaces inside the compound Thursday.Dozens of bereaved relatives milled around in groups, some carrying wooden urns, as funeral gongs sounded and mourners burned incense.One middle-aged man carrying an urn told AFP an elderly relative died after testing positive for the virus.“It’s been constantly busy lately,” said one crematorium driver as he sat smoking in his car.“We work more than 10 hours a day with few breaks.”Another staffer wearing a face shield agreed.“It’s not possible to put bodies in cold storage, they must be cremated on the same day,” he said.Around 20 hearses lined the road to another crematorium in the city’s south on Thursday evening.Inside was a large car park, where bodies on stretchers were being unloaded onto a small raised platform before being transferred to upper levels.AFP saw about 40 bodies loaded onto the platform in two hours.Next to the raised level were two rooms of cold storage freezers. In one, AFP saw two covered bodies on stretchers and another partially uncovered body on the floor.Police and security guards patrolled the premises. A steady stream of cars carrying mourners arrived at a separate building where families were holding wakes.Some relatives watched through glass as their loved ones were cremated in adjacent rooms.A woman in her 20s told AFP she suspected her father had died of Covid, though he had not been tested.“He died too quickly, while on the way to hospital,” she sobbed. “He had lung issues to begin with…. He was only 69.”Another mourner said their relative had died of pneumonia, though they were not certain it was caused by Covid.“He wasn’t feeling well so we took him to the clinic the day before yesterday — the hospital wouldn’t take him in,” he said.One woman said her elderly relative, who was suffering from cold symptoms, had tested negative but died after they could not get an ambulance in time.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/uk-ambulance-workers-ready-to-join-widening-strikes/,UK ambulance workers ready to join widening strikes,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — UK ambulance workers readied to walk out on Wednesday, a day after nurses staged their second stoppage, in a widening dispute with the government which is refusing to cede to above-inflation demands on pay.The series of walkouts has intensified, with industrial action by railway workers and passport control officers threatening to ruin festive holiday getaways.On Wednesday, ambulance staff including paramedics and call handlers go on strike, prompting warnings from healthcare leaders.London’s biggest hospital group said “people giving birth will need to plan how they come into hospital”.“Where people are planning any risky activity, I would strongly encourage them not to do so,” said junior health minister Will Quince.“We never want to alarm people but we have reached the stage where our leaders feel it’s necessary to say they cannot guarantee patient safety,” said Matthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation which represents services including ambulance trusts in England and Wales.“We’re entering into a very dangerous time and this is why we’re upping even more our call to the government and to the trade unions to try to find a way of solving this dispute and helping us get through the winter,” he told the BBC.At least three ambulance services declared critical incidents due to “unprecedented” pressure, saying they would prioritize treatment for those most in need, such as life-threatening cases.Thousands of members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland took to picket lines on Tuesday, just five days after the first strike in its 106-year history.Unions representing both National Health Service (NHS) nurses and ambulance workers have threatened further stoppages in the new year if the government keeps refusing to discuss pay.Late Tuesday, the nurses’ representatives gave the government two days to agree to their salary demands to avert further strikes after festive holiday.“There are two days for us to meet and begin to turn this around,” said Pat Cullen, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing.“By Friday, we will be announcing the dates and hospitals for a strike next month.” Employees across the UK economy are demanding salary rises in the face of decades-high inflation — currently running at nearly 11 percent — which is spurring the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.But the government insists it must stick to more modest increases for public sector workers recommended by independent pay review bodies.“The best way to help them and help everyone else in the country is for us to get a grip and reduce inflation as quickly as possible,” Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told a watchdog panel of MPs.On the picket line outside a central London hospital opposite parliament, Mamta Pun, 25, said Sunak’s stance on the pay dispute was “a slap in the face for all healthcare staff, the general public and patients”.The intensive care nurse at the St Thomas’ Hospital, where former premier Boris Johnson was treated in intensive care for Covid-19, said she and her colleagues finished shifts “anxious, scared, terrified” because of their workload. The RCN has also criticized Sunak’s government for its pay stance and accused Health Secretary Steve Barclay of adopting a “macho” negotiating style during brief meetings held recently.It has warned that nurses would take wider industrial action next month if the government “keeps giving our nursing staff the cold shoulder as they have to date”.“It’s really unfortunate, that come January, we will see more hospitals being involved and striking and that means more nursing staff involved,” Cullen said.Ministers plan to draft in 750 military personnel to drive ambulances and perform logistics roles to mitigate the impact of those strikes.Despite the government’s dogged insistence that it will not negotiate over pay, polls indicate the majority of people support the nurses’ stance, and to a lesser extent other workers walking out.YouGov polling published Tuesday showed two-thirds of Britons support striking nurses, with similar support for ambulance staff (63 percent).However, people were more divided on other industries such as rail workers — whose walkouts 43 percent supported while 49 percent opposed — and postal workers, where the split was 49 percent versus 43 percent.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-eyes-end-to-covid-emergency-in-2023/,WHO eyes end to Covid emergency in 2023,1,", (The World Health Organization said Wednesday it hoped that Covid-19 would no longer be a public health emergency in 2023, as it urged China to share information that could pinpoint how the pandemic started.As the third anniversary of the original outbreak rolls around, the WHO said the virus was here to stay but would need managing alongside other respiratory illnesses.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the weekly Covid death toll was now around a fifth of what it was a year ago — but was still far too high.“Last week, less than 10,000 people lost their lives. That’s still 10,000 too many and there is still a lot that all countries can do to save lives,” he told a press conference.“But we have come a long way. We are hopeful that at some point next year, we will be able to say that Covid-19 is no longer a global health emergency.”The WHO’s emergency committee on Covid-19, which advises Tedros on whether the virus constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), will discuss the criteria for declaring an end to the emergency phase when they next meet in January.Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s Covid-19 technical lead, said the committee would look at the epidemiology, variants like Omicron, and the impact of the virus.While waves of infection are still expected, the pandemic “is not what it was in the beginning”, with cases resulting in fewer hospitalizations and deaths, she said.“These deaths are largely happening among people who are not vaccinated,” or have not received their full course of jabs, Van Kerkhove said.While the WHO says more than 13 billion vaccine doses have been administered, around 30 percent of the world has not received a single dose, she added.Nearly 650 million confirmed Covid cases and more than 6.6 million deaths have been reported to the WHO, though the UN health agency acknowledges this will be a vast undercount.Tedros said that as the world looks to end the Covid emergency, which has upended economies and left millions suffering ongoing symptoms, it needs to understand how the pandemic began.The first cases of Covid-19 were recorded in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.“We continue to call on China to share the data and conduct the studies that we have requested, to better understand the origins of this virus,” Tedros said.“All hypotheses remain on the table,” he said, adding that this includes the theory that the virus escaped from Wuhan’s virology laboratories.WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan said the organisation could not simply stop engaging with Beijing “because you’re not cooperating with us on the origins”, as a huge chunk of the world’s population live in China.Tedros said the virus had been around so long, it was almost part of the family.“This virus will not go away. It’s here to stay and all countries will need to learn to manage it alongside other respiratory illnesses,” he said.The WHO’s vaccines chief Kate O’Brien said that the current crop of Covid jabs do not prevent people from catching the virus to the level that had been hoped for.“We would love to have vaccines that are more effective against infection and transmission and have greater duration of protection,” O’Brien said, calling for more ongoing investment in research and development.On Mpox — formerly known as monkeypox — Tedros said the global outbreak this year had taken the world by surprise.But like Covid, the emergency phase should be over within 12 months, he said.More than 82,000 cases have been reported from 110 countries, although the mortality rate has remained low, with 65 deaths.“Thankfully, the number of weekly reported cases has declined more than 90 percent since I declared a PHEIC in July,” said Tedros.“If the current trend continues, we’re hopeful that next year we’ll also be able to declare an end to this emergency.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/striking-uk-nurses-say-walkouts-over-pay-last-resort/,Striking UK nurses say walkouts over pay ‘last resort’,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — UK nurses are set to walk out on strike for the first time in their union’s 106-year history this week, insisting they are taking action as a “last resort”.Up to 100,000 members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will hold a one-day stoppage on Thursday after rejecting a government pay offer.Chemotherapy, dialysis, intensive care and high-dependency units, as well as neonatal and paediatric intensive care will be protected.But other services will be reduced to Christmas staffing levels, the RCN said.Accident and emergency staff nurse Mark Boothroyd, 37, said the situation had reached a tipping point.“Workloads are horrendous. Nurses are burnt out, can’t provide safe service to patients. We are seeing harm to patients and patients put at risk every day,” he told AFP.Boothroyd, an RCN member and staff representative for the Unite union, said Thursday’s stoppage and another on December 20 were about restoring “quality of care for patients”.As in other countries, Britain is gripped by a cost-of-living crisis, pushing up prices for housing, food and energy.The RCN’s industrial action is part of a growing wave among public and private sector employees.Healthcare unions say their members are skipping meals, struggling to feed and clothe their families, and leaving the state-run National Health Service (NHS) in droves.But successive below-inflation awards since 2010 have left experienced nurses worse off by 20 percent in real terms, they say.The RCN wants a pay rise significantly above inflation which surged to a 41-year high of 11.1 percent in October. The government maintains that is unaffordable. Over the weekend, RCN general secretary Pat Cullen offered to “press pause” on the strikes if Health Secretary Steve Barclay agrees to talks.“I won’t dig in if he doesn’t dig in. Come to the table and let’s have the discussion,” she told BBC television on Sunday.But Barclay insisted that while he was open to talks on wider issues, the pay settlement was recommended by an independent review body and would not be reopened.“We are working hard to make sure patients experience as little disruption as possible” from the strikes, the health minister wrote in the Sun on Sunday newspaper.“But with the NHS already under pressure due to the Covid pandemic and coming winter, the risks to patients will be significant.”During the pandemic, Britons stood on their doorsteps every week to clap for nurses and doctors on the frontline of battling the virus.Now one in four hospitals say they have had to set up food banks to help staff eat.“Nurses are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis to pay bills… people are struggling to pay rents, pay transport, some of my colleagues are single mothers — they’re struggling to keep a roof over their heads and provide for their children,” said Boothroyd.Boothroyd, who works at St Thomas’ Hospital in central London, said poor pay meant newly qualified nurses now spend only a year or two before leaving the profession.The resulting unfilled vacancies have put huge pressure on remaining staff, many of whom were reporting mental health problems from stress.Conditions were “horrendous and cannot be allowed to go on”, he said.Despite assurances about the protection of “life-preserving services” and cancer care provision, Boothroyd conceded the strike would have an impact on patients.But he said it would be a “short-term disruption” to resolve the long-running problems plaguing the NHS, including lengthening appointment and treatment backlogs.“We feel we’ve been forced into this… As a union rep, we’ve protested, we’ve demonstrated, we’ve written to the government,” he said.“We’ve done everything possible to tell them how bad this has been getting and they’ve not listened to us, so the strike is the last resort.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/indonesia-families-sue-government-over-cough-syrup-deaths-injuries/,Indonesia families sue government over cough syrup deaths,1,", (A dozen Indonesian families whose relatives died or were injured after consuming tainted cough syrups have sued the government and companies accused of supplying the products, according to a lawsuit.The Southeast Asian country has seen a spike in cases of acute kidney injury since August, with the deaths of at least 199 people, mostly children, prompting a probe and ban on some liquid medicine sales.The class action lawsuit targets the ministry of health, the country’s food and drug agency and seven companies implicated in selling syrups containing excessive amounts of two compounds used in industrial products such as antifreeze.Awan Puryadi, a legal representative of the victims’ relatives, told AFP they took action because the authorities failed to prevent the sale of harmful medicines and the subsequent child deaths or injuries.“No one has claimed responsibility. They are very disappointed with the current situation,” Puryadi said Thursday about the lawsuit, which was filed on November 18.“We demand the… drug suppliers, pharmacies, the BPOM (food and drug agency) and the health ministry all take responsibility.”Families are seeking compensation of around 2 billion rupiah ($127,049) for every person killed and around 1 billion rupiah ($63,524) for every person injured, the lawyer said.Two families listed on the lawsuit were pursuing legal action on behalf of a total of 12 families, he said, adding more could join in the future.Police have launched an investigation into at least three companies that had their licenses to produce syrup medicines temporarily frozen.In West Africa, The Gambia recorded 70 child deaths in October suspected to have been caused by imported syrup medicines.The World Health Organization has said it found an “unacceptable amount” of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol in four Indian-made cough syrups and warned they could be linked to the deaths.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/alzheimers-drug-data-shows-results-but-also-risks/,injuries,1,", (Experts hailed full data Wednesday showing a new drug can slow cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s patients, but warned improvements were comparatively small and the treatment can have serious side effects.Preliminary data from a trial of lecanemab was released in September and found it slowed cognitive decline by 27 percent across an 18-month period.The complete trial data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, fleshes out those findings but also raises concern about the incidence of “adverse effects” including brain bleeds and swelling.The results showed 17.3 percent of patients administered the drug experienced brain bleeds, compared with nine percent of those receiving a placebo.And 12.6 percent of those taking the drug experienced brain swelling, compared with just 1.7 percent of those in the placebo group.Deaths were reported at approximately the same rate in both arms of the trial of the drug, which was developed by firms Biogen and Eisai.The results were broadly welcomed by researchers and campaigners for patients with the disease, including Bart De Strooper, director of the UK Dementia Research Institute.“This is the first drug that provides a real treatment option for people with Alzheimer’s,” he said.“While the clinical benefits appear somewhat limited, it can be expected that they will become more apparent if the drug is administered over a longer time period.”In Alzheimer’s disease, two key proteins, tau and amyloid beta, build up into tangles and plaques, known together as aggregates, which cause brain cells to die and lead to brain shrinkage.Lecanemab works by targeting amyloid, and De Strooper said the drug proved effective at clearing it but also had “beneficial effects on other hallmarks of Alzheimer’s, including tau”.The phase 3 trial involved nearly 1,800 people, divided between those given the drug and given a placebo, and ran over 18 months.They were assessed on a clinical scale for Alzheimer’s patients that measures cognition and function, as well as for changes in amyloid levels and other indicators.But Tara Spires-Jones, programme lead at the UK Dementia Research Institute, noted that “there is not an accepted definition of clinically meaningful effects in the cognitive test they used”.“It is not clear yet whether the modest reduction in decline will make a big difference to people living with dementia. Longer trials will be needed to be sure that the benefits of this treatment outweigh the risks,” she added.The drug also only targets those in the early stages of the disease with a certain level of amyloid build-up, limiting the number of people who could potentially use the treatment.And as Alzheimer’s is not always caught quickly, some experts said an overhaul in early diagnosis would be needed to ensure more people could benefit.“This isn’t the end of the journey for lecanemab –- it’s being explored in further trials to see how well it works over a longer period of time,” said Richard Oakley, associate director of research at the Alzheimer’s Society.“The safety of drugs is crucial and lecanemab did have side effects, but they will be closely looked at when decisions are made about whether or not to approve lecanemab, to see if the benefits outweigh the risks,” he said.Biogen and Eisai previously brought the Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm to market, but there was significant controversy over the evidence that it worked, and its approval led to three high-level resignations in the US Food and Drug Administration.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/record-number-of-children-miss-measles-vaccine-global-report/,Alzheimer’s drug data shows results but also risks,1,", (AFP)A record high of nearly 40 million children around the world missed a measles vaccine dose in 2021, according to a new report Wednesday that found immunization levels had failed to rebound from disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.The research, which was jointly published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the decline was a major setback in eliminating the deadly disease.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted the irony in the fact that while vaccines against Covid were developed and deployed in record time, routine immunization programs were badly impacted, leaving millions at risk.“Getting immunization programs back on track is absolutely critical. Behind every statistic in this report is a child at risk of a preventable disease,” he said in a statement.According to the report, 25 million children missed their first dose while 14.7 million missed their second.Measles is almost entirely preventable through vaccination.But because it is so contagious, an estimated 95 percent of a population needs to be vaccinated with two or more doses in order to create herd immunity to achieve and maintain elimination.In 2021, only 81 percent of children globally received their first dose and 71 percent received their second.It was the lowest global coverage rate of the first dose since 2008.The five countries with the highest number of infants who did not receive their first dose were Nigeria, India, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Indonesia.No WHO region has achieved and sustained measles elimination, and the virus can quickly spread across borders.Since 2016, ten countries that had previously eliminated measles experienced outbreaks and reestablished transmission.Measles is characterized by high fever and a telltale rash — though part of what makes it so dangerous is that it can be contagious for days before the rash emerges.Complications can include pneumonia and swelling of the brain, which can cause permanent disability.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/ebola-trial-vaccines-heading-to-uganda-who/,Bacterial infections the ‘second leading cause of death worldwide’,1,", (Three candidate vaccines against the strain of Ebola wreaking havoc in Uganda will be shipped to the East African country next week for trials, the World Health Organization said Wednesday.Since Uganda declared an Ebola outbreak on September 20, cases have spread across the country, including to the capital Kampala, and have claimed 55 lives, with 22 more believed to have died.Uganda has been struggling to rein in the outbreak caused by the Sudan strain of the virus, for which there is currently no vaccine.But UN health agency chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters that vaccine trials would soon begin.Speaking from the G20 summit in Indonesia, he said a WHO committee of external experts had evaluated candidate vaccines and determined “all three should be included in the planned trial in Uganda”.The WHO and the Ugandan health ministry accepted the committee’s recommendation, he said, adding: “We expect the first doses of vaccine to be shipped to Uganda next week.”The WHO hailed the “incredibly fast collaboration” to reach this point.“Since the outbreak began, the government of Uganda, together with researchers, funders, companies, regulatory authorities and other experts has been working under a global effort coordinated by WHO to accelerate the development and deployment of vaccines for use in trials,” Tedros pointed out.The candidates include a vaccine developed by Oxford University and the Jenner Institute in Britain, and another from the Sabin Vaccine Institute in the United States.The third candidate came through the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), WHO said.They will be used in a so-called ring vaccination trial, where all contacts of confirmed Ebola patients, and contacts of contacts are jabbed along with frontline and health workers.“We have received written confirmation from the developers that sufficient vaccines and sufficient number of doses will be available for the clinical trial, and beyond if necessary,” Ana Maria Henao Restrepo, one of WHO’s heads of research and development, told reporters.There is meanwhile concern that progress being made to slow the spread of Ebola even without the jabs could complicate the planned trials.Such trials can only be run when there is fairly rapid transmission under way of Ebola, a hemorrhagic fever that spreads through close contact with bodily fluids and that is often deadly.“We have uncertainty… about the evolution of the outbreak,” Henao Restrepo said, acknowledging that it remained unclear “how many rings can be formed as part of the trial.”But she stressed that all those involved were committed to pushing ahead with randomized trials in a bid to “generate robust evidence that will allow us to know if one or more of them has the efficacy we hope they have.”WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan insisted it was important to get started, even if lower transmission levels might make it impossible to complete the trials immediately.“If we have to do this in one or two steps, we will,” he told reporters.At the same time, Ryan emphasized that “this epidemic is controllable without vaccines.”Experience from the far more frequent outbreaks of the Ebola Zaire strain — for which a vaccine was developed after the massive West Africa outbreak that started in 2013 — shows that “you can get control much quicker using effective vaccines,” he told reporters.“But just to reassure people in Uganda, we can stop this outbreak based on the current efforts.”Tedros agreed, insisting that Kampala’s efforts had already “slowed transmission in most districts.”He pointed out that two districts had not reported any cases for 42 days, “indicating the virus is no longer present in those districts”.But he warned that Jinja had also reported its first case in the past week, “becoming the ninth district to be affected”.In addition to the candidate vaccines, the WHO said a separate group of experts had selected two investigational therapeutics for a trial, which still requires a green light from WHO and Ugandan authorities.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/billion-youth-risk-hearing-loss-from-headphones-venues-study/,Ebola trial vaccines heading to Uganda: WHO,1,", (Around one billion young people worldwide could be at risk of hearing loss from listening to headphones or attending loud music venues, a large review of the available research estimated on Wednesday.The World Health Organization-led study called on young people to be more careful about their listening habits, and urged governments and manufacturers to do more to protect future hearing.The analysis published in the journal BMJ Global Health looked at data from 33 studies published in English, Spanish, French and Russian over the last two decades covering more than 19,000 participants aged between 12-34.It found that 24 percent of the young people had unsafe listening practices while using headphones with devices such as smartphones.And 48 percent were found to have been exposed to unsafe noise levels at entertainment venues such as concerts or nightclubs.Combining these findings, the study estimated that between 670,000 to 1.35 billion young people could be at risk of hearing loss.The wide range is partly because some young people are probably at risk from both factors, said Lauren Dillard, an audiologist at the Medical University of South Carolina and the study’s first author.Dillard told AFP the best way for people to lessen their risk of hearing loss from headphones is to turn down the volume and listen for shorter periods.“Unfortunately, people do really like very loud music,” she admitted.Headphone users should use settings. or apps on smartphones to monitor sound levels, Dillard advised.In loud environments, noise-cancelling headphones can help avoid “cranking up your music to try to drown out all that background noise”, she added.Earplugs should be worn at loud events like concerts or nightclubs, she said, adding, “Maybe it’s fun to be in the front by the speakers, but it’s not a good idea for your long-term health.“All of these behaviors, these exposures can compound over the course of your entire life, and then when you’re 67 years old, it can have a pretty big impact,” she said.Dillard called on governments to comply with WHO guidelines on safe listening, including making sure venues monitor and limit music levels.She also urged companies that make devices like phones to warn listeners when the volume is too loud, and to include parental locks to restrict children’s exposure.Limitations of the research included the varying methodologies across different studies and that none came from low-income countries.Stephen Stansfeld, an expert on noise and health at Queen Mary University of London who was not involved in the research, said it showed “the potential for serious population-wide hearing loss is very large”.More than 430 million people — over five percent of the world’s population — currently have disabling hearing loss, according to the WHO, which estimates the number will rise to 700 million by 2050.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/trump-acolyte-kari-lake-loses-arizona-governor-race/,Billion youth risk hearing loss from headphones,1,", by Huw GRIFFITHDonald Trump loyalist and prominent election denier Kari Lake has lost her bid to be governor of Arizona, US networks projected Monday, rounding out a difficult week for the former president as he readies a new run for the White House.Lake, a former TV anchor, had been seen as one of Trump’s most reliable picks heading into the midterm elections, but her defeat caps a run of results that have raised doubts about the former president’s place in the Republican Party.The projections by major US TV networks come after a week of intense scrutiny of the vote count in Arizona, where Lake and her supporters have repeatedly cast doubt on the competence and integrity of officials.“Democracy is worth the wait,” tweeted Lake’s opponent, Democrat Katie Hobbs.“Thank you, Arizona. I am so honored and so proud to be your next Governor.”Democracy is worth the wait. Thank you, Arizona. I am so honored and so proud to be your next Governor. — Katie Hobbs (@katiehobbs) But Lake, who has built her brand on skepticism of the mainstream media and the political establishment appeared to reject the projections.“Arizonans know BS when they see it,” she tweeted, using a euphemism for nonsense. If confirmed by election officials, Hobbs’s victory would mark an end to a bitter election campaign which Lake joined in earnest when she quit local broadcast journalism last year.The former anchor married her made-for-tv smile to the flame-throwing political style of Trumpism, delighting the Make America Great Again wing of her party.She made denial of the 2020 presidential election win by Joe Biden a key tenet of her campaign, and said that she would not have validated his victory if she had been in the governor’s mansion at the time.Her caustic attacks on journalists and election officials, including the Republicans heading key departments in hotly contested Maricopa County, earned her plaudits with the base.But they also led to warnings that she was stoking trouble in a country still reeling from the January 2021 assault on the Capitol by Trump supporters.Democratic National Convention chair Jaime Harrison on Monday tweeted his congratulations to Hobbs along with the phrase: “Sanity wins!”Hobbs thanked the voters after her projected win.“For the Arizonans who did not vote for me, I will work just as hard for you — because even in this moment of division, I believe there is so much more that connects us,” she said in a statement quoted by US media.Trump, who is expected on Tuesday to announce his entry to the 2024 race for the White House, took to his Truth Social platform to denounce the call.“Wow! They just took the election away from Kari Lake. It’s really bad out there!” he wrote, without explaining who “they” were.Lake had declared herself “100 percent confident” that she would prevail, but — in line with Trump’s playbook — had expended a lot of energy sowing doubt about the election system.Supporters seized upon minor problems with vote tabulation machines in Maricopa County, the home of America’s fifth biggest city, Phoenix, which left some people standing in short lines last Tuesday.Officials have forcefully insisted that no legitimate vote would be excluded, and mounted a well-organized social media campaign to push back at falsehoods circulating online as the count plodded methodically on.Arizona has been under intense scrutiny for two years since Biden eked out a narrow win in the state.Maricopa County became ground zero for election deniers, who made unfounded claims about ballot stuffing, despite repeated investigations that turned up no evidence of wrongdoing.The slow-moving count in Arizona has been the subject of national — and international — fascination this week as it became increasingly clear that election deniers across the United States had fared badly.Lake was thought of as a leading light in the movement, and Republican Party insiders — as well as media pundits — have noted that regardless of the result, she could be well placed for a spot on a future White House ticket.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/threat-multiplier-how-climate-change-affects-health/,venues: study,1,"Paris, France (AFP) — Deadlier than Covid, or even rivalling cancer? Researchers have been increasingly attempting to calculate the effect climate change will have on health if the world does not act quickly to reduce carbon emissions.The World Health Organization, which says climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity, has called for the issue to be “front and centre” in negotiations at the COP27 summit being held in Egypt.But quantifying the overall impact is an extremely complicated task, experts told AFP, because global warming affects health in many different ways, from the immediate dangers of rising heat and extreme weather to longer-term food and water shortages, air pollution and disease.The WHO estimates that climate change will cause 250,000 extra deaths a year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress between 2030 and 2050.That is widely thought to be a “massively conservative estimate” of the true toll, partly because it only comes from four sources, said Jess Beagley, policy lead at the NGO Global Climate and Health Alliance.“Climate change is a threat multiplier,” she told AFP.“As climate change worsens, we’re going to see the biggest threats to human health increase.”Nearly 70 percent of all deaths worldwide are from diseases that could be made worse by global warming, according to a report this year from the IPCC, the United Nations’ panel of climate experts. Another major health threat comes from food shortages. Nearly 100 million additional people faced severe food insecurity in 2020 compared to 1981-2010, according to a report last month from The Lancet Countdown, a leading effort to quantify climate change’s impact on health.Extreme drought has increased by nearly a third over the last 50 years, it added, putting hundreds of millions at risk of lacking access to fresh water.And air pollution contributed to 3.3 million deaths in 2020, 1.2 million of which were directly related to fossil fuel emissions, the report found.Researchers have also been sounding the alarm that warmer temperatures are pushing virus-carrying animals like mosquitoes into new areas, increasing the spread of existing diseases — and raising the risk of new ones jumping across to humans. The likelihood of dengue transmission rose by 12 percent over the last 50 years, while warming temperatures extended malaria season in parts of Africa by 14 percent, the Lancet Countdown report said.Projecting into the future, a new platform launched last week by the United Nations Development Programme and the Climate Impact Lab warned that global warming could become deadlier than cancer in some parts of the world.Under the modelling research’s worst-case scenario in which fossil fuel emissions are not rapidly scaled back, climate change could cause death rates to increase by 53 deaths per 100,000 people worldwide by 2100 — around double the current rate for lung cancer.For the current global population, that would mean 4.2 million additional deaths a year, more than the official toll from Covid-19 in 2021. Climate Impact Lab’s Hannah Hess told AFP that the projections were probably conservative because they compared previous data on mortality and weather with possible future temperatures, so did not include potential threats such as vector-borne diseases.The platform also gave specific local projections for more than 24,000 regions worldwide. Under the worst-case scenario, it found that in Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, climate change-related deaths could double those from all cancers by 2100. The study did project that death rates would fall in some northern, mostly wealthy nations, where fewer cold spells could lead to a net improvement in health.This “speaks even more to the potential of climate change to exacerbate inequality”, she added.There have been calls to include such additional deaths into the “social cost of carbon”, the price put on the harm attributable to a tonne of CO2.Research published in September estimated that the current price of $51 per metric tonne was nearly four times too low, in part because it underestimated the effect of extra deaths.The global charity Wellcome Trust is among those funding further research on global warming’s impact on health, according to its climate and health director Alan Dangour.Dangour told AFP that soon “climate change will influence every aspect of public health”.“If we don’t embed climate change into our thinking, we’ve completely missed the point.”"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/for-struggling-haiti-return-of-cholera-is-a-catastrophe/,For struggling Haiti,1,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AFP) — When humanitarian officials in Haiti try to describe their concerns over a new, fast-spreading cholera epidemic, they struggle to find words strong enough: “alarming,” “chaotic,” even “a catastrophe.”A sizable part of the island’s population has been isolated — and unable to access health care — either by serious fuel shortages or by the brutal armed gangs that control vast areas.And without health care, cholera patients, who suffer acute diarrhea, can die of dehydration in just hours.“It’s a catastrophe. We’re overwhelmed,” Doctor Jean William Pape told AFP. His NGO, called Gheskio, operates two of the country’s 15 cholera treatment centers.In one of them, in the capital of Port-au-Prince, “we have 80 beds, and they’re all occupied,” he said. “Due to the fuel shortage, people in the slums have told me there have been several deaths in their areas, because it wasn’t possible to transport the sick people.”An armed gang has for weeks been blockading a key fuel terminal at Varreux, north of the capital, aggravating the country’s paralysis.UN peacekeepers introduced cholera to Haiti in 2010, ultimately resulting in thousands of deaths.But, until the latest outbreak, no case of the disease had been reported in Haiti since 2019.As of Wednesday, 33 cholera deaths and 960 suspected cases have been logged by the health ministry.And that number could seriously understate the problem, according to Bruno Maes, the UNICEF representative in Haiti.The situation is all the more frustrating, experts say, given that even serious cholera cases are easily treatable with a few days of rest and rehydration, and that there is a cholera vaccine.That vaccine, however, is only effective for around five years, and the last big targeted vaccination campaign in Haiti was in 2017. Roughly half of all cases here have involved children younger than 14, who are particularly vulnerable when their immune systems are weakened by poor nutrition due to poverty.“Many of them are very badly nourished,” said Pape, the doctor, adding it was difficult to find their veins to administer solutions intravenously.The UN estimates that 4.7 million Haitians, nearly half the country’s population, suffer from acute food insecurity.Doctors Without Borders (MSF) operates four centers with a total of 250 beds and some 20 oral-rehydration clinics, deputy mission chief Moha Zemrag told AFP.He said a priority is securing access to potable water in gang-controlled areas like the Brooklyn neighborhood in the capital’s Cite Soleil commune, which has had no fresh water for three months.Cholera is caused by the ingestion of water or food contaminated with a bacteria called vibrio cholerae.The high risk of kidnapping by the gangs has prevented aid groups from entering these areas to disinfect homes and buildings with chlorine.While MSF has established a system of shuttles to safely bring its personnel to treatment centers, fuel shortages could make this impossible “in a few weeks,” Zemrag said.Concern is also growing for rural dwellers, who, without access to fuel, may have to walk days for help. Early cases have been detected in the southern region of Nippes and in Artibonite to the north.Armed groups now blockade highways leading both to the north and south, Maes said.“Port-au-Prince is literally surrounded, strangled,” he said.UNICEF’s offices have been pillaged, and shipments of medication have been blocked at the port. The return of cholera has revived nightmarish memories of the epidemic introduced by blue-helmeted UN peacekeepers in 2010, after a major earthquake ravaged the country. The disease claimed more than 10,000 lives from then until 2019.But conditions today are different, said Sylvain Aldighieri, deputy director of public health emergencies with the Pan American Health Organization.“For now, we’re not seeing an explosion (in cases) as we observed during the first months” of 2010, he said.He said the authorities have “10 years’ experience with cholera” and the key now is to “reactivate the mechanisms” that worked before.Doing so, however, presents challenges.The UN on Friday imposed sanctions, including an arms embargo, on several gangs. But it remains divided on whether to send a new international force to the country.Such a force, said Aldighieri, might be able to establish “humanitarian corridors for difficult zones,” and help free supplies now blocked in ports.At the moment, he added, airplanes carrying additional supplies are expected in the coming days.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/close-the-windows-lebanon-power-plant-sparks-cancer-fears/,return of cholera is a ‘catastrophe’,1,", by Jonathan SAWAYAAfter losing four relatives to respiratory illness, Zeina Matar fled her hometown north of Lebanon’s capital where she says a decaying power plant generates little electricity but very deadly pollution.Thick black smoke sometimes billows from its red-and-white chimneys, leaving a grey haze in the air above the Zouk Mikael industrial district where the toxins remain trapped by a nearby mountain chain.Zeina, aged 40, says she lost her younger sister and a cousin to pulmonary fibrosis and that two of her uncles died of lung cancer years earlier.They all lived near the plant where, experts and residents believe, air pollution means people are more likely to develop cancer and respiratory disease than anywhere else in the crisis-torn country.“We could die tomorrow,” said Zeina, who has relocated to Lebanon’s south to escape the plant’s emissions.A Greenpeace study found that the surrounding Jounieh area ranked fifth in the Arab world and 23rd globally for cities most contaminated by nitrogen dioxide, a dangerous pollutant released when fuel is burnt.The environmental group’s 2018 study singled out the Zouk plant, built in the 1940s, as well as cars on a busy motorway and privately owned electricity generators as the main causes of pollution.The walls of Zeina’s balconies in her old Zouk Mikael home are blackened by the smoke, and laundry she used to hang outside would be damaged by toxic chemicals emanating from the plant, she said.“Whenever they refill the station with fuel oil, we would close the windows,” Zeina said. “The smell is unbearable.”Lebanon’s economy has been in free-fall since a financial crisis hit late in 2019, with authorities now barely able to afford more than an hour of mains electricity a day.The Zouk Mikael plant, one of the country’s largest, now runs at minimum capacity when it operates at all, but still its emissions are causing high rates of pulmonary disease, experts warn.Among them is Paul Makhlouf, a lung doctor at the Notre Dame du Liban Hospital in Jounieh, who said he abandoned his local apartment after noticing a rise in respiratory disease among patients.In 2014, he found that lung ailments had increased by three percent in patients living near the plant compared to the previous year, an annual rise he estimates has now doubled.“When I saw the results, I moved from there,” he said. “I fled.”Makhlouf mainly blames the type of fuel burnt at the Zouk Mikael plant, which he says is rich in sulphide and nitric oxide — carcinogenic chemicals that affect the respiratory system and the skin.Compounding the problem, he said, is the fact the seaside plant is located at a low altitude, with heavy smoke trapped in the densely-populated area by nearby mountains that overlook the Mediterranean.Pictures went viral online last month of thick black smoke again billowing from the Zouk plant as it burnt low-quality fuel oil to produce just one hour of power that day.The energy ministry said the plant had been forced to use heavy fuel to “keep supplying the airport, hospitals and other vital institutions” with electricity.Since then, the plant has mostly operated at night.“Sometimes, we wake up to a loud noise in the middle of the night” when the station kicks into action and burns fuel oil, said Zeina’s 80-year-old aunt Samia, who still lives near the plant.Elie Beaino, who heads the Zouk municipality, said a second plant, built without authorisation in 2014, runs somewhat more cleanly on higher-quality fuel or gas, but that it has stopped working as its operators cannot afford those higher-quality hydrocarbons.“Most residents want the power plants to close down,” he said.Lawmaker Najat Saliba, an atmospheric chemist, said residents near Zouk are at least seven times more likely to develop cancer than those of Beirut, citing a 2018 study she helped author for the American University of Beirut.She said the heavy fuel oil it uses releases harmful chemicals. “The solution is to import quality fuel oil and gas,” she said, adding however that Lebanon cannot afford those fuels.“We have two options today,” she said. “To switch the lights off at the airport and in hospitals, or to sit under a black cloud in Zouk.”© Agence France-Presse"

The rise in cases of AKI began in January this year, and accelerated further since late August, the ministry spokesperson said, adding that a probe was launched last week.“Since late August 2022, the ministry and the paediatrician association have received increasing reports of acute kidney injury. The jump is sharp,” the spokesperson said.Most of the cases reported in Indonesia involved children aged under 18, mainly toddlers under five years old, the ministry said. Before the recent rise, the ministry typically saw one or two cases of AKI a month"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/life-expectancies-diverged-in-pandemics-second-year-study/,Indonesia bans all syrup,1,"Paris, France (AFP)– There was a dramatic divergence in the average life expectancy of people in different global regions during the second year of the pandemic, a study found Monday, as higher vaccination rates helped some nations recover far more quickly than others.Because governments have counted Covid statistics in different ways, researchers have sought to give a clearer picture of the pandemic’s true impact by measuring a country’s total number of annual deaths from all causes and comparing it to the number from before the pandemic.Last year, researchers at Oxford University’s Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science said that in 2020 the pandemic caused the biggest decrease in life expectancy since World War II.But in 2021, a “sudden divergence appears,” said Ridhi Kashyap, a professor of demography at Oxford and co-author of the latest study, published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.“Some countries start showing signs of a recovery,” while others have “worsening, compounding losses,” he told AFP.The researchers analysed mortality data across 29 European countries, the United States and Chile since 2015.Many countries in Western Europe saw their life expectancy bounce back to near pre-pandemic levels. France, Belgium, Switzerland and Sweden even managed to fully return to 2019’s number.However in Eastern Europe, life expectancy dropped to a level not seen since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the study said.In Bulgaria, life expectancy fell by 25 months in 2021 after dropping 18 months the year before, meaning it plunged more than three and a half years since the start of the pandemic. Bulgaria has the lowest vaccination rate in the European Union. Countries that had a higher percentage of their population fully vaccinated by October 2021 had a smaller drop in life expectancy, the study found.“This suggests that clearly there is a link,” Kashyap said.The age of people dying from Covid also shifted younger, with the life expectancy of over-80s returning to normal in many places.This was “partly a sign of vaccines really protecting the old,” Kashyap said.In the US, deaths of people aged over 80 bounced back to pre-pandemic levels, but fatalities soared for the middle-aged and younger, resulting in the country’s life expectancy falling by nearly three months.Jonas Schoeley, a study co-author from Germany’s Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, said countries such as “Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium and France, managed a recovery to pre-pandemic levels of life expectancy because they managed to protect both the old and the young.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/spanish-baby-gets-groundbreaking-intestinal-transplant/,liquid medicines after children’s deaths,1,", A 13-month old baby girl received the world’s first intestinal transplant, Spanish health authorities have announced.The baby “has already been discharged and is in perfect condition at home with her parents”, said the statement from Madrid’s La Paz hospital, issued Tuesday.The baby received the organ via asystolic donation — from a donor at the end of their life.This method of donation means “the organ to be transplanted does not deteriorate”, said the statement.The technique had not previously been used for the intestine because it was not thought to be possible for this organ “despite the fact that 30 percent of the candidates die on the waiting list”, said the hospital.“The intestine is a lymphoid organ closely linked to the person’s immune system which, under normal conditions, is colonised by multiple germs,” the statement added.This means that the risk of “rejection and the possibility of infection” is higher than in other transplants.Three years of research and trials by several teams at the hospital were required to establish that such an operation was feasible, it added.Spain is a world leader in organ transplants, according to figures from the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation.It also accounted for five percent of organ donations in the world in 2021, when it has only 0.6 percent of the world’s population.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/what-have-they-done-flip-side-of-turkeys-dental-boom/,Life expectancies diverged in pandemic’s second year: study,1,"Istanbul, Turkey (AFP) — Briton Rida Azeem knew her dental trip to Turkey had gone badly wrong the second she took off her mask.“My husband said, ‘What have they done to you? Your face is all sunk.'”“I had big gaps underneath my gums and you could see all the metal bits (of the implants). It was done so badly it was unbelievable,” the engineer from Manchester told AFP.“Originally they were going to do five implants,” said Azeem. But when the treatment was about to start, the dentists told her they would “have to remove all your teeth”.“They looked professional,” said the 42-year-old, who now has to wear false teeth.Attracted by the promise of the perfect smile at an unbeatable price, 150,000 to 250,000 foreign patients flock to Turkey every year, according to the Turkish Dentists’ Association (TDB), making it one of the world’s main dental tourism destinations alongside Hungary, Thailand and Dubai.But the “Hollywood smile” sold by clinics in Istanbul, Izmir or Antalya often involves trimming — or even extracting — healthy teeth, sometimes taking all of them out.“Many dental clinics in Turkey treat teeth that don’t need treatment,” the head of an Istanbul clinic, who did not want to be named, told AFP.“They put veneers on teeth that only need bleaching or lightening, sometimes they even put full crowns.” Azeem is far from the only foreign patient to have been left disfigured or in chronic pain.Alana Boone, a 23-year-old Belgian woman who travelled to Antalya in July 2021, was one of the five foreigners AFP talked to who suffered serious complications.The 28 crowns she had done seemed fine, but only on the surface. They were “placed too deep. Now I have inflammation and pain every day… at times it is very intense,” she said.“The only solution would be to remove everything but dentists do not know what they are going to find.”Marie, a French nurse, felt she needed work on her lower teeth to boost her confidence after going through a separation. “I wanted to look more attractive,” she said.But a Turkish dentist persuaded her to put crowns on her top ones too — 28 in total.“I had very healthy teeth. I began to regret it all when they began to file my teeth,” she said.“After about a month, the problems started: teeth began to move, and food began to get stuck between them… My breath is so awful that even mouthwash” doesn’t help, said the fortysomething. The British Dental Association has sounded the alarm about the phenomenon, warning of the “considerable risks… of cut-price treatment” abroad, warning of many cases of infections and “ill-fitting crowns and implants that fell out”.Patrick Solera, of the French dentists’ union, said he was horrified to see influencers going to Turkey “to have their teeth trimmed”.“You do not put a crown on a tooth that’s a little yellow, and trimming a healthy tooth to put a crown amounts to mutilation. In France they lock you up for that.”But Tarik Ismen, of the TBD, insisted that Turkish dentists were only responding to a need. “Some people want to look like Hollywood stars and have a bright, fluorescent smile. If Turkish dentists are not going to do it for them, there are Albanian or Polish ones who will do it,” he told AFP. He said that botched surgery rates of “three to five percent is acceptable… and could happen anywhere”, adding that not one of his association’s 40,000 dentists had been struck off.“Turkish dentists are the best and the cheapest in the world,” declared Turker Sandalli, who pioneered dental tourism in Turkey 20 years ago.He boasted that “not one tooth has been extracted in 12 years” in his Istanbul clinic, where 99 percent of the clientele are foreigners. “But — and I am sad to tell you this — 90 percent of Turkish clinics go for cheap dentistry,” he said, accusing “2,000 to 3,000” illegal operators of blackening the industry. Berna Aytac, head of the Istanbul Chamber of Dentists, accused medical tourism agencies of “dragging down the quality of care”.Almost all foreign clients that AFP talked to travelled to Turkey with all-inclusive deals booked through agencies that took in their transport, treatment and accommodation. More than 450 medical tourism agencies are licensed by the Turkish health ministry, but AFP discovered that some use misleading material to attract customers.Among them is Sule Dental which presents itself as having its own “dental clinic” even though it is officially only an intermediary.Sule Dental uses photos and glowing endorsements from former clients with beaming smiles on its internet homepage. One woman calls the staff “AWESOME!!!!”, while another praises its “very caring” doctors.But the pictures are stock photos taken from an image bank. AFP found the same photos being used to publicise a clinic in Antalya called Perla Dental as well as a Tunisian medical agency.On Instagram, where Sule Dental has 390,000 followers, glowing videos from former patients include two from Britons who told AFP that they had suffered complications. One was left with “root canal damage. I started to bleed a lot when I was brushing my teeth,” he said.The influencer — who did not want to be named, and who travelled to Turkey as part of a partnership to publicise the clinic — has not told his tens of thousands of followers of his problems for fear of being sued.Neither Sule Dental nor the Turkish health ministry responded to AFP requests for comment. For the victims, legal redress is scant and costly once they return home.“When a patient returns from Turkey or elsewhere with work already done, dentists refuse to touch them because you become responsible,” said the French dentists’ leader Solera.Just to repair the damage, Rida Azeem and Alana Boone have been quoted treatment costing $30,000, three to four times what they paid to have their work done in Turkey.Through dogged efforts, the British engineer managed to claw back $3,000 from the Istanbul clinic that disfigured her — not enough even for the dentures she had made in Pakistan to recover “90 percent” of her smile. The Turkish dentist did offer to treat her if she returned, “but I was too afraid”, she said.The clinic did not reply to AFP requests for comment. “If you want treatment, find your practitioner yourself, talk to them directly and don’t go without an online consultation,” said Turkish lawyer Burcu Holmgren from London Legal International.She said she has helped more than a dozen patients who have had problems with Turkish dental care get redress.“The process is very slow — it takes about two years,” she said, adding that she has won “96 percent” of her cases.Most cases end up with a financial settlement, without a dentist being struck off, she admitted.The head of the Istanbul Chamber of Dentists said she still believes in medical tourism, but is worried by the number of students wanting to get into the profession.In 2010 Turkey had 35 dental faculties — now there are 104. “We are creating future unemployed dentists,” said Aytac. “And if they find work, some unfortunately won’t be that concerned with ethics.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/how-bad-is-red-meat-for-you-health-risks-get-star-ratings/,Spanish baby gets groundbreaking intestinal transplant,1,"Paris, France (AFP) — Research about what is healthy comes so thick and fast — red meat can appear good for you one week, stroke-inducing the next — that a confused public often struggles to keep up.But a massive new review published on Monday aims to look beyond the latest study by evaluating the available evidence on a range of health topics and giving it a star rating.The US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), which has become a global reference for health statistics, analysed the existing research in 180 areas to find out how much a particular risk factor, such as smoking, is linked to a health outcome, such as lung cancer.The connection between smoking and lung cancer was given the highest five-star rating, as was the link between high blood pressure and heart disease, which means that the evidence is solid and unlikely to change in the future.However nearly two thirds of the risk-outcome relationships received only one or two stars, suggesting that the proof for a lot of widely believed health advice is weaker than might have been thought.For example, evidence for a connection between eating a lot of unprocessed red meat and having a stroke was given just one star, meaning there was “no evidence of an association”, the study said.The links between red meat and colon cancer, breast cancer, ischaemic heart disease and diabetes were all given two stars.Christopher Murray, IHME director and a senior author of several of the “Burden of Proof” studies published in the journal Nature Medicine, said he was “very surprised at how many of the diet risk-outcome relationships are relatively weak.”Murray told a press conference that the meta-analysis was prompted by concern that “everyone follows the latest published study,” even though the results often “swing from one end to the other”.The researchers looked at the existing research on the subjects, crunched the numbers to find consistency, then asked “what is the most conservative interpretation of the evidence?” Murray said. The researchers investigated how eating more vegetables affected a range of health outcomes, looking at 50 studies encompassing 4.6 million participants across 34 countries.Increasing the amount of vegetables people eat from zero to four a day led to a 23 percent decline in the risk of ischaemic stroke, with the connection getting three stars, IHME epidemiologist and study co-author Jeffrey Stanaway said.The link between eating vegetables and type two diabetes received only one star.But “even under the most conservative interpretation of the evidence, vegetable consumption is significantly associated with reduced chronic disease risk,” Stanaway said.Experts not involved in the research called it interesting, but warned against over simplification.Kevin McConway, a statistician at the UK’s Open University, worried that “a great deal is inevitably lost” when complex studies were boiled down to a star rating.Duane Mellor, a dietician at the UK’s Aston University, said the red meat research was “not that surprising” because it focused on unprocessed products.“Typically it is intake of processed red meat, such as bacon and sausages, which have been associated with a higher risk of disease, which these papers did not report on,” he said.The IHME said it plans to update its findings as new research comes in, hoping the new tool will guide the choices of the public and policymakers. It will also soon release findings about other health relationships including those involving alcohol, air pollution and further dietary factors."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/nursing-shortage-forces-emergency-room-closures-across-canada/,‘What have they done?’ Flip side of Turkey’s dental boom,1,"OTTAWA, Canada (AFP) — An acute nursing shortage is clogging or even closing hospital emergency rooms across Canada, pushing an already stressed national health system to the brink with potentially severe consequences for patient care.Burnout from the Covid-19 pandemic, abuse from patients and salary discontent have seen nursing staff quitting their jobs in droves, and experts say the situation is only likely to worsen.The impact on emergency care is such that Ottawa police recently had to take a shooting victim to hospital in their squad car, rather than wait for an ambulance, and an elderly woman who fell and broke her hip was forced to wait six hours for help from paramedics based 100 kilometers (62 miles) away.Over the summer and into the fall, staffing shortages meant dozens of emergency rooms were forced to close — sometimes for a night or a weekend, sometimes longer.Wait times to see an ER doctor have soared to 12, 16, 20 hours — or more.“They’re numb, deflated and feeling hopeless,” said Cathryn Hoy, president of the Ontario Nurses’ Association. Herself a nurse for 20 years, she described the situation as “critical.”Amelie Inard, 32, was taken to an ER in Montreal this week, in extreme pain and peeing blood.The place was packed, and an overwrought nurse told her to describe her condition “in one sentence, really quickly, because of how busy they were,” Inard said.She eventually left in frustration, without seeing a doctor.Hospital workloads are rising, Hoy said, along with patients’ exasperation over extended wait times, leading to a spiking of violence against nurses.Several nurses told AFP they had been punched, scratched or spat on, and had trays, dishes and feces thrown at them. In the capital Ottawa, ambulances were unavailable on more than 1,000 occasions from January to July, as paramedics were stuck waiting to unload patients at crowded ERs.A hospital in Peterborough, east of Toronto, in the past week was forced to treat patients on gurneys in the parking lot because its ER was full, said Hoy.In Manitoba, doctor Merril Pauls said there had been “multiple times throughout the summer when we had to shut down beds in the emergency room” at Winnipeg’s Health Sciences Centre because of the nursing shortage.On one recent Sunday, he said, “We had too many people coming in and had no place to put them. We literally were double-bunking critical patients in a resuscitation bay.“Our nurses are really working in crazy conditions.”It’s a “really significant phenomenon going on across the country,” the doctor added, and it’s “getting worse.” A recent survey by the Canadian Union of Public Employees, the country’s largest labor union, found that 87 percent of nurses have considered leaving their job “because of the thankless and grueling working conditions.”“Even new graduates are quitting,” Hoy said.Federal health minister Jean-Yves Duclos has vowed to make it easier for foreign credentials to be recognized. That could help 11,000 internationally trained doctors and nurses get jobs in their field in Canada.But that won’t be nearly enough, with 34,400 nursing positions now vacant, according to government data.Compounding the problem, many Canadians — like Inard — don’t have a family doctor and turn to emergency rooms for care.“It’s just so difficult to find a family doctor,” she said.And a frequent shortage of regular hospital beds often means long waits to transfer patients out of ERs to wards.Ontario passed a bill at the end of September permitting transfers of patients awaiting long-term care to facilities up to 150 kilometers away.Provincial Health Minister Sylvia Jones said it would “ease pressures on crowded emergency departments.”But critics say it could force frail, elderly people into care homes far from their loved ones.For now, almost everyone needing treatment is eventually seen. But delays can pose long-term consequences for patients’ health.“If a stroke patient doesn’t get access to a clot-busting medicine fast, brain cells will die and the patient will end up being more disabled than they would have been,” Pauls said.Serious infections can be deadly if not treated in time. So, too, can cancers and other diseases, he added.Pauls recalled routinely telling discharged patients “to come back if things get worse.”“But now they laugh at us. They say: ‘You’re crazy. There’s no way I’m going to go through this again.'”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/after-the-floods-a-wave-of-disease-plagues-pakistan/,How bad is red meat for you? Health risks get star ratings,1,"JOHI, Pakistan (AFP) — His head haloed by a whirlwind of mosquitoes, Aamir Hussain stands on the roof of his home in southern Pakistan surveying the fetid floodwaters all around.Four months after the start of record monsoon rains linked to climate change, the standing water has curdled into a pestilent soup breeding malaria, cholera and dengue.The UN has warned of a “second wave” of catastrophe, with the risk that deaths from water-borne disease and malnutrition will outstrip the 1,700 drowned and electrocuted in the initial cascade.As dusk arrives in Hussain’s submerged village in Dadu district of Sindh province, so do the bugs, and the gamble that they will infect his wife and two children.“The mosquitoes bite a lot and we fall sick,” said the 25-year-old, atop a brickwork compound framing a courtyard awash with putrid, sucking mud.His brother, who shares this home, has already ventured off the roof to treat his sick children at hospital with borrowed cash.“Some of our nets are torn now so we are worried,” said Hussain, whose infant son has fallen ill.Sindh has been worst-hit by the catastrophic flooding which put a third of Pakistan underwater, displaced eight million, destroyed or damaged two million homes, crippled 1,500 hospitals and clinics and caused an estimated $28 billion in damages. Climate change minister Sherry Rehman said this week that more than 20 million people are still in need “with futures that are entirely precarious”. Eight million of those require “urgent medical services”, she said.Zahida Mallah has already been tipped over the edge.In a bleak camp south of Dadu, outside the city of Hyderabad, the 35 year-old explained she is in mourning for her twin two-month-old sons.One died on the day AFP visited, the other around two weeks ago at a separate camp.They were killed by “colds”, she said, after sleeping out in the open. She was offered a tent only after it was too late.“We just keep floundering,” she lamented.Nearby, the city of Johi is corralled by water, accessible via a ramshackle flotilla of canoes powered by greasy petrol engines.Residents rallied to save the city as the rains lashed down, heaving sandbags into a snaking makeshift levee. But it cannot hold back the disease.In a desperately rundown emergency clinic, a doctor treats unresponsive seven year-old Kashaf, a suspected malaria patient lying on dirty sheets with a clutch of pharmaceuticals at her feet.“Perhaps it’s a natural disaster, or perhaps we are being tested by God, but whatever it is we are the victims,” said her father, 20 year-old Dildar Mastoi.Under a black scarf his daughter’s eyes have rolled back into her head. She no longer recognizes her parents — doctors say a fever has affected her brain.Barely adults themselves, her mother and father fled rising waters twice before settling in a camp where they drink from a well they suspect is contaminated by flood water.“From early evening until dawn, throughout the whole night, the mosquitoes are overwhelming,” said Kashaf’s mother, 19 year-old Bashiran Mastoi. “When the night approaches we start to worry.”“Life at the camp is immensely miserable,” she said in a vigil on her child’s sickbed.Medic Manzoor Shahani said there has been a “surge” in malaria, gastro illnesses, and dengue while “most of the patients are children and pregnant women”. Before the floods southern Pakistan was already devastated by grinding poverty. Now aid only sporadically penetrates the patchwork swampland, while the true number of those in need has yet to even be discovered.Doctors and officials offer contradicting figures, as they grapple to understand the scale. In Dadu the official death toll is just 23, but everyone privately agrees the real figure must be far higher.“This is devastation beyond the government’s approach,” said provincial health monitor Faheem Soomro, as young doctors tally the day’s fresh patients at a boardroom table.Half of malaria tests are coming back positive and most homes have suspected cases.Sindh has recorded 208,000 cases of malaria so far this year, a dramatic rise from 2021, when cases were reported.Left untreated — as it certainly is in the stranded swathes of Sindh — malaria can quickly turn fatal. In a normal year there are 50,000 deaths from malaria in Pakistan.Soomro describes it as “the hidden fever”. It has vague flu-like symptoms — as the mosquito-borne parasite enters the liver and bloodstream, in severe cases swelling the brain.The healthcare disaster is most easily monitored in camps — there are 19 in Dadu — where the luckiest of the displaced live in row upon row of hundreds of simple A-frame tents.In one of the “tent cities” home to around 5,000, residents clamor for treatment in a blustery gazebo where doctors test them for malnutrition and malaria, as others offer vaccinations and female health advice.Soomro estimates 60 percent of the displaced once stayed in camps like this, but three quarters of those have scattered back to the sodden hinterlands to remake their lives, often out of reach of aid efforts.Outside the camps the dispersed can be seen everywhere — in tents and on daybeds clustered by highways and near scummy stagnant lakes. The monsoon torrent came after Pakistan was seared by a spring heatwave, with pockets of Sindh sporadically suffering temperatures of 50C (122F).Extreme weather events are increasing in severity as a result of climate change, scientists say.Pakistan — the world’s fifth largest population — is responsible for only 0.8 percent of global greenhouse emissions but it’s one of the most vulnerable to extreme weather caused by global warming.In Johi, community activist Ali Pervez laments how the worst affected Pakistanis are unable to advocate for climate justice.“They are totally unaware,” he said.“There is not any quality education [so] that we can easily make aware, empower our people.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/medicine-prize-opens-nobel-week-clouded-by-war/,Nursing shortage forces emergency room closures across Canada,1,"STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AFP) — Breast cancer discoveries and mRNA vaccines are seen as possible winners when the Nobel Medicine Prize kicks off a week of winner announcements on Monday, with this year’s awards held under the shadow of war in Europe.Established more than 120 years ago before Europe was ravaged by two world wars, the Nobel prizes will celebrate those who have “conferred the greatest benefit on mankind” after a year marked by bloodshed and devastation in Ukraine.The Medicine Prize will be announced around 11:30 am (0930 GMT) in Stockholm on Monday, followed by the awards for physics on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday.The Peace Prize, the most highly anticipated of the awards and the only one announced in Oslo, will follow on Friday, with the Economics Prize wrapping things up on October 10.For medicine, one woman’s name keeps popping up among prize watchers: US geneticist Mary-Claire King, who in 1990 discovered the BRCA1 gene responsible for a hereditary form of breast cancer.She could be honored together with oncologists Dennis Slamon of the United States and Germany’s Axel Ullrich for their research, which led to the development of the breast cancer drug Herceptin.However, if the jury were to break with its tradition of honoring decades-old research, another woman could be well placed for her role in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. Already honored by almost all other major medicine prizes, Hungarian-born Katalin Kariko could win for her pioneering research which led directly to the first mRNA vaccines to fight Covid-19, made by Pfizer and Moderna.“There’s not only the direct benefit that it gave us to fight the pandemic, it’s also the first in a series of very promising applications using this technology,” Nobel watcher Ulrika Bjorksten, the head of Swedish public radio’s science service, told AFP.Kariko could be honored together with her collaborator Drew Weissman of the United States and Pieter Cullis of Canada.Last year, the prize went to US researchers David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian for their discoveries on human receptors for temperature and touch.David Pendlebury, who heads the closely watched Clarivate analytics group which lists dozens of possible winners for the Nobel science prizes, said his money was on King and Slamon this year.But he also mentioned Hong Kong molecular biologist Yuk Ming Dennis Lo, who pioneered the development of non-invasive prenatal testing.He also developed a new method of detecting cancer early using just a few drops of blood, dubbed liquid biopsies.With a simple blood draw “you can determine all kinds of possible problems and diseases”, Pendlebury said.Male researchers based in the United States have overwhelmingly dominated the Nobel science prizes through the years.The various prize committees have insisted they are trying to recognise women’s achievements, but say many of the top discoveries were made decades ago when fewer women were involved in high-level research.Last year, 12 men and one woman won Nobel Prizes, with all of the science nods going to men. For the Literature Prize on Thursday, literary critics told AFP they thought the Swedish Academy may go for a more mainstream author this year, after selecting lesser-known writers the past two years.Last year, Tanzanian author Abdulrazak Gurnah won, while US poet Louise Gluck was crowned in 2020.US novelist Joyce Carol Oates, France’s Annie Ernaux and Maryse Conde, Russia’s Lyudmila Ulitskaya and Canada’s Margaret Atwood have all been cited as potential laureates if the committee has its eyes on a woman.Online betting sites however have France’s Michel Houellebecq as the favorite, ahead of British author Salman Rushdie, who was the victim of an attempted murder attack in August.But it is the Peace Prize that is expected to hold special significance this year.After Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov won the prize last year together with his Philippine colleague Maria Ressa in the name of freedom of expression, will the Norwegian Nobel Committee award another anti-Putin prize after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine?Not since World War II has a conflict raged between two countries so close to Oslo.The International Criminal Court, tasked with investigating war crimes in Ukraine, and the International Court of Justice — both based in The Hague — have been mentioned as possible laureates this year.So have jailed Russian dissident Alexei Navalny and Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya.If the committee were to focus on the climate crisis, experts tipped Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, possibly together with British environmentalist David Attenborough or other activists such as Sudan’s Nisreen Elsaim and Ghana’s Chibeze Ezekiel.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/hackers-leak-french-hospital-patient-data-in-ransom-fight/,After the floods,1,"Évry, France (AFP) — Hackers who crippled a French hospital and stole a trove of data last month have released personal records of patients online, officials have confirmed.The cyberattackers demanded a multimillion dollar ransom from the Corbeil-Essonnes hospital near Paris a month ago, but the institution refused to pay.The hospital said the hackers had now dumped medical scans and lab analyses along with the national security numbers of patients.“I condemn in the strongest possible terms the unspeakable disclosure of hacked data,” health minister Francois Braun tweeted on Sunday.Hospitals around the world have been facing increasing attacks from ransomware groups, particularly since the pandemic stretched resources to breaking point.The problem has been acute in France, where officials estimated early last year that healthcare institutions were facing on average an attack every week.President Emmanuel Macron last year called the attacks during the pandemic a “crisis within a crisis” and announced an extra one billion euros for cybersecurity.During last month’s attack, the Corbeil-Essonnes hospital shut down its emergency services and sent many patients to other institutions.At one point, officials said the only technology still working was the telephone.Rather than selling the trove of data, the hacker has dumped at least some of it for download on the “dark web” — a hidden part of the internet that requires special software to access.Analysts said it seemed to be a tactic to put pressure on the hospital, even though public institutions are banned by French law from paying ransoms.Cybersecurity researcher Damien Bancal, who revealed the leak and has seen the files, told AFP the worry is that other criminals will now launch scams with the data that has already been divulged.In response to the leak on the weekend, the hospital severely restricted access to its systems and told patients to be extremely vigilant when receiving emails, text messages or phone calls."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/babies-in-the-womb-react-differently-to-flavors-researchers/,Babies in the womb react differently to flavors: researchers,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) – Babies in the womb are big fans of carrots but not so much leafy green vegetables — and show it in their faces, scientists said in a new study published Thursday.Researchers at Durham University in northeast England said the findings were the first direct evidence that babies react differently to various smells and tastes before they are born.A team of scientists studied 4D ultrasound scans of 100 pregnant women and discovered that babies exposed to carrot flavors showed “laughter-face” responses.Those exposed to kale flavors in contrast showed more “cry-face” responses.Lead postgraduate researcher Beyza Ustun said: “A number of studies have suggested that babies can taste and smell in the womb, but they are based on post-birth outcomes while our study is the first to see these reactions prior to birth.“As a result, we think that this repeated exposure to flavors before birth could help to establish food preferences post-birth, which could be important when thinking about messaging around healthy eating and the potential for avoiding ‘food-fussiness’ when weaning.”Humans experience flavor through a combination of taste and smell.In fetuses, it is thought that this might happen through inhaling and swallowing the amniotic fluid in the womb.The study, published in the journal Psychological Science, included scientists from Durham’s Fetal and Neonatal Research Lab and Aston University in Birmingham, central England.A team from the National Centre for Scientific Research in Burgundy, France, was also involved.The teams believe the findings could deepen understanding of the development of human taste and smell receptors as well as perception and memory.Research co-author Professor Jackie Blissett, of Aston University, said: “It could be argued that repeated prenatal flavor exposures may lead to preferences for those flavors experienced postnatally.“In other words, exposing the fetus to less ‘liked’ flavors, such as kale, might mean they get used to those flavors in utero.“The next step is to examine whether fetuses show less ‘negative’ responses to these flavors over time, resulting in greater acceptance of those flavors when babies first taste them outside of the womb.”str/phz/bp© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/global-fund-raises-14-25-billion-to-end-hiv-tb-and-malaria/,Global Fund raises $14.25 billion to end HIV,1,"NEW YORK, United States (AFP) — The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria raised $14.25 billion Wednesday at a donor conference led by US President Joe Biden, as decades of progress against the diseases are set back by Covid.It was the highest amount ever pledged for a multilateral health organization — but fell far short of the ambitious goal of $18 billion after the United Kingdom and Italy said their announcements would come later.The Global Fund was created in 2002, bringing together governments, multilateral agencies, civil society groups and the private sector. Funding cycles last three years.“What’s happened today is actually an unparalleled mobilization of resources for global health,” said Global Fund executive director Peter Sands, adding he expected Britain and Italy to make their pledges in due course.“Thank you all for stepping up, especially in a challenging global economic environment, and I ask you, keep it going,” urged Biden.Among countries, the United States pledged the highest amount, $6 billion, followed by France with 1.6 billion euros, 1.3 billion euros by Germany, $1.08 billion by Japan, Can$1.21 billion by Canada and 715 million Euros by the European Union.The Gates Foundation pledged $912 million.The $18-billion goal was based on getting back on track to end AIDS, TB and malaria by 2030, recovering ground lost during the Covid pandemic and saving 20 million lives over the next three years.The target was 30 percent more than that raised during the organization’s sixth and most recent replenishment, hosted by President Emmanuel Macron of France in 2019, which raised a then-record $14 billion.Camille Spire, president of the French non-profit AIDES, told AFP that when the UK and Italy make their pledges, the sum would still be unlikely to reach the original goal.“While some are counting their pennies, some are counting the dead,” she said, adding she was “angry” and the outcome would mean fewer screening campaigns than had been hoped for, fewer treatments, less funding for community health centers and less strengthening of health systems.There was also criticism within the UK. Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy tweeted the delay in pledging “will slow the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria and damage the UK’s national interest.” The fund estimates it has reduced the death toll from AIDS, TB, and malaria by 50 percent, saving more than 50 million lives over the past two decades.Last year, it warned that the Covid pandemic was having a devastating impact on its work, leading to declining results across the board for the first time in its history.It said in its latest report, however, that the massive resources it had pumped into countering the downturn had paid off and “recovery is underway” against all three diseases.The Global Fund provides 30 percent of all international financing for HIV programs, 76 percent of funding for TB, and 63 percent of funding for malaria.Its other areas of focus include improving the resilience of local health systems, and raising funds against Covid-19.According to US law, the country cannot provide more than one-third of funding for the Global Fund — a limit that serves as a matching challenge to other nations to double the American pledge.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/global-fund-seeks-18-billion-to-end-hiv-tb-and-malaria/,TB and malaria,1,"NEW YORK, United States (AFP) – The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria will hold a donor conference Wednesday in New York, where it aims to raise at least $18 billion during an event hosted by US President Joe Biden.It is the highest ever “replenishment” goal set by the organization and comes amid rising economic pressures — both on donor countries and recipients — following the Covid-19 pandemic and the food and energy crises caused by the Ukraine conflict.But spokeswoman Francoise Vanni told AFP she was buoyed by recent pledges — including most recently 1.3 billion euros from Germany, which followed $6 billion from the United States and $1.08 billion from Japan — that had brought the fund “about halfway” to its target.“There’s a lot at stake, and the $18 billion target is very much based on getting back on track to end AIDS, TB and malaria by 2030, recovering ground lost during the Covid pandemic and saving no less than 20 million lives over the next three years,” she said.“Everything is still at play and no decision has been made until it’s been made…But we have very strong pledges already in the bag.”The amount is 30 percent more than that raised during the organization’s sixth and most recent replenishment, hosted by President Emmanuel Macron of France in 2019, which raised a then-record $14 billion.The Global Fund was created in 2002 and brings together governments, multilateral agencies, bilateral partners, civil society groups, and the private sector to tackle the three deadly diseases, with new funding cycles usually every three years.Vanni said she hoped donors would look at the fund’s track record of success — last week it announced it had helped save 50 million lives over the past 20 years.What’s more, “countries around the world realize that no one is safe until everyone is safe. We’ve been saying that during Covid-19, and we cannot lose that momentum.”– Signs of recovery – Last year, the Global Fund warned that the pandemic was having a “devastating” impact on its work, leading to declining results across the board for the first time in the fund’s history.But it said last week that the massive resources it had pumped to counter the downturn had paid off and “recovery is underway” against all three diseases.For example, the number of people dying from TB rose for the first time in a decade in 2020, when it caused an estimated 1.5 million deaths, making it the world’s second biggest infectious disease killer behind Covid.But the Global Fund, which provides 76 percent of all international financing for fighting TB, said the programs had shown signs of recovery last year.Similarly, the number of people reached with HIV prevention services rose again after dropping in 2020, reaching 12.5 million people worldwide, it said. The fund provides nearly a third of all international financing to battle HIV.Per an act of Congress, the United States cannot provide more than one-third of funding for the Global Fund — a limit that serves as a matching challenge to other nations to double the American pledge.ia/des/ssy© Agence France-Presse"

We still have a problem with Covid. We’re still doing a lot of work on it…, but the pandemic is over,” Biden told the CBS news program “60 Minutes” in an interview taped as he walked the floor of the Detroit Auto Show last week.“If you notice, no one’s wearing masks,” Biden said, gesturing around the hall.“Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so, I think it’s changing.”The president’s remarks, however, come only a few weeks after his administration asked Congress for billions of dollars in funding to maintain its testing and vaccine programs through a potential fall wave.The visit to Michigan last week by Biden, a self-professed “car guy,” boosted the profile of the Detroit gathering, which is being held for the first time since 2019.In a keynote speech, Biden highlighted recent legislation passed to support US automakers’ shift to electric vehicles, as well as major new investments in semiconductor production.sms-des/bfm© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-monkeypox-death-as-virus-linked-to-brain-inflammation/,Biden says Covid pandemic in US ‘is over’,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — A second US death was linked to monkeypox on Tuesday as health authorities published a study describing how two previously healthy young men experienced inflammation of the brain and spinal cord as a result of the virus.There have been nearly 22,000 US cases in the current global outbreak, which began in May, but new infections have been falling since mid-August as authorities have distributed hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses.The latest fatal case involved a severely immunocompromised resident of Los Angeles County who had been hospitalized, the local health department said, without revealing further details about the case.“Persons severely immunocompromised who suspect they have monkeypox are encouraged to seek medical care and treatment early and remain under the care of a provider during their illness,” the department said.The first US death linked to the viral illness occurred in Texas and was announced on August 30, although authorities said that as the person was severely immunocompromised, they were investigating what role monkeypox had played.The current global outbreak is primarily affecting men who have sex with men.Historically, the virus has been spread via direct contact with lesions, body fluids and respiratory droplets, and sometimes through indirect contamination via surfaces such as shared bedding.But in this outbreak, there is preliminary evidence that sexual transmission may also play a role. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meanwhile published a report about two unvaccinated men in their 30s who experienced brain and spinal cord inflammation after testing positive for the virus.The first, patient A, was a gay man in his 30s from Colorado whose symptoms began with fever chills and malaise but progressed to rashes on his face, scrotum and extremities, with swabs of lesions testing positive for the virus.He also developed lower extremity weakness and numbness, was unable to empty his bladder, experienced a persistent and painful erection, and was hospitalized.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed brain and spinal cord inflammation, and he was treated with the oral monkeypox antiviral tecovirimat as well as other drugs, and began to improve at two weeks.He was released but continued to have left leg weakness and required an assistive walking device at one month follow-up.A second person, patient B, was also a gay man in his 30s from the capital Washington. His fever, rashes and muscle pain progressed to bowel and bladder incontinence and progressive flaccid weakness of both legs.Brain and spinal cord inflammation was confirmed on MRI and he was intubated in an intensive care unit, where he was treated with intravenous tecovirimat, as well a drug to reduce inflammation, and finally blood plasma exchange.He remains in hospital but can walk with the assistance of a device.The report said the underlying mechanism behind the two cases was unclear — it might have been direct invasion of the central nervous system, or an autoimmune response triggered by monkeypox infection elsewhere in the body.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/syria-cholera-outbreak-at-risk-of-spreading-who/,S.Africa reports two deaths linked to Covid vaccine,1,"BEIRUT, Lebanon (AFP) – The World Health Organization warned Tuesday of a “very high” risk of cholera spreading across Syria after the country recorded its first cases since 2009.“The risk of cholera spreading to other governorates is very high,” the WHO said, after cases were recorded in at least five of the country’s 14 provinces.“The source of infection could be linked to people drinking water from untreated sources,” or “food contamination due to irrigating plants with contaminated water,” the WHO said in a statement.On Monday, the Syrian health ministry reported two cholera deaths in government-held areas.On Saturday, Kurdish authorities reported three deaths in areas of northern and eastern Syria under their control.The WHO said the cases were the first reported in Syria since 2009, when 342 cases were confirmed in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor and the northern province of Raqa.The disease is generally contracted from contaminated food or water and causes diarrhea and vomiting.It can spread in residential areas that lack proper sewerage networks or mains drinking water.A decade of civil war has damaged two thirds of Syria’s water treatment plants, half of its pumping stations and one third of its water towers, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has said.Nearly half the population relies on alternative and often unsafe sources of water while at least 70 percent of sewage goes untreated, it added.The UN issued an urgent appeal to donor countries on Monday for additional funding to battle the outbreak.“The outbreak presents a serious threat to people in Syria and the region,” the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Syria, Imran Riza said.“Swift and urgent action is needed to prevent further illness and death.”The UN said the source of the outbreak “is believed to be linked to people drinking unsafe water from the Euphrates River and using contaminated water to irrigate crops, resulting in food contamination.”An outbreak of cholera hit neighboring Iraq this summer for the first time since 2015.Worldwide, the disease affects between 1.3 million and four million people each year, killing between 21,000 and 143,000 people.aya/kir© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/new-malaria-vaccine-results-raise-hopes-of-mass-rollout/,US monkeypox death as virus linked to brain inflammation,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) – A booster dose of a new malaria vaccine maintains a high level of protection against the disease, researchers said Thursday, expressing hopes the cheap jab could be produced on a massive scale in a matter of years.The international research team suggested the vaccine, developed by Britain’s Oxford University, could represent a turning point in the fight against the mosquito-borne parasitic disease, which killed 627,000 people — mostly African children — in 2020 alone.Last year a different vaccine produced by British pharmaceutical giant GSK became the first to be recommended for widespread use against malaria by the World Health Organization, and has now been administered to more than a million children in Africa.However research has found that the effectiveness of GSK’s vaccine is around 60 percent, and significantly wanes over time even with a booster dose.Oxford’s R21/Matrix-M vaccine meanwhile was found to be 77 percent effective at preventing malaria in research published last year — the first time the WHO’s roadmap goal of 75 percent had been met.– ‘Fantastic’ – For the research, 450 children aged five to 17 months in Burkina Faso — where malaria accounts for around 22 percent of all deaths — were given three doses in 2019.They were split into three groups, two receiving different doses of the Matrix-M adjuvant, a vaccine ingredient patented by Novavax also used in the US biotech firm’s Covid jab. The third control group received a rabies vaccine.Ahead of the 2020 rainy season — when malaria cases surge — 409 children returned to get a booster shot.For the group that received the higher dose of adjuvant, the booster rose the protection level to 80 percent, according to the results of a phase 2b trial published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal on Thursday. The lower dose had 70 percent efficacy.And crucially, the booster returned antibody levels to a similar level seen after the first round of doses, the study said.The study’s lead investigator Halidou Tinto of the Burkina Faso health research institute IRSS said, “It is fantastic to see such high efficacy again after a single booster dose.”Tinto, who was involved in trialling both malaria vaccines, said GSK’s vaccine had an optimal efficacy of around 60 percent. “So I can confirm that R21 is doing much better,” he told a press conference.– 70% reduction in deaths? – Oxford vaccinologist and study co-author Adrian Hill said the vaccine meant “We really could be looking at a very substantial reduction in that horrendous burden of malaria, deaths and disease in the coming years, certainly by 2030.”A 70 percent reduction in deaths from malaria could be feasible in that time, he said, partly because of the vast number of vaccine doses that could be quickly produced.Oxford has partnered with the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India.The institute is “willing and able to manufacture 200 million doses a year starting next year,” Hill said.The six to 10 million doses that GSK can produce a year is “not enough for 40 million children who need four doses in the first year,” Hill added.And the Oxford vaccine would likely cost a few US dollars a dose, less than half the $9 for GSK’s version, he said.The challenge of getting those doses into arms would require more funding, he added.Results from a phase three trial involving 4,800 participants across four countries are expected later this year, which could potentially lead to approval.Azra Ghani, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London not involved in the research, welcomed the results, saying it was “particularly encouraging” the booster dose restored protective antibodies.Gareth Jenkins of the charity Malaria No More UK said the results were “another encouraging signal that, with the right support, the world could end child deaths from malaria in our lifetimes”.Jenkins said in a statement that new British Prime Minister Liz Truss’ “first foreign policy test” was to ensure continued funding at the replenishment conference for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria being held in the US this month.dl/bp© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/sweeteners-may-be-linked-to-heart-disease-risk-study-suggests/,Syria cholera outbreak at risk of spreading: WHO,1,"PARIS, France (AFP ) – A large study suggested Thursday that artificial sweetener could be associated with a higher risk of heart disease, however experts urged caution about the findings.Sweeteners are consumed by millions every day in products like diet soda, partly as a way to avoid weight gain from sugar — but the healthiness of these substitutes has long been a matter of controversy.Aiming to assess the heart disease risk of sweeteners, researchers at the French INSERM institute analysed the data of more than 100,000 adults in France who self-reported their diet, lifestyle and medical history between 2009-2021 as part of the NutriNet-Sante study.Thirty-seven percent of the participants consumed artificial sweeteners, with an average intake of 42 milligrams a day — the equivalent of one packet of sweetener or about a third of a can of diet soda.During the nine-year follow-up period, 1,502 heart problems were recorded, including heart attack, angina and stroke.The research, published in the journal BMJ, indicated that heart disease occurred in 346 out of 100,000 people who consume a high level of sweetener, compared to 314 per 100,000 for non-consumers.“These results, in line with the latest WHO report published this year, do not support the use of sweeteners as a safe alternative to sugar,” said INSERM’s Mathilde Touvier, who coordinated the study.An April report from the World Health Organization said that “there is no clear consensus on whether non-sugar sweeteners are effective for long-term weight loss or maintenance, or if they are linked to other long-term health effects”.Another study published earlier this year using Nutri-Net data found a correlation between cancer and sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium and sucralose.However such observational studies have come under increased criticism because they cannot establish the cause of the differences they find, which could come from other sources.Naveed Sattar, a professor of metabolic medicine at Glasgow University not involved in the sweetener study, said that it “cannot answer the question posed”.“This is because there are clearly major differences in many characteristics of people who consume artificial sweeteners compared to those who do not consume any,” he said.He called for governments to fund long-term, randomised trials “to get closer to the truth”.ic/dl/rox© Agence France-Presse"

(Bivalent means the jab targets both the original and new strains).Britain has also approved the new Moderna vaccine, while the United States and the European Union have approved both the new Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech Omicron jabs.Canadian Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said the bivalent Moderna Spikevax vaccine “is anticipated to provide stronger and broader protection, including against the Omicron variants that have been circulating.”It is the first bivalent shot to be authorized for use in Canada. Pfizer-BioNTech are awaiting approval of their own version of an Omicron-targeting booster and are expected to make new submissions soon, a public health official told a briefing.Canada has already purchased 12 million doses of the new Moderna jab, which are expected to be made available to the public at the end of September.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged all Canadians to “get out and get vaccinated.”“Covid is not done with us,” he told reporters in Winnipeg, Manitoba where he met with a group of nursing students. “As winter comes and people get pushed back indoors there is a real risk of another serious wave of Covid.”According to government data, 86 percent of eligible Canadians or about 31 million people have received two Covid jabs.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/treatment-improves-cognition-in-down-syndrome-patients/,study suggests,1,"Paris, France (AFP) – A new hormone treatment improved the cognitive function of six men with Down Syndrome by 10-30 percent, scientists said Thursday, adding the “promising” results may raise hopes of improving patients’ quality of life.However the scientists emphasised the small study did not point towards a cure for the cognitive disorders of people with Down Syndrome and that far more research is needed.“The experiment is very satisfactory, even if we remain cautious,” said Nelly Pitteloud of Switzerland’s Lausanne University Hospital and co-author of a new study in the journal Science.Down Syndrome is the most common genetic form of intellectual disability, occurring in around one in 1,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.Yet previous research has failed to significantly improve cognition when applied to people with the condition, which is why the latest findings are “particularly important”, the study said.Recent discoveries have suggested that how the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is produced in the brain can affect cognitive functioning such as memory, language and learning.GnRH hormones regulate how much testosterone and estrogen is produced and increased levels of it help spur puberty.“We wondered if this hormone could play any role in establishing the symptoms of people with Down Syndrome,” said Vincent Prevot, study co-author and head of neuroscience research at France’s INSERM institute.– Mice research – The team first established that five strands of microRNA regulating the production of GnRH were dysfunctional in mice specifically engineered for Down Syndrome research.They then demonstrated that cognitive deficiencies — as well as loss of smell, a common symptom of Down Syndrome — were linked to dysfunctioning GnRH secretion in the mice.The team then gave the mice a GnRH medication used to treat low testosterone and delayed puberty in humans, finding that it restored some cognitive function and sense of smell.A pilot study was conducted in Switzerland involving seven men with Down Syndrome aged 20 to 50.They each received the treatment through their arm every two hours over a period of six months, with the drug delivered in pulses to mimic the hormone’s frequency in people without Down Syndrome.Cognition and smell tests were carried out during the treatment, as were MRI scans.Six of the seven men showed improvement in cognition with no significant side effects — however none showed a change in their sense of smell.“We have seen an improvement of between 10-30 percent in cognitive functions, in particular with visuospatial function, three-dimensional representation, understanding of instructions as well as attention,” Pitteloud said.The patients were asked to draw a simple 3D bed at several stages throughout the therapy. Many struggled at the beginning but by the end the efforts were noticeably better.– ‘Improve quality of life’ – The authors acknowledged some limitations of the study, including its size and that the choice of patients was “pushed by their parents”.“The clinical trial only focused on seven male patients — we still have a lot of work to do to prove the effectiveness of GnRH treatment for Down Syndrome,” Pitteloud said.A larger study involving a placebo and 50 to 60 patients, a third of them women, is expected to begin in the coming months.“We are not going to cure the cognitive disorders of people with Down Syndrome, but the improvement seen in our results already seems fundamental enough to hope to improve their quality of life,” Pitteloud said.Fabian Fernandez, an expert in cognition and Down Syndrome at the University of Arizona who was not involved in the research, hailed the “tour de force study”.He told AFP that while it is “difficult to envision” how such an intensive treatment could be used for young people, it might be better suited to delay the Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia suffered by many adults with Down Syndrome.It was also difficult to predict how such an improvement could impact the lives of people with the condition, he said.“For some, it could be significant, however, as it would enable them to be more independent with daily living activities such as maintaining and enjoying hobbies, finding belongings, using appliances in the home, and travelling alone.”ito-dl/rl/bp© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-cdc-recommends-boosters-targeting-omicron/,US CDC recommends boosters targeting Omicron,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday recommended Covid-19 booster shots from Pfizer and Moderna targeting the Omicron variant, clearing the way for the administration of the shots.This new generation of anti-Covid vaccines targets both the original strain of coronavirus and the BA.4 and BA.5 lineages, the subvariants of Omicron that are causing the most cases in the United States.The Pfizer-BioNTech shot is recommended for people 12 and older and Moderna’s for those 18 years and up.“The updated Covid-19 boosters are formulated to better protect against the most recently circulating Covid-19 variant. They can help restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination and were designed to provide broader protection against newer variants,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.“This recommendation followed a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion,” she added.The new versions of the vaccines — which were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday — could potentially be available in the United States as early as next week.The vaccines currently in circulation target the initial strain of the virus that first appeared in Wuhan, China. But they have gradually proven to be less effective against the variants that have appeared over time, due to rapid evolution of the virus.In contrast to the Alpha and Delta variants, which eventually waned, Omicron and its subvariants have come to dominate infections worldwide in 2022."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/beginning-of-the-end-patients-hail-new-treatment-for-drug-resistant-tb/,six others ill,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) – Volodymyr is celebrating a major milestone on Wednesday — it’s his final day of taking a new treatment hailed as a turning point in the fight against drug-resistant tuberculosis.The 25-year-old doctor in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv said he had nasty neurological side effects when he was on a previous drug regimen, which takes up to two years, involves a huge number of pills and is less than 60-percent effective.But the new treatment course took just six months, and gave him very few side effects. “It was very easy,” he told AFP.A scan on Wednesday showed he was clear of tuberculosis, and he plans to start work next week after eight months off sick.“Now I can start life again,” said Volodymyr, who did not give his last name.Tuberculosis, once called consumption, was the world’s biggest infectious killer before the arrival of Covid-19, with 1.5 million people dying from the disease each year.Around five percent of new cases are resistant to commonly prescribed antibiotics, making them difficult to treat.However a new drug regimen, called BPaL because it combines the antibiotics bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid, has been seen as a breakthrough since it was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019.– From 23 to five pills a day – Research in 2020 showed that the BPaL regimen cured more than 90 percent of drug-resistant patients, however there was a high rate of side effects linked to linezolid, including nerve pain and bone marrow suppression.But a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday indicated that the dosage of linezolid can be halved.A trial involving 181 participants with drug-resistant tuberculosis was carried out in Russia, South Africa, Georgia and Moldova — all countries with high TB rates.It found that while 1,200 milligrams of linezolid over six months had a cure rate of 93 percent, that number only dropped to 91 percent if the dosage was halved to 600 milligrams.The number of participants with the side of peripheral neuropathy — which causes nerve pain — fell from 38 to 24 percent at the lower dosage, while the rate of bone marrow suppression dropped from 22 to two percent.The study’s lead author, Francesca Conradie of South Africa’s University of the Witwatersrand, said she was “overwhelmed with how successful this regimen was”.“This is the beginning of the end of drug-resistant TB,” she told AFP.“The quicker you treat someone’s TB, the less infectious they are — it’s like Covid in many ways.”It is also far easier for patients to take BPaL, she added, saying previous courses could involve 23 pills a day — and up to 14,000 total pills over the maximum two-year course.BPaL involves five pills a day — and fewer than 750 over six months.– Could TB surpass Covid? – Nataliia Lytvynenko, who has overseen BPaL treatments in Ukraine, said the more manageable amount of pills meant it was easier for patients to continue treatment after being displaced by the war in her country.The World Health Organization indicated earlier this year that it would soon update its guidelines to recommend most patients with drug-resistant TB use BPaL with 600 milligrams of linezolid.Two experts not involved in Wednesday’s study said the research and the WHO guidance were “major advances”.The BPaL treatment “is one of the defining achievements of the tuberculosis research community in this century,” Guy Thwaites of Britain’s Oxford University and Nguyen Viet Nhung of Vietnam’s National Tuberculosis Control Programme wrote in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine.The advances come amid warnings that the pandemic has stalled progress against tuberculosis.“I very much worry that TB will — whether it’s this year or next — again become the largest single killer of any infectious disease in the world,” said Mel Spigelman, the president of the non-profit TB Alliance which funded the research.Volodymyr meanwhile said he hoped that progress would continue so the treatment timeline gets even shorter.“Maybe it will be two months — or even one,” he said with a smile.dl/jj© Agence France-Presse"

We really need to take stock of where we are. We should not be in a position with 14,000 or 15,000 people dying every week. We just shouldn’t.”Van Kerkhove insisted that the pandemic was not over, but it could be brought to an end while people continue to live their daily lives.“We just need to put a little extra thought into that, of being a bit more careful,” she said.“A lot of people are talking about living with Covid. But we need to live with this responsibly.“A million deaths this year is not living with Covid. Having 15,000 deaths per week is not living with Covid-19 responsibly.”Nearly 6.45 million deaths have been reported to the WHO since the virus was first detected in China in late 2019.More than 5.3 million new cases were reported to the UN health agency last week.“These are huge numbers, and that’s an underestimate,” said Van Kerkhove, with home testing not being reflected in surveillance data.“We do see this virus circulating really intensely around the world.“The virus is not going away, unfortunately.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/moderna-sues-pfizer-biontech-over-covid-vaccine/,Time for Covid reality check after 1 million deaths this year: WHO,1,"Moderna said Friday it is suing rival vaccine makers Pfizer and BioNTech, alleging the partners infringed on its patents in developing their Covid-19 shot administered to hundreds of millions around the world.The lawsuits set up a high-stakes showdown between the leading manufacturers of Covid-19 shots that are a key tool in the fight against the disease.“Moderna believes that Pfizer and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine Comirnaty infringes patents Moderna filed between 2010 and 2016 covering Moderna’s foundational mRNA technology,” the US-based biotech firm said in a statement.“Pfizer and BioNTech copied this technology, without Moderna’s permission, to make Comirnaty,” Moderna alleged.Pfizer and BioNTech said they were aware of the litigation, and each issued statements denying any wrongdoing.“BioNTech’s work is original, and we will vigorously defend against all allegations of patent infringement,” the firm said, adding it “respects valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others.”Pfizer pledged to “vigorously defend against the allegations of the lawsuit.”The mRNA technology used in the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech shots differs from that in traditional vaccines, which rely on injecting weakened or dead forms of a virus to allow the immune system to recognize it and build antibodies.Instead, mRNA vaccines deliver instructions to cells to build a harmless piece of the spike protein found on the surface of the virus that causes Covid-19.After creating this spike protein, cells can recognize and fight the real virus, hailed as a major advancement in development of vaccines. The shots have repeatedly been the subject of inaccurate claims that they are dangerous, but health authorities say they are safe and effective.The lawsuits — in US district court in Massachusetts, and in regional court in Dusseldorf, Germany — are not seeking the removal of the rival vaccine or an injunction on future sales.Moderna said it had begun building up the technology in 2010 and patented work on corona viruses in 2015 and 2016, which allowed for rollout of its shots in “record time” after the pandemic struck.The virus has killed at least 6.48 million people worldwide since 2020 and made nearly 600 million ill, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker.In addition to death and suffering, the disease has led to a re-shaping of life ranging from a change in norms on working from home to a scrambling of supply chains and workforces.Moderna said it pledged in October 2020 not to enforce its Covid-19-related patents while the pandemic continued, but less than two years later changed that stance as the fight shifted gears.“Moderna expected companies such as Pfizer and BioNTech to respect its intellectual property rights and would consider a commercially reasonable license should they request one for other markets,” it said.“Pfizer and BioNTech have failed to do so,” the firm added.These types of lawsuits are not unheard of in the pharmaceutical industry, where patents can be worth billions of dollars, and can take years to resolve.“It is an unfortunate but rather regular occurrence that other companies make allegations that a successful product potentially infringes their intellectual property rights,” BioNTech said in a statement."

Iran and Indonesia reported their first cases in the past seven days.Sixteen countries have not reported new cases for more than 21 days, the maximum incubation period of the disease.Among cases with sexual orientation reported, 96 percent identified as men who had sex with men. The median age of cases was 36.A sexual encounter was the most commonly reported type of transmission, at 82 percent.“The majority of cases were likely exposed in a party setting with sexual contacts,” said the WHO.Among cases with known HIV status, 45 percent are HIV positive, it added. © Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/anthony-fauci-face-of-us-covid-fight-to-step-down-in-december/,Global monkeypox cases dropped last week: WHO,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) – Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert who became the face of America’s fight against Covid-19, announced Monday he will leave government service after more than 50 years in December, stepping down as advisor to President Joe Biden.In the chaotic early days of the pandemic, Fauci became the nation’s most trusted expert on Covid — but his clashes with former president Donald Trump over the virus response drew anger from the right, and he now lives with security protection following death threats against his family.The 81-year-old, who has served under seven presidents beginning with Ronald Reagan, said in a statement he would be leaving both his position as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and that of chief medical advisor to Biden.But he added: “I am not retiring.” Instead Fauci, who had said he would leave by the end of Biden’s current term, said he now intended to “pursue the next chapter of my career.”Biden extended his “deepest thanks” to Fauci in a White House statement, adding that the country is “stronger, more resilient, and healthier because of him.”Fauci has helmed the United States’ response to infectious disease outbreaks since the 1980s, from HIV/AIDS to Covid.When the coronavirus first spread globally from China in 2020, he became a credible source of reliable information, reassuring the public with his calm and professorial demeanor during frequent media appearances.His straight-talking approach won him legions of fans, who bought T-shirts and bobbleheads in his likeness and made cocktails named after him.“I will always be grateful that we had a once-in-a-century public health leader to guide us through a once-in-a-century pandemic,” tweeted former president Barack Obama upon news Fauci was stepping down.But his honest takes on America’s early failures to get to grips with the virus soon brought Fauci into conflict with Trump. The White House at one point barred him from doing TV interviews and launched a media blitz against him.The clash helped turn him into a hate figure for many on the right — already incensed by the pandemic protections Fauci was advocating, from masks and vaccines to lockdown measures.“Dr. Fauci lost the trust of the American people when his guidance unnecessarily kept schools closed and businesses shut,” Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted Monday.In emotional testimony earlier this year, Fauci slammed another prominent Republican, the vaccine skeptic Senator Rand Paul, for unleashing “crazies” against him, recounting “threats upon my life, harassment of my family, and my children with obscene phone calls.”This month a West Virginia man was sentenced to three years in prison for threatening to drag Fauci and his family into the street and beat them to death.But despite the threats, Fauci has been conciliatory towards Trump, telling Politico that they developed “an interesting relationship.”– ‘Honor of a lifetime’ – It was not the first time Fauci faced criticism and clashes. In the 1980s he became a lightning rod for accusations the government was not doing enough to stem the rise of HIV/AIDS — but he later forged a close collaboration with activists.His accomplishments include implementing a fast-track system that widened access to antiretroviral medicines, and working with former president George H.W. Bush to plow in more resources.Later, under president George W. Bush, Fauci was the architect of a relief plan credited with saving millions of lives in sub-Saharan Africa.As a scientist, he is credited with developing effective treatments for formerly fatal inflammatory diseases, as well as for contributions into understanding how HIV destroys the body’s defenses.Despite his many duties, he had continued to treat patients at the NIH’s Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. It was not clear if that was part of his plans going forward.Biden said that after winning the 2020 election, as he built a team to lead the Covid-19 response, Fauci was “one of my first calls.”“I’ve been able to call him at any hour of the day for his advice,” the president stated.Fauci said it had been the “honor of a lifetime” to lead the NIAID, which he has done since 1984.He did not spell out what he will do next, but said he wants to inspire and mentor the next generation, citing the “energy and passion” he still has for the field despite his decades of service.“I am proud to have been part of this important work,” he said.st-la/ec/mlm© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/first-case-of-human-to-animal-transmission-who-urges-caution-after-dog-catches-monkeypox/,Burkina Faso builds first own drug manufacturing plant,1,"The World Health Organization called Wednesday for people infected with monkeypox to avoid exposing animals to the virus following a first reported case of human-to-dog transmission.A first case of human-to-dog transmission of monkeypox — between two men and their Italian greyhound living together in Paris — was reported last week in the medical journal The Lancet.“This is the first case reported of human-to-animal transmission… and we believe it is the first instance of a canine being infected,” Rosamund Lewis, the WHO’s technical lead for monkeypox, told reporters.Experts had been aware of the theoretical risk that such a jump could happen, she said, adding that public health agencies had already been advising those suffering from the disease to “isolate from their pets”.She also said “waste management is critical” to lowering the risk of contaminating rodents and other animals outside the household. When viruses jump the species barrier it often sparks concern that they could mutate dangerously.Lewis stressed that so far there were no reports that was happening with monkeypox.But she acknowledged that “as soon as the virus moves into a different setting in a different population, there is obviously a possibility that it will develop differently and mutate differently”.The main concern revolves around animals outside of the household.“The more dangerous situation… is where a virus can move into a small mammal population with high density of animals,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told reporters.“It is through the process of one animal infecting the next and the next and the next that you see rapid evolution of the virus.”He stressed though that there was little cause for concern around household pets.“I don’t expect the virus to evolve any more quickly in one single dog than in one single human,” he said, adding that while “we need to remain vigilant… pets are not a risk.”Monkeypox was originally identified in monkeys kept for research in Denmark in 1958, though it is found most frequently in rodents.The disease was first discovered in humans in 1970, with the spread since then mainly limited to certain West and Central African countries.But in May, cases of the disease, which causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions, began spreading rapidly around the world, mainly among men who have sex with men.Worldwide, more than 35,000 cases have been confirmed since the start of the year in 92 countries, and 12 people have died, according to the WHO, which has designated the outbreak a global health emergency. With global case numbers jumping by 20 percent in the past week alone, the UN health agency is urging all countries to do more to rein in the spread, including ensuring at-risk populations have access to services and information about the dangers and how to protect themselves.There is also a vaccine, originally developed for smallpox, but it is in short supply.Lewis also stressed that there was still little data on the effectiveness of the vaccine in protecting against monkeypox in the current outbreak.While no randomised control trials had been conducted yet, she said there were reports of breakthrough cases following vaccination, indicating “the vaccine is not 100 percent”.Pointing to limited studies in the 1980s suggesting that the smallpox vaccines used at the time might offer 85-percent protection against monkeypox, she said the breakthrough cases were “not really a surprise”.“But it reminds us that the vaccine is not a silver bullet,” she said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-makes-hearing-aids-over-the-counter-to-curb-costs/,Anthony Fauci,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) – Over-the-counter hearing aids will for the first time be available to tens of millions of Americans, officials said Tuesday, in an effort to cut prices from $5,000 a pair.“For many Americans who suffer from hearing loss, safe and effective and high quality hearing aids have been unaffordable,” health secretary Xavier Becerra told reporters in a briefing.The action, which should take effect in October, would reduce the cost of hearing aids by an estimated $2,800 per pair, by removing the requirement to see a doctor or audiologist, added Brian Deese, director of the White House’s National Economic Council.This, he said, amounted to what economists call a “barrier to entry” — regulation that prevents more companies from entering the market.At present, hearing aids cost in the region of $5,000 per pair in the United States. Though a small portion of the cost may be offset by health insurance, it still stands in contrast to other advanced countries such as Britain, where the devices are free at the point of delivery.Children, as well as people with severe hearing loss, would still need a prescription. While hearing loss in adults is generally caused by noise exposure and aging, the reasons among children can be more concerning and require closer medical evaluation.President Joe Biden, who had called for the move in an executive order issued last year, said in a statement the rule “makes good on my commitment to lower costs for American families… giving people more choices to improve their health and wellbeing.”One in eight people in the United States aged 12 years or older — around 30 million people — has hearing loss in both ears, based on standard hearing examinations, according to the Food and Drug Administration.The new rule applies to hearing aids that work through air conduction, bringing amplified sound into the ear canal where it moves through the eardrum and the middle ear to reach the inner ear, where the processed signal is sent to the brain.People with more severe hearing loss may require bone conduction hearing aids that bypass the outer and middle ear.ia/mlm© Agence France-Presse"

Once very common it can now be prevented with a vaccine.In April, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Africa was facing an explosion of preventable diseases due to delays in vaccinating children, with measles cases jumping 400 percent.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/uk-clears-new-moderna-vaccine-targeting-omicron-variant/,to step down in December,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — The UK’s drug regulator said Monday it had approved an updated Moderna vaccine against Covid-19 that targets the Omicron variant as well as the original form of the virus.The Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said in a statement said it had approved the vaccine for adult booster doses “after it was found to meet the UK regulator’s standards of safety, quality and effectiveness”.It was the first such “bivalent” Covid-19 vaccine to be approved by the British regulator.The MHRA’s chief executive June Raine said data from a clinical trial had shown it prompted a “strong immune response” against the original virus and Omicron and would provide a “sharpened tool in our armoury” as the virus kept evolving.Moderna’s CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement that the US biotech company was “delighted” by the decision, “the first authorization of an Omicron-containing bivalent vaccine”.While vaccines have helped lower hospitalisations and deaths from Covid, which first emerged in China in late 2019, the current jabs are mainly aimed at the earlier strains of the disease.The World Health Organization warned in July that the pandemic was “nowhere near over”, due to the spread of Omicron subvariants and to the lifting of control measures.Half of the Moderna vaccine targets the original 2020 virus and half the Omicron variant, which is officially known as BA.1. The MHRA said the vaccine was also found to generate a “good response” against two Omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5, which have partly driven a wave of new cases of the disease in Europe and the United States.The vaccine had the same “typically mild” side effects as the original Moderna jab, it added.Moderna said in June that its “bivalent” vaccine performed better against both Omicron and the original virus compared to its original Covid vaccine, called Spikevax.The EU’s medicines watchdog said that month it had started to review the new shot.Moderna said it had also submitted the vaccine to regulators in Australia and Canada and was expecting further authorisation decisions in the coming weeks.The European medical agency is also studying a rival adapted jab developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, which may be approved this autumn.The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is adapted for the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the virus.They were first discovered in South Africa and spread rapidly despite high population immunity conferred by prior waves and vaccinations.Like other Omicron subvariants, they tend to have a milder disease course as they settle less in the lungs and more in the upper nasal passages, causing symptoms such as fever, tiredness and loss of smell."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/southern-hemisphere-to-get-first-mrna-vaccine-facility/,Southern hemisphere to get first mRNA vaccine facility,1,"SYDNEY, Australia (AFP) – Covid-19 vaccine maker Moderna announced Monday that it will open an mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in the Australian city of Melbourne, a first for the southern hemisphere.The project will be based at one of Australia’s largest universities, Monash, and will produce 100 million vaccine doses a year for Covid-19, influenza and other diseases.Moderna’s Spikevax was one of a new class of inoculations developed during the coronavirus pandemic that uses a cutting-edge technology called messenger RNA (mRNA).These vaccines can be quickly developed and use a molecule to teach the body to identify and fight a pathogen, such as Covid-19, unlike traditional jabs, which contain a small piece of bacteria or virus.Construction on the mRNA manufacturing facility is set to begin this year and be complete in 2024 — with vaccines production starting soon after.Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday that it was a “show of faith” in Australia by vaccine giant Moderna.For Australia, the facility is not only about health or science, he said, but “also about national security” after the country experienced serious vaccine shortages during the pandemic.Melbourne, where the Moderna facility will be based, faced one of the world’s longest lockdowns as authorities tried to contain the virus.Albanese said a lesson from the pandemic was that “we need to make more things here. We can’t continue to assume that it’s okay to be at the end of global supply chains”.“In this part of the world, in the fastest-growing region in the world in human history, we have an opportunity to project that capacity into the Indo-Pacific as well,” he said.In recent months, Covid-19 cases have spiked in Australia after restrictions were loosened.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/forever-16-americas-teens-succumbing-to-deadly-fentanyl/,Forever 16: America’s teens succumbing to deadly fentanyl,1,"Makayla Cox, a high school student in the US state of Virginia, thought she was taking medication that her friend had procured to treat pain and anxiety.Instead, the pill she took two weeks after her sixteenth birthday was fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 times more potent than heroin. It killed her almost instantly.After watching a movie — a prequel to “Harry Potter” — with her mother Shannon one evening in January, Makayla appeared fine as she headed to her bedroom with her husky dog that often slept on her bed.But when Shannon entered Makayla’s room the next morning, she found her partially sitting up, perched against the headboard, orange fluid coming out of her nose and mouth.“She was stiff. I shook her, I screamed her name, I called 911,” Shannon told AFP. “My neighbors came over and did CPR, but it was too late. After that, I just don’t remember much.”America’s opioid crisis has reached catastrophic proportions, with over 80,000 people dying of opioid overdoses last year, most of them due to illicit synthetics such as fentanyl — more than seven times the number a decade ago.“This is the most dangerous epidemic that we’ve seen,” said Ray Donovan, chief of operations at the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). “Fentanyl is not like any other illicit narcotic, it’s that deadly instantaneously.”And deaths are rising especially quickly among young people, who obtain counterfeit prescription drugs through social media. Unknown to them, the pills come either laced with or made of fentanyl.In 2019, 493 American adolescents died of drug overdose, in 2021 that figure was 1,146. Drug dealers reach adolescents on apps such as Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram and others, often using emojis as code.Oxycodone, an opioid, may be advertised as a half-peeled banana, Xanax, a benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety, as a chocolate bar, and Adderall, an amphetamine that acts as a stimulant, as a train.Wilson Compton, deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said the number of Americans doing drugs has largely stayed the same in recent years, but what changed is how deadly they’ve become.One cup of heroin is equivalent to one teaspoon of fentanyl, and less than one gram can mean the difference between life and death.“It takes very small quantities to be a poison that can stop somebody breathing,” Compton told AFP in an interview.Most of the illicit fentanyl in the United States is manufactured by Mexican drug cartels in clandestine labs from chemicals shipped over from China.Because fentanyl is much more potent, it takes much less of it to fill a pill, resulting in more supply and more profit to the cartels.One kilogram of pure fentanyl can be purchased for up to $12,000, pressed into half a million of pills that will sell for up to $30 each, raking in millions of dollars, Donovan said. And it’s also much easier to smuggle in pill form.Last year, the DEA seized 15,000 pounds (nearly seven tons) of fentanyl — enough to kill every American. Four out of 10 seized pills contain lethal quantities of fentanyl. At the agency’s headquarters, a collection of photographs titled “Faces of Fentanyl” hangs in the hallway. It features dozens of portraits of people who recently lost their lives to fentanyl. One of them reads “Makayla. Forever 16.”An honor-roll student and a cheerleader, Makayla liked to paint, cuddle with her two huskies, Maize and Malenkai, and planned to go to university to study law, said her mother Shannon Doyle, 41, who works as a paralegal in a loan service firm.Makayla had battled anxiety after her parents’ divorce, but things got worse during the pandemic.Last summer she started a job at a water park, where she met a friend who introduced her to counterfeit prescription drugs.The blue pills found in Makayla’s bed turned out to be 100 percent fentanyl. Police are investigating, but so far no arrests have been made.“It used to be that when you were addicted to drugs you had five, 10, 15 years to try and get over your addiction and get the help and change your life,” Shannon said at her house in Virginia Beach, a town on the Atlantic coast some 240 miles (400 kilometers) south of the US capital.“You don’t have that chance anymore.”Last year the DEA launched a campaign called “One pill can kill” to raise awareness of the dangers of fentanyl, and there are efforts across America to make naloxone, a medication that can reverse an opioid overdose, more easily available, including in schools.Makayla’s ashes are in her bedroom and Shannon still peeks into the room every morning and evening, like she did when her daughter was alive.She started a foundation in Makayla’s name to help prevent similar tragedies — a way, she says, helps her cope with her grief.Makayla’s best friend Kaydence Blanchard, 16, is spending the summer without her, trying to make good on the dreams the girls had: to get a driver’s license and drive to the beach.But for Makayla “the future will never happen,” Blanchard said. “She will never complete any of the plans that we had together.” © Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/new-us-strategy-to-make-monkeypox-vaccine-go-further/,New US strategy to make monkeypox vaccine go further,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) – US health authorities on Tuesday authorized a new procedure for injecting the monkeypox vaccine that should make it possible to inoculate more people with the same amount of the drug, at a time when doses are running short in the country.The Food and Drug Administration also authorized giving the vaccine to people under the age of 18 who are considered to be at high risk of infection.For those over 18, health workers will now be able to administer the vaccine differently, via an intradermal injection — that is, between the upper layers of the skin — and not with a deeper, subcutaneous injection.The new method will “increase the total number of doses available for use by up to five-fold,” the FDA said in a statement.Two injections, four weeks apart, will still be necessary.The FDA said it was drawing on data from a 2015 clinical trial that showed a similar immune response in people given a subcutaneous injection compared to those given a fifth of the dose via an intradermal shot.At present, some 620,000 doses of the vaccine — manufactured by Bavarian Nordic, and marketed under the name Jynneos in the United States — have been distributed across the country.Another 440,000 additional doses are still to be distributed, which could allow up to 2.2 million injections under the new strategy.The government has also ordered an additional five million doses, which will start arriving from September and run through 2023, affording the potential to administer 25 million doses.The decisions came after the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for the vaccine, a move that itself followed the declaration of a public health emergency last week.For the authorization in minors, the FDA said it had reviewed safety data for the vaccine, as well as data for another vaccine given in children against smallpox.“We feel very comfortable with the safety of the approach,” said Peter Marks of the FDA at a press conference, noting a recent increase in the number of children who have potentially been exposed to infected people.The United States has registered nearly 9,000 cases of monkeypox, a fifth of them in New York state. The vast majority of cases involve men who have had sex with men.la/vgr/jh/md© Agence France-Presse"

I don’t use an insulin pump, I always have my insulin pen with me and I inject myself that way,” he said.He also revealed he would likely miss the US Open in late August due to his ankle injury, picked up in an epic Roland Garros semi-final in June.Zverev has instead set his heart on a mid-September comeback at the Davis Cup.chc/dmc/iwd© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/study-shows-environmental-impact-of-57000-products-sold-in-supermarkets/,Study shows environmental impact of 57,1,"United States (AFP) – Eating fruits and vegetables is better for the planet than eating meat and cheese, but a new study by scientists released Monday showed chips and sugary drinks also have a very low environmental impact.Scientists analyzed some 57,000 products sold in supermarkets in Britain and Ireland, in a large study published by the scientific journal PNAS.The researchers, who hope that their study may allow consumers to shop more sustainably without sacrificing anything to their health, also compared the results with the nutritional qualities of these foods.They found that juice concentrates, sodas or other fruit juices are among the products sold with the lowest environmental impact — because they are mostly composed of water — but their nutritional quality is poor.Researchers believe that in general, the more sustainable a food is, the better it is from a nutritional point of view.The study confirms what other previous reports had already advanced by analyzing single ingredients, such as fruits or red meat.The novelty of the latest report is that its analysis relates to products made up of multiple ingredients, such as sauces, prepared meals, and others.That task was complicated by the fact that the quantity of each ingredient is considered a trade secret, and therefore no real details are disclosed: Only about three percent of the more than 57,000 products sold by eight food retailers had their composition fully disclosed.Scientists responded by developing an algorithm based on the few known pieces of information to evaluate the missing products — in Britain and Ireland, ingredients are notably listed in order of quantity used.To assess the environmental impact, four factors were considered: greenhouse gas emissions, use of limited water resources, land use, and eutrophication, which is when waterways are enriched with minerals and nutrients, mostly from fertilizers.Bread, but also certain cereals and prepared meals or desserts, have a relatively low or intermediate environmental impact.On the other hand, fish, cheese and meat — especially red meat — have a high impact.“Replacing meat, dairy, and eggs with plant-based alternatives could have large environmental and health benefits,” the study notes.But “smaller” transitions can also help. For example, beef lasagna, with a high environmental impact, could be replaced by chicken or pork lasagna, or vegetarian.In the future, better knowing the proportions and origin of different ingredients would help to determine more precisely their impact on the environment, the researchers said.la/jh/wd© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/health-fears-over-beluga-whale-spotted-in-frances-seine-river/,000 products sold in supermarkets,1,"RENNES, France (AFP) – A beluga whale that swam up France’s Seine river appears to be underweight and officials are worried about its health, regional authorities said Thursday.The protected species, usually found in cold Arctic waters, had made its way up the waterway and reached a lock some 70 kilometres (44 miles) from Paris.The whale was first spotted Tuesday in the river that flows through the French capital to the English Channel, and follows the rare appearance of a killer whale in the Seine just over two months ago.French rescue services as well as firefighters and biodiversity officials mobilised swiftly and kept a close eye on the whale throughout the day to evaluate the “worrying” health of the mammal, the local prefecture said.It added the whale seemed to have “skin changes and to be underweight”.It is “currently between the Poses dam and that of Saint-Pierre-la-Garenne”, around 70 kilometres (43 miles) northwest of Paris.Gerard Mauger, deputy head of French Marine Mammal Research Group GEEC, said the mammal spent “very little time on the surface” and appeared to have “good” lung capacity.But Mauger said rescuers were struggling to guide the whale to the mouth of the Seine.Officials did not specify the size, but an adult beluga can reach up to four metres (13 feet) in length.Authorities in Normandy’s Eure department urged people to keep their distance to avoid distressing the animal.Lamya Essemlali, head of the non-profit marine conservation organisation Sea Shepherd, said some of her team would arrive with drones in the evening to locate the whale more easily.“The environment is not very welcoming for the beluga, the Seine is very polluted and cetaceans are extremely sensitive to noise,” she said, adding that the Seine was “very noisy”.In late May, the killer whale — also known as an orca, but technically part of the dolphin family — was found dead in the Seine between Le Havre and Rouen.The animal had found itself stranded in the river and was unable to make its way back to the ocean despite attempts by officials to guide it.“The urgency is to feed the whale to prevent it from suffering the same fate as the orca who died after starving to death,” Essemlali said.The prefecture said it would assist and monitor Sea Shepherd’s efforts.The Eure authorities said lone belugas do sometimes swim further south than usual, and are able to temporarily survive in fresh water.While they migrate away from the Arctic in the autumn to feed as ice forms, they rarely venture so far south.mcl/js/jh/lcm-raz/© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/long-covid-symptoms-affects-one-in-eight-study-suggests/,Health fears over Beluga whale spotted in France’s Seine river,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — One in eight people who get coronavirus develop at least one symptom of long Covid, one of the most comprehensive studies on the condition to date suggested on Thursday.With more than half a billion coronavirus cases recorded worldwide since the start of the pandemic, there has been rising concern about the lasting symptoms seen in people with long Covid.However almost none of the existing research has compared long Covid sufferers with people who have never been infected, making it possible that some of the health problems were not caused by the virus.A new study published in The Lancet journal asked more than 76,400 adults in the Netherlands to fill out an online questionnaire on 23 common long Covid symptoms.Between March 2020 and August 2021, each participant filled out the questionnaire 24 times.During that period, more than 4,200 of them — 5.5 percent — reported catching Covid.Of those with Covid, over 21 percent had at least one new or severely increased symptom three to five months after becoming infected.However nearly nine percent of a control group which did not have Covid reported a similar increase.This suggested that 12.7 percent of those who had Covid — around one in eight — suffered from long-term symptoms, the study said.The research also recorded symptoms before and after Covid infection, allowing the researchers to further pinpoint exactly what was related to the virus.It found that common long Covid symptoms include chest pain, breathing difficulties, muscle pain, loss of taste and smell, and general fatigue. One of the study’s authors, Aranka Ballering of the Dutch University of Groningen, said long Covid was “an urgent problem with a mounting human toll”.“By looking at symptoms in an uninfected control group and in individuals both before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we were able to account for symptoms which may have been a result of non-infectious disease health aspects of the pandemic, such as stress caused by restrictions and uncertainty,” she said.The authors of the study said its limitations included that it did not cover later variants, such as Delta or Omicron, and did not collect information about some symptoms such as brain fog, which have since been considered a common sign of long Covid.Another study author, Judith Rosmalen, said “future research should include mental health symptoms” such as depression and anxiety, as well as aspects like brain fog, insomnia and a feeling of malaise after even minor exertion.Christopher Brightling and Rachael Evans, experts from Britain’s Leicester University who were not involved in the study, said it was “a major advance” on previous long Covid research because it had an uninfected control group.“Encouragingly, emerging data from other studies” suggests there is a lower rate of long Covid in people who have been vaccinated or infected with the Omicron variant, they said in a linked Lancet comment.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/india-reports-asias-first-possible-monkeypox-death/,Long Covid symptoms affects one in eight,1,"NEW DELHI, India (AFP) — Indian authorities reported Asia’s first possible monkeypox fatality on Monday after the death of a man who recently returned from United Arab Emirates testing positive.Kerala state’s health ministry said tests on the 22-year-old “showed that the man had monkeypox”.Three monkeypox-related fatalities have so far been reported outside Africa in an outbreak that the World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency.The Indian man died in Kerala on July 30 around a week after returning from the UAE and being taken to hospital.It was unclear however whether monkeypox was the cause of death.“The youth had no symptoms of monkeypox. He had been admitted to a hospital with symptoms of encephalitis and fatigue,” the Indian Express daily quoted Kerala’s health minister Veena George as saying on Sunday.Twenty people identified as high risk of infection were being kept under observation, she added, including family members, friends who played football with the man and medical staff. According to the WHO, more than 18,000 monkeypox cases have been detected throughout the world outside Africa since the beginning of May, most of them in Europe.Spain last week recorded two monkeypox-related deaths and Brazil one.It is however unclear if monkeypox actually caused the three fatalities, with Spanish authorities as of Sunday still carrying out autopsies and Brazilian authorities saying its deceased patient had other “serious conditions”.The WHO’s European office said on Saturday that more monkeypox-related deaths can be expected.“With the continued spread of monkeypox in Europe, we will expect to see more deaths,” Catherine Smallwood, Senior Emergency Officer at WHO Europe, said in a statement.The goal needs to be “interrupting transmission quickly in Europe and stopping this outbreak”, she said.Paul Hunter of Britain’s University of East Anglia said while the risk of monkeypox-related death outside Africa “remains low… these reports reinforce the need to roll out vaccination as soon as possible to those people who are most at risk”. India has reported at least four cases, with the first recorded on July 15 in another man who returned to Kerala from the UAE.Kerala’s health ministry said in its statement on Monday that a high-level team from the state medical board would probe the death.Primary tests from the National Institute of Virology in the city of Pune showed that the man had the variant from West Africa and that more genetic tests would be conducted.“The disease is nobody’s fault. Those who have symptoms should inform the health department so that the spread can be contained,” the ministry said, adding that there was “no need to panic”.It added that the man’s family only informed doctors on July 30 result of tests conducted in Dubai on July 19, by which time he was in a critical condition.It added that there were 165 passengers on the same flight from UAE but that “nobody is a close contact”. Monkeypox, so called because it was first discovered in a monkey, is related to the deadly smallpox virus, which was eradicated in 1980, but is far less severe.Early signs of the disease include a high fever, swollen lymph glands and a chickenpox-like rash.In May 2022, a flurry of cases was detected in countries outside Africa in people with no travel links to the region.The WHO last month declared the outbreak to be a global health emergency — the highest alarm it can sound."

Saving them both was a historic accomplishment.”Members of the medical team, which included nearly 100 staff, prepared for the delicate final stages of the surgery on June 7 and 9 with the help of virtual reality.Using brain scans to create a digital map of the boys’ shared cranium, surgeons practiced for the procedure in a trans-Atlantic, virtual-reality trial surgery executed in both Britain and Brazil.British neurosurgeon Noor ul Owase Jeelani, the lead surgeon for Gemini Untwined, called the prep session “space-age stuff.”“It’s just wonderful, it’s really great to see the anatomy and do the surgery before you actually put the children at any risk,” he told British news agency PA.“To do it in virtual reality was just really man-on-Mars stuff.”Pictures and videos released by medical staff showed the boys lying side-by-side post-surgery, little Arthur reaching out to touch his brother’s hand.The boys are still recovering, and may need further procedures as they develop, doctors said. Speech is difficult for them, and Bernardo has a motor deficit on the right-hand side, Mufarrej said.“They will take some time to get to the point where we want them to be. But I believe in them,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/insecurity-inflation-deepen-malnutrition-in-nigerias-northwest/,Peru registers first death in monkeypox patient: hospital,1,"KATSINA, Nigeria (AFP) — Lariya Abdulkareem’s family used to make a living farming beans and sorghum at a village in Nigeria’s northwest Katsina state.But threats of bandit attacks forced them to abandon their land and farm elsewhere.Today, worsening insecurity has disrupted agriculture and food supplies in the region, and the grandmother says feeding her family has become a challenge.“We cannot access the places we did before,” Abdulkareem said, clutching her seven-month-old granddaughter in a clinic set up a year ago by health authorities with Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders, MSF).Rural northwest Nigeria has been ravaged by gangs of bandit militias who raid villages, loot cattle and kidnap people, holding them for ransom in camps deep in the forests that carpet the region.Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced across the northwest and central regions, and thousands killed.The impact rivals that of a 13-year jihadist conflict in the northeast of Nigeria which has claimed more than 40,000 lives.But in the northwest, the gang crime has also combined with surging prices for food and fuel, breeding a crisis that inflicts hunger on youngsters who are already exposed to malaria and other diseases, say aid workers and health officials. MSF, one of the few international agencies to be active in the northwest, said the complex crisis has fuelled a surge in severe acute malnutrition among youngsters.In Katsina state alone, nearly 44,500 children have been admitted to nutrition programs this year, and aid agency and local health authorities are preparing for this to rise to 100,000 by year’s end.Nafisa Sani, a senior Katsina health official, said the state is seeing “high” numbers of malnutrition even for a region that often struggles with children malnourishment.The Kofar Sauri in-patient clinic in Katsina city was set up to treat 200 patients, but admits up to 350, with mothers often sharing beds in tented wards. Other health facilities see a daily flow of hundreds of mothers seeking help.MSF’s in-patient sites in Katsina will expand capacity to 500 beds next month to attend to growing need over recent weeks, but complicated cases rose 40 percent just over the last week.Inside tents, children under five, some on drips in emergency care, are weighed, measured and diagnosed for malnutrition, often after falling sick with other illnesses, medical staff say.“We have measles ongoing, there is a hunger gap and with banditry we have a lot of displaced. It takes a toll on children,” said Dr Yakubu Abubakar, a pediatrician working at one MSF Katsina city clinic.“And this is just one state.”MSF said in Gummi in neighboring Zamfara state, its teams screened more than 36,000 children under five years old in June, following a nutrition alert.More than half the children were malnourished. One in four was severely malnourished and in need of urgent medical care.UNICEF says Nigeria ranks first in the continent and second in the world for child malnutrition. Around eight million children in the northwest are undernourished, the agency said. Fear of attacks or violence from bandit militias based in nearby Rugu forests in Katsina’s western areas near the Niger border has kept many families away from farming the land.Just this year, around 20,000 people were displaced by violence or threats in three areas of Jibiya local government area, a local official and community leaders said.Many crossed the border to stay with families in nearby Niger, others shelter with families in Katsina city or other towns, but some are staying in two camps near the city.“People are fearful of being kidnapped, killed or displaced,” said Nuhu Iliya, a primary health care official in Jibia local government authority.“Parents are struggling to get what they need to eat, so the babies and children suffer.”Northwest Nigeria often faces food insecurity, especially in the lean months before harvest, when stocks run low.But as with other parts of the continent, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has disrupted global wheat supplies and fuel prices have increased leading to rise in food costs.Farmers outside working fields just outside Katsina city said the price of seeds for stables sorghum, millet and groundnut have doubled since the start of the year.Wasila Abdullahi, a 24-year-old mother of three, said price hikes were taking a toll on her meagre income.A measure of maize used to cost 400 naira ($1) but now is 550 naira, she said, as her daughter Khadija played at her feet. The two-year-old suffered malnutrition while recovering from measles.“Sometimes we don’t have enough to feed the family,” Abdullahi said.© Agence France-Presse"

But we still have many hills to climb. It is a journey that will require all of us to stand together.” The INB is aiming to ensure better preparedness and a more equitable response for future pandemics.The next INB meeting will be held in December and deliver a progress report to the 2023 World Health Assembly, the annual meeting of WHO member states.Countries are working to conclude the agreement in May 2024.Hurdles that will have to be cleared by then could include how far countries are prepared to go in terms of commitments on issues like equitable vaccine distribution, knowledge-sharing, financing, oversight structures and powers to investigate outbreaks.A key issue down the line could be whether countries want beefed-up powers for the WHO to investigate the sources of outbreaks. Tedros has said that the lack of data-sharing early in the Covid pandemic had been a hindrance.Loyce Pace, the assistant secretary for global affairs at the US Department of Health and Human Services, was in Geneva for the negotiations.“The United States stands ready to be a part of this, of solving the problem of pandemic preparedness and response. We weren’t quite there when it came to Covid-19 and we want to correct that,” she told reporters.Pace said Washington was open to a mix of binding and non-binding options as part of any wider final outcome.“What we most prefer… is something that will work for the world,” she said, adding: “We don’t want to make empty promises that we collectively then can’t or won’t meet.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/monkeypox-from-beginnings-in-africa-to-global-spread/,Monkeypox: From beginnings in Africa to global spread,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — As monkeypox infections jump around the world, prompting a scramble for vaccines, AFP looks at how the disease has spread since first appearing in Africa in the 1970s.On Thursday, World Health Organization (WHO) experts will meet to decide whether a surge in infections outside Africa since May now constitutes a global health emergency.Monkeypox, so called because it was first discovered in a monkey, is related to the deadly smallpox virus, which was eradicated in 1980, but is far less severe.The strain currently circulating outside Africa is the milder of two known versions. Human monkeypox is first identified in 1970 in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in a nine-year-old boy.It becomes endemic in the tropical rainforests of central and west Africa, where 11 countries report cases.The virus is transmitted through close contact with infected animals, mostly rodents, or humans. In June 2003, the disease surfaces in the United States — the first time it had been detected outside Africa.The illness is believed to have spread after rodents, imported into the US from Ghana, infected prairie dogs.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports 87 cases but no fatalities. 2017 brings a major outbreak in Nigeria, with more than 200 confirmed cases and a fatality rate of around three percent, according to the WHO.Over the next five years, sporadic cases are reported around the world in travellers arriving from Nigeria, notably in Britain, Israel, Singapore and the United States. In May 2022, a flurry of cases is detected in countries outside Africa, in people with no travel links to the region. Most of those affected are gay men.Europe is the epicenter of the new outbreak.By May 20, Britain has recorded 20 cases, mostly among gay men.On the same date, the WHO counts 80 confirmed cases around the world, including in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. On May 23, the United States says it is preparing to administer smallpox vaccines, which are effective against monkeypox, to people who have been in close contact with monkeypox patients.Three days later, the European Union says it is working on centralizing purchases of vaccines, as it did for Covid-19. In early June, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says that more than 1,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox have been reported to WHO from 29 countries where the virus is not usually present.On June 21, Britain announces plans to offer vaccines to gay and bisexual men with multiple sexual partners.WHO experts meet on June 23 to discuss the threat but decide that monkeypox does not constitute a global public health emergency. On July 8, health authorities in France also launches pre-emptive jabs for people considered at risk, including gay men, trans people and sex workers.On July 14, the US CDC reports more than 11,000 confirmed cases in some 60 countries where monkeypox is not usually found. Most of the cases are in Europe, the United States and Canada.The number of infections in New York doubles in under a week to several hundred. People stand in line for vaccines, which are in short supply.On July 20, Tedros announces that almost 14,000 confirmed cases have been reported to the WHO this year, from more than 70 countries, with five deaths, all in Africa.He says six countries reported their first cases in the previous week, while some states have limited access to diagnostics and vaccines, making the outbreak harder to track and to stop.The WHO calls a new expert meeting for July 21 to decide whether to declare a health emergency.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/india-reports-first-case-of-monkeypox/,India reports first case of monkeypox,1,"NEW DELHI, India (AFP) — India has reported its first confirmed case of monkeypox after a 35-year-old man with a history of travel to the Middle East showed symptoms, officials said.The federal government rushed a multi-disciplinary team to the southern state of Kerala in view of the confirmed case of monkeypox there, according to an official statement.The man, who travelled from the United Arab Emirates to Kerala on Tuesday, was in stable condition and isolated at a hospital, the state’s health minister Veena George told reporters Thursday.“He is stable and all his vital signs are normal. We have asked all districts to be on alert,” she said.The patient’s primary contacts have also been isolated while passengers who came in contact with him on his flight have been told to monitor themselves for symptoms.Monkeypox is an infectious disease caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals. Human-to-human transmission is possible but considered rare.A surge in monkeypox infections has been reported since early May outside the West and Central African countries where the disease has long been endemic.So far, confirmed cases in non-endemic areas are generally mild and no deaths have been reported.It is considered much less dangerous and contagious than smallpox, which was eradicated more than 40 years ago.The first symptoms of monkeypox are a fever above 38.5 degrees Celsius, headaches, muscle pain and back pain during the course of five days.Rashes subsequently appear on the face, the palms of hands and soles of feet, followed by lesions, spots and finally scabs.Transmission comes through close and prolonged contact between two people, principally via saliva or the pus of scabs formed during infection.Most monkeypox infections so far have been observed in men who have sex with men, of young age and chiefly in urban areas, according to the WHO.The disease has a fatality rate of between one and 10 percent depending on the variant — there are two — in endemic countries.But medical care significantly reduces the risk. Most people recover on their own and outbreaks usually die out on their own due to low transmissibility of the virus."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-calls-for-urgent-action-in-europe-over-monkeypox/,WHO calls for ‘urgent’ action in Europe over monkeypox,1,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AFP) — The World Health Organization called on Friday for “urgent” action to prevent the spread of monkeypox in Europe, noting that cases had tripled in the region over the past two weeks.“Today, I am intensifying my call for governments and civil society to scale up efforts… to prevent monkeypox from establishing itself across a growing geographical area,” WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Henri Kluge said.“Urgent and coordinated action is imperative if we are to turn a corner in the race to reverse the ongoing spread of this disease.”Since early May, a surge in monkeypox cases has been detected outside West and Central African countries where the viral disease is endemic.Ninety percent of all laboratory-confirmed cases registered worldwide — or 4,500 infections — are in Europe, Kluge said.Thirty-one countries and areas have now reported infections.Kluge said Europe remains at the centre of the expanding outbreak and the risk remains high.The WHO does not think the outbreak currently constitutes a public health emergency of international concern but will review its position shortly, he said.Most monkeypox infections so far have been observed in men who have sex with men, of young age and chiefly in urban areas, according to the WHO.It is investigating cases of possible sexual transmission but maintains the disease is primarily spread through close contact.Monkeypox is related to smallpox, which killed millions around the world every year before it was eradicated in 1980, but has far less severe symptoms.The disease starts with a fever and quickly develops into a rash, with the formation of scabs. It is usually mild and typically clears up spontaneously after two to three weeks.Britain has the highest number of reported cases to date — 1,076 according to the UK authorities — ahead of Germany (838), Spain (736), Portugal (365) and France (350), according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.London’s chief public health doctor Kevin Fenton on Thursday urged anyone with symptoms not to take part in the Pride march in the British capital at the weekend.On Friday, the Danish laboratory Bavarian Nordic, the only laboratory manufacturing a licensed vaccine against monkeypox, announced a new shipment of 2.5 million doses to the United States.US health authorities said Tuesday they were immediately releasing 56,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine — five times the number distributed so far — to areas of high transmission as part of a major escalation of the country’s immunisation strategy.The European Medicines Agency announced on Tuesday that it had begun reviewing a smallpox vaccine to extend its use against monkeypox."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-air-war-being-lost-experts-warn-urging-mass-ventilation/,Covid air war being lost,1,"PARIS France (AFP) — The world is still not using one of its most effective weapons against Covid — properly ventilating public spaces — more than two years into the pandemic, experts warn.At the moment there is a “fragile, armed peace” with Covid-19, said Antoine Flahault, director of the Institute of Global Health at the University of Geneva.“In the hopes of stemming the tide of the pandemic and reducing mortality, we need to reduce the level of contamination, which the vaccine cannot do alone,” he told AFP.“We need a new phase — improving the quality of indoor air.”Covid-19 is primarily transmitted through the air. It is carried in large droplets or fine aerosols when an infected person breathes — and even more so when they talk, sing or shout.In a closed off or poorly ventilated room, these aerosols can remain in the air for some time, moving around the space and greatly increasing the risk of infection.While it is generally accepted that Covid can be transmitted within two metres (6.5 feet) via both droplets and aerosols, there is still no consensus on the importance of long-distance airborne transmission indoors.A team of researchers from the UK Health Security Agency and the University of Bristol reviewed 18 studies in several countries on airborne transmission.In research published in the BMJ this week, they found that people can infect each other when they are more than two metres apart. We know one thing for sure: if you open a window, or well-ventilate a space, the virus-carrying aerosols dissipate like smoke.But experts say that nowhere near enough is being done to ventilate public and private spaces across the world.“On the whole, this is an issue that governments have not yet taken up,” Flahault said.He called for massively increased funding to ventilate many public spaces, starting with schools, hospitals, public transport, offices, bars and restaurants.“Just as we knew to filter and treat drinking water” in homes at the beginning of the 1900s, “one can imagine some households will equip themselves with air purifiers and consider opening their windows,” Flahault said.Only a few countries have announced ventilation plans since the start of the pandemic.In March the US government called on all building owners and operators, as well as schools and universities, to “adopt key strategies to improve indoor air quality”.The plan, dubbed the Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, is covered by previously announced Covid funding and also includes a review of existing ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems.The European Union has not issued any binding statements on improving air quality in light of Covid.However Belgium has announced a plan to have a carbon dioxide meter situated in all places open to the public. Having such a meter is voluntary until the end of 2024, when it becomes mandatory.Stephen Griffin of the School of Medicine at Britain’s University of Leeds lamented that the UK had not acted more on ventilation.“Sadly, the UK has not embraced the opportunity to safeguard its citizens in public spaces, its children in schools, or the longevity of the vaccination programme in this way,” he told the Science Media Centre.He said that setting minimum safety standards for ventilation in public buildings would also “greatly mitigate the impact of other diseases”.“Better ventilation also improves cognition by reducing carbon dioxide levels and, along with filtration, can reduce the impact of pollen and other allergies.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pollution-linked-to-10-of-cancer-cases-in-europe-report/,experts warn,1,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AFP) — Pollution is linked to more than 10 percent of cancer cases in Europe, a report by the European Environment Agency said Tuesday.Most of these cases are preventable, it said.“Exposure to air pollution, carcinogenic chemicals, radon, UV (ultraviolet) radiation and second-hand smoke together may contribute over 10 percent of the cancer burden in Europe,” the agency said in a statement.But EEA expert Gerardo Sanchez said “all environmental and occupational cancer risks can be reduced”.“Environmentally determined cancers due to radiation or chemical carcinogens can be reduced to an almost negligible level,” he told journalists last week before the release of the report, the agency’s first on the link between cancer and the environment.In the European Union, 2.7 million people are diagnosed with cancer each year and 1.3 million die from it.The continent, which accounts for less than 10 percent of the world’s population, reports almost a quarter of new cases and a fifth of deaths.Air pollution is linked to around one percent of all cancer cases in Europe, and causes around two percent of all cancer deaths, the agency said.Indoor exposure to radon is linked to up to two percent of all cancer cases, and one in ten lung cancer cases in Europe.Natural UV radiation may be responsible for up to four percent of all cancer cases in Europe, the agency said.Exposure to second-hand smoke may increase the overall risk for all cancers by up to 16 percent for people who have never been smokers, it added.The agency warned that some chemicals used in European workplaces contribute to causing cancer, including lead, arsenic, chromium, cadmium, acrylamide, and pesticides.Asbestos, a well-known carcinogen, is estimated to account for 55 to 88 percent of occupational lung cancers. The EU banned asbestos in 2005, but it is still present in some buildings and workers involved in renovation and demolition work are still exposed, the agency said.“Environmental and occupational cancer risks can be reduced by cleaning up pollution and changing behaviors,” it added.“Decreasing these risks will lead to a fall in the numbers of cancer cases and deaths.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-emergency-committee-decides-on-monkeypox-outbreak-over-3200-confirmed-cases-reported-worldwide/,urging mass ventilation,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — A World Health Organization committee of experts met Thursday to decide whether the monkeypox outbreak constitutes a global health emergency.The outcome of the in-private meeting will be issued on Friday at the earliest, the WHO said.A surge of monkeypox cases has been detected since May outside of the West and Central African countries where the disease has long been endemic. Most of the new cases have been in Western Europe.More than 3,200 confirmed cases and one death have now been reported to the WHO from 48 countries in total this year, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the start of the meeting.Tedros announced on June 14 that he would convene an emergency committee to assess whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) — the highest alarm that the UN health agency can sound.Besides providing a PHEIC assessment, the committee members were set to give the WHO and its member states advice on how to better prevent the spread of the disease and manage their response. Tedros told Thursday’s meeting that all countries needed to strengthen their capacities to prevent onward transmission of monkeypox, using surveillance, contact-tracing and isolating infected patients.“The outbreak in newly-affected countries continues to be primarily among men who have sex with men, and who have reported recent sex with new or multiple partners,” he said, via video-link from the Commonwealth summit in the Rwandan capital Kigali.“Person-to-person transmission is ongoing and is likely underestimated.”He said that in addition to the 3,200-plus confirmed cases, almost 1,500 suspected cases of monkeypox and around 70 suspected deaths have been reported in central Africa this year.The emergency committee will provide Tedros with a PHEIC recommendation, and an assessment of the risk to human health, the risk of international spread and the risk of interference with international traffic.Tedros will then make the final determination on whether a PHEIC should be declared, based on their advice.There have been six PHEIC declarations since 2009, the last being for Covid-19 in 2020 — though the sluggish global response to the alarm bell still rankles at the WHO’s Geneva headquarters.A PHEIC was declared after a third emergency committee meeting on January 30. But it was only after March 11, when Tedros described the rapidly-worsening situation as a pandemic, that many countries seemed to wake up to the danger. On the number of cases, “it is a little difficult to see how much of this is the tip of the iceberg,” said Philippe Duneton, head of the Unitaid agency, which invests in ways to prevent, diagnose and treat diseases.“There are no easy-to-use tests to detect it. This is essentially done at the clinical level. So an important issue is to have testing which is done earlier and which makes it possible to detect cases, particularly among case contacts,” he told AFP.The normal initial symptoms of monkeypox include a high fever, swollen lymph nodes and a blistery chickenpox-like rash.The WHO’s 16-member emergency committee on monkeypox is chaired by Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele from the Democratic Republic of Congo, who is a former director of the WHO’s Vaccines and Immunisation Department.It is co-chaired by Nicola Low, an associate professor of epidemiology and public health medicine from Bern University.The other 14 members are from institutions in Brazil, Britain, Japan, Morocco, Nigeria, Russia, Senegal, Switzerland, Thailand and the United States.Eight advisers from Canada, the DR Congo, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States also took part in Thursday’s hybrid meeting. © Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-vaccines-saved-20-million-lives-in-first-year-study/,Pollution linked to 10% of cancer cases in Europe: report,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Covid vaccines prevented nearly 20 million deaths in the first year after they were introduced, according to the first large modelling study on the topic released Friday.The study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, is based on data from 185 countries and territories collected from December 8, 2020 to December 8, 2021.It is the first attempt to estimate the number of deaths prevented directly and indirectly as a result of Covid-19 vaccinations.It found that 19.8 million deaths were prevented out of a potential 31.4 million deaths that would have occurred if no vaccines were available.It was a 63 percent reduction, the study found.The study used official figures — or estimates when official data was not available — for deaths from Covid, as well as total excess deaths from each country.Excess mortality is the difference between the total number of people who died from all causes and the number of deaths expected based on past data.These analyses were compared with a hypothetical alternative scenario in which no vaccine was administered.The model accounted for variation in vaccination rates across countries, as well as differences in vaccine effectiveness based on the types of vaccines known to have been primarily used in each country.China was not included in the study because of its large population and strict containment measures, which would have skewed the results, it said.The study found that high- and middle-income countries accounted for the largest number of deaths averted, 12.2 million out of 19.8 million, reflecting inequalities in access to vaccines worldwide.Nearly 600,000 additional deaths could have been prevented if the World Health Organization’s (WHO) goal of vaccinating 40 percent of each country’s population by the end of 2021 had been met, it concluded.“Millions of lives have probably been saved by making vaccines available to people around the world,” said lead study author Oliver Watson of Imperial College London.“We could have done more,” he said.Covid has officially killed more than 6.3 million people globally, according to the WHO.But the organization said last month the real number could be as high as 15 million, when all direct and indirect causes are accounted for.The figures are extremely sensitive due to how they reflect on the handling of the crisis by authorities around the world.The virus is on the rise again in some places, including in Europe, which is seeing a warm-weather resurgence blamed in part on Omicron subvariants.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/global-food-crisis-will-kill-millions-by-disease-health-executive-warns/,WHO emergency committee decides on monkeypox outbreak:  Over 3,1,"YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AFP) — The global food crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine will kill millions by leaving the hungriest more vulnerable to infectious diseases, potentially triggering the world’s next health catastrophe, the head of a major aid organization has warned.A Russian naval blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports has stopped grain shipments from the world’s fourth-largest exporter of wheat and corn, raising the specter of shortages and hunger in low-income countries.The knock-on effects of the food shortages mean many will die not only of starvation but from having weaker defenses against infectious diseases due to bad nutrition, Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria told AFP this week.“I think we’ve probably already begun our next health crisis. It’s not a new pathogen but it means people who are poorly nourished will be more vulnerable to the existing diseases,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of a G20 health minister meeting in the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta.“I think the combined impact of infectious diseases and the food shortages and the energy crisis… we can be talking about millions of extra deaths because of this,” he said.World governments should minimize the impact of the food crisis by providing frontline healthcare to their poorest communities, who will be the most vulnerable, said the British former banker who now heads the $4 billion fund.“That means focusing on primary healthcare so the healthcare that is delivered in the villages, in the communities. Hospitals are important but when you are faced with this kind of challenge, the most important thing is primary healthcare.” The battle to contain the spread of coronavirus has taken resources away from the fight against tuberculosis, which killed 1.5 million people in 2020, according to World Health Organization data.“It’s been a disaster for TB,” said Sands.“In 2020 you saw globally 1.5 million people less getting treated for TB and tragically that means several hundreds of thousands of people will die but also that those people will infect other people.”The health expert said solving the food crisis was now paramount in aiding the treatment of the world’s second-deadliest infectious disease.The West and Ukraine accuse Russia of trying to pressure them into concessions by blockading vital grain exports to increase fears of global famine.Moscow has countered by saying that it is Western sanctions that are to blame for shortfalls in the Middle East and Africa.Germany will host a meeting on the crisis on Friday under the title “Uniting for Global Food Security”, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken among those attending.“It is the poor person pandemic and because of that, it hasn’t attracted the same amount of investment in research and development,” Sands said, referring to tuberculosis.“This is a tragedy because this is a disease we know how to prevent, how to cure, we know how to get rid of.”© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/singapore-south-korea-report-first-monkeypox-cases/,Covid vaccines saved 20 million lives in first year: study,1,"(Eagle News) — Both Singapore and South Korea reported their first suspected monkeypox cases, the first such reported cases in Southeast and East Asia respectivelyIn Singapore, the Ministry of Health has confirmed one imported case of monkeypox infection, a 42-year-old male British national who works as a flight attendant. He was in Singapore between June 15 and 17, and then again June 19 since he flew in and out of Singapore.He tested positive for monkeypox on June 20.This is the first confirmed monkeypox case in Southeast Asia, in terms of the recent outbreak of monkeypox worldwide.The patient is “currently warded in at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), and his condition is stable.” Contact tracing is ongoing.According to the Ministry of Health, the case had onset of headache on June 14, and fever on June 16. “These symptoms subsequently resolved” but then he developed skin rashes on June 19. That same night he sought medical attention via teleconsultation and was brought to the NCID for “further assessment.”“Contact tracing is ongoing for the affected flights and for the duration of his stay in Singapore,” said Singapore’s health ministry which reported 13 close contacts of the case that have been identified.These close contacts will also be placed on quarantine for 21 days since their last contact with the case.The health ministry said that the male flight attendant had largely remained in his hotel room during his stay in Singapore, except for a visit to a massage establishment on June 16. He also ate at three food establishments that day.“In general, the risk of transmission to visitors at these locations is low as data has shown that monkeypox transmits through close physical or prolonged contact. All four locations visited by the case are undergoing cleaning and disinfection,” it said.Meanwhile, South Korea reported its first two suspected cases of the monkeypox virus.“Diagnostic tests and epidemiological investigations on the monkeypox are being conducted and the health authority will swiftly hold a briefing to announce measures and response plans once the results are out,” the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said in a statement.The first suspected case is a foreigner whose nationality was not revealed. He had reportedly showed symptoms since Sunday such as sore throat and skin lesions. He arrived in South Korea on Monday and is now being treated at an isolation bed in a hospital in Busan.The other case is a Korean citizen who arrived from Germany on Tuesday afternoon. His symptoms reportedly included mild fever, sore throat, fatigue and skin lesions since Saturday. He reported to health authorities in South Korea and was admitted to the Incheon Medical Center.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “since early May 2022, cases of monkeypox have been reported from countries where the disease is not endemic, and continue to be reported in several endemic countries.”“Most confirmed cases with travel history reported travel to countries in Europe and North America, rather than West or Central Africa where the monkeypox virus is endemic. This is the first time that many monkeypox cases and clusters have been reported concurrently in non-endemic and endemic countries in widely disparate geographical areas,” WHO said.“Most reported cases so far have been identified through sexual health or other health services in primary or secondary health-care facilities and have involved mainly, but not exclusively, men who have sex with men,” it saidMonkeypox is usually a self-limited disease with the symptoms lasting from 2 to 4 weeks, but severe cases can occur. In recent times, the case fatality ratio has been around 3 percent to 6 percent.It can be transmitted to humans “through close contact with an infected person or animal, or with material contaminated with the virus” such as body fluids and respiratory droplets” and lesions.Monkeypox is caused by monkeypox virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus in the family Poxviridae.An antiviral agent developed for the treatment of smallpox has also been licensed for the treatment of monkeypox."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-approves-covid-vaccines-for-youngest-kids/,US approves Covid vaccines for youngest kids,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — US health authorities on Saturday cleared the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines for children aged five and younger, in a move President Joe Biden greeted as a “monumental step” in the fight against the virus.The United States thus became the first country to approve use of the so-called mRNA vaccines for children as young as six months.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had on Friday authorized their emergency use for young children — who previously had to be at least five to receive the vaccine.But the vaccines required further clearance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the country’s leading public health agency — and they received that on Saturday.“We know millions of parents and caregivers are eager to get their young children vaccinated, and with today’s decision, they can,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement Saturday.Once the green light was received from the FDA, the US government began distributing millions of doses of the vaccine across the country.Biden promised that parents could begin scheduling appointments as early as next week to have their young children vaccinated at hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and doctor’s offices.In a statement Saturday, he touted the vaccines as “safe (and) highly effective,” and said that “for parents all over the country, this is a day of relief and celebration.”In coming weeks, with more and more doses shipped out, “every parent who wants a vaccine will be able to get one,” he said.The Moderna vaccine, administered in two doses a month apart, will be available to children aged six months to five years in reduced doses of 25 micrograms (half the amount given children aged six to 11, and a quarter the dose for those 12 and older).The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is now authorized for children aged six months to four years, and will be given in doses of three micrograms per injection — one-tenth the adult dosage.The difference, however, is that children will receive three shots — the first two three weeks apart, followed by a third eight weeks later.So, children receiving it will not have full protection for the first few months.Its side effects, however, have appeared less serious in drug trials than those of the Moderna vaccine.About a quarter of young children receiving Moderna have developed fevers, particularly after the second dose — but they generally lasted no more than a day.About 20 million US children are now eligible, by age, for the new vaccines.While children have generally proved less vulnerable to Covid-19, some 480 in the US in this age group have died of the virus.So-called long Covid is also a concern, as is multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a rare but serious post-viral condition.Pfizer has said it hopes to apply in early July to the European Medicines Agency for authorization to provide its vaccines to children in this youngest age group."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-approves-pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-for-youngest-children/,US approves Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for youngest children,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The US Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorization Friday for the use of Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines in the youngest children, the final age group awaiting immunization in most countries.The agency, whose approval is considered the global gold standard, authorized Moderna’s two-dose vaccine for children aged six months to five years, and three doses of Pfizer’s shots for those between six months and four years old.“Many parents, caregivers and clinicians have been waiting for a vaccine for younger children and this action will help protect those down to six months of age,” FDA chief Robert Califf said in a statement.“We expect that the vaccines for younger children will provide protection from the most severe outcomes of Covid-19, such as hospitalization and death.”Pfizer said it plans to submit requests for authorization to other regulators around the world, including the European Medicines Agency in early July.“Parents in the US now have the option to vaccinate their children under 5 years of age, and we are working to ensure that other countries worldwide will follow,” said Ugur Sahin, CEO and co-founder of Germany’s BioNTech, which developed the vaccine together with Pfizer.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must now also recommend the vaccines before they are put into use in the United States — a final green light that will be given after a meeting of an advisory committee of experts that is expected to be held shortly.But the government has said that as soon as the FDA decision was made, 10 million doses could immediately be sent around the country, followed by millions more in subsequent weeks. Both vaccines are based on messenger RNA, which delivers genetic code for the coronavirus spike protein to human cells that then grow it on their surface, training the immune system to be ready. The technology is now considered the leading Covid vaccination platform.The vaccines were tested in trials of thousands of children. They were found to cause similar levels of mild side effects as in older age groups and triggered similar levels of antibodies.Efficacy against infection was higher for Pfizer, with the company placing it at 80 percent, compared to Moderna’s estimates of 51 percent for children aged six-months to two years old and 37 percent for those aged two to five years.But the Pfizer figure is based on very few cases and is thus considered preliminary. It also takes three doses to achieve its protection, with the third shot given eight weeks after the second, which is given three weeks after the first.Moderna’s vaccine should provide strong protection against severe disease after two doses, given four weeks apart, and the company is studying adding a booster that would raise efficacy levels against mild disease.However, Moderna’s decision to go with a higher dose is associated with higher levels of fevers in reaction to the vaccine compared to Pfizer.“We are thrilled that the FDA has granted Emergency Use Authorization of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine for children and adolescents, particularly for our vulnerable, youngest children,” said Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel.“Children need to live highly social lives to develop and flourish,” Bancel added. “With this authorization, caregivers for young children ages 6 months through 5 years of age finally have a way to safeguard against Covid risks in classroom and daycare settings.”The United States, home to 20 million children four years and under, has recorded 480 Covid deaths in that group in the pandemic — far higher than even a bad flu season, according to the FDA.As of May 2022, there have been 45,000 hospitalizations in that group, nearly a quarter of which required intensive care."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/hunger-crisis-could-swell-already-record-global-displacement-un/,Hunger crisis could swell already record global displacement: UN,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — Russia’s war in Ukraine has pushed global displacement numbers above 100 million for the first time, and the UN warns the resulting hunger crisis could force many more to flee their homes.Efforts to address the global food insecurity crisis, which has been dramatically aggravated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, is “of paramount importance… to prevent a larger number of people moving,” the United Nations refugee chief Filippo Grandi told reporters.“If you ask me how many… I don’t know, but it will be pretty big numbers.”Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, traditionally a breadbasket to the world, has sparked dramatic grain and fertilizer shortages, sent global prices soaring and put hundreds of millions of people at risk from hunger.“The impact, if this is not resolved quickly, would be devastating,” Grandi said. “It is already devastating.”His comments came as he presented the UNHCR refugee agency’s annual report on global displacement, showing that a record 89.3 million people were displaced at the end of 2021 — more than doubling in a decade.But since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on February 24, as many as 14 million Ukrainians may have fled within their own war-ravaged country or across borders as refugees, pushing global displacement past the grim 100-million mark for the first time. “Every year of the last decade, the numbers have climbed,” Grandi said.“Either the international community comes together to take action to address this human tragedy, resolve conflicts and find lasting solutions, or this terrible trend will continue.”The UN agency found that at the end of 2021, a record 27.1 million people were living as refugees, while the number of asylum seekers rose 11 percent to 4.6 million.And for the 15th straight year, the number of people living displaced within their own country due to conflict swelled, hitting 53.2 million.The UNHCR report said last year was notable for the number of protracted conflicts in places like Afghanistan that escalated, even as new ones flared.At the same time, growing food scarcity, inflation and the climate crisis were adding to hardship and stretching the humanitarian response, threatening to weaken already dire funding levels for many crises, UNHCR warned.That has not been the case for Ukraine, with an enormous outpouring of solidarity, and fleeing Ukrainians welcomed with open arms across Europe. Grandi hailed the generous response to this crisis, but highlighted the contrast to how refugees fleeing wars in places like Syria and Afghanistan have been met.The UN refugee chief recalled how European leaders had insisted “it’s full” when asked to take in more refugees from those conflicts.“I’m not naive. I fully understand the context,” he said, adding though that the generous response to fleeing Ukrainians “proves an important point… The arrival of desperate people on the shores or at the borders of rich countries is not unmanageable.”Grandi also pointed to how massive sums of money had been made immediately available to respond to the Ukraine crisis, despite countries’ insistence their coffers were empty when met with appeals for more aid for other situations.“There cannot be inequity in the response,” he said.Countries have vowed the aid provided for Ukraine would come on top of amounts pledged for other crises, but Grandi cautioned that so far “the mathematics doesn’t show that.” It would be disastrous if already underfunded responses were cut further, he warned.He voiced particular concern for the Horn of Africa and the Sahel, where massive displacement is being driven by a macabre combination of conflict, insecurity, poor governance and devastating effects of climate change.“It’s a very vicious circle of many factors,” he said.Grandi warned that beyond the immediate impact, the war in Ukraine was also complicating the response to displacement crises since it had “dealt a terrible blow to international cooperation.”Even if the war were to end within months — which he thought unlikely — “the scars on international cooperation of those fractures between the West and Russia… will take a long time to heal.”And, he warned, “if that is not healed, I don’t know how we will deal with this global crisis.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/over-14-of-world-has-had-lyme-disease-study/,Over 14% of world has had Lyme disease: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — More than 14 percent of the world’s population has had Lyme disease, the most common tick-borne illness, according to a major review of the available research published on Tuesday.Central Europe had the highest rate of infection with 20 percent, while men over the age of 50 living in rural areas were most at risk, the study in the journal BMJ Global Health found.The condition is rarely fatal, but people bitten by an infected tick often get a rash and suffer flu-like symptoms including muscle and joint ache, headache, nausea and vomiting.To find out how common Lyme disease is across the world, the researchers pooled data from 89 studies.The bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), which causes the disease, was found in the blood of 14.5 percent of the nearly 160,000 total participants.“This is the most comprehensive and up-to-date systematic review of the worldwide” prevalence of the disease, the researchers said.After Central Europe, the regions with the highest antibody rates were Eastern Asia with 15.9 percent, Western Europe with 13.5 percent and Eastern Europe with 10.4 percent.The Caribbean meanwhile had the lowest rate, with just two percent.Previous research has shown that the prevalence of tick-borne diseases has doubled in the last 12 years.Reasons for the rise included longer, drier summers due to climate change, animal migration, habitat loss and “increasingly frequent pet contact”, the study said.Farmers and workers who regularly interact with host animals like dogs and sheep were most at risk of getting bitten by an infected tick, the study found.It warned that the data could be skewed in regions where Lyme disease is endemic, because health workers are more likely to carry out regular antibody tests there compared to regions where it is less common.The study also said that research using an analytic technique called western blotting was more reliable and that its use “could significantly improve the accuracy” of future studies.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/the-age-of-outbreaks-experts-warn-of-more-animal-disease-threats/,The age of outbreaks: Experts warn of more animal disease threats,1,"With the spread of monkeypox across the world coming hot on the heels of Covid-19, there are fears that increasing outbreaks of diseases that jump from animals to humans could spark another pandemic.While such diseases — called zoonoses — have been around for millennia, they have become more common in recent decades due to deforestation, mass livestock cultivation, climate change and other human-induced upheavals of the animal world, experts say.Other diseases to leap from animals to humans include HIV, Ebola, Zika, SARS, MERS, bird flu and the bubonic plague.The World Health Organization said on Thursday that it is still investigating the origins of Covid, but the “strongest evidence is still around zoonotic transmission”.And with more than 1,000 monkeypox cases recorded globally over the last month, the UN agency has warned there is a “real” risk the disease could become established in dozens of countries.The WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan said last week that “it’s not just in monkeypox” — the way that humans and animals interact has become “unstable”.“The number of times that these diseases cross into humans is increasing and then our ability to amplify that disease and move it on within our communities is increasing,” he said.Monkeypox did not recently leap over to humans — the first human case was identified in DR Congo in 1970 and it has since been confined to areas in Central and Western Africa.Despite its name, “the latest monkeypox outbreak has nothing to do with monkeys,” said Olivier Restif, epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge.While it was first discovered in macaques, “zoonotic transmission is most often from rodents, and outbreaks spread by person-to-person contact,” he told AFP. Around 60 percent of all known human infections are zoonotic, as are 75 percent of all new and emerging infectious diseases, according to the UN Environment Programme.Restif said the number of zoonotic pathogens and outbreaks have increased in the past few decades due to “population growth, livestock growth and encroachment into wildlife habitats”.“Wild animals have drastically changed their behaviours in response to human activities, migrating from their depleted habitats,” he said.“Animals with weakened immune systems hanging around near people and domestic animals is a sure way of getting more pathogen transmission.”Benjamin Roche, a specialist in zoonoses at France’s Institute of Research for Development, said that deforestation has had a major effect.“Deforestation reduces biodiversity: we lose animals that naturally regulate viruses, which allows them to spread more easily,” he told AFP.And worse may be to come, with a major study published earlier this year warning that climate change is ramping the risk of another pandemic.As animals flee their warming natural habitats they will meet other species for the first time — potentially infecting them with some of the 10,000 zoonotic viruses believed to be “circulating silently” among wild mammals, mostly in tropical forests, the study said.Greg Albery, a disease ecologist at Georgetown University who co-authored the study, told AFP that “the host-pathogen network is about to change substantially”. “We need improved surveillance both in urban and wild animals so that we can identify when a pathogen has jumped from one species to another — and if the receiving host is urban or in close proximity to humans, we should get particularly concerned,” he said.Eric Fevre, a specialist in infectious diseases at Britain’s University of Liverpool and the International Livestock Research Institute in Kenya, said that “a whole range of new, potentially dangerous diseases could emerge — we have to be ready”.This includes “focusing the public health of populations” in remote environments and “better studying the ecology of these natural areas to understand how different species interact”.Restif said that there is “no silver bullet — our best bet is to act at all levels to reduce the risk”.“We need huge investment in frontline healthcare provision and testing capacity for deprived communities around the world, so that outbreaks can be detected, identified and controlled without delays,” he said.On Thursday, a WHO scientific advisory group released a preliminary report outlining what needs to be done when a new zoonotic pathogen emerges.It lists a range of early investigations into how and where the pathogen jumped to humans, determining the potential risk, as well as longer-term environmental impacts."

It is related to but less severe than smallpox, causing a rash that spreads, fever, chills, and aches, among other symptoms.The World Health Organization (WHO) has already registered nearly 1,000 cases of the illness in 29 countries where it is not endemic. Most of them have been detected in Britain, Canada, Germany, Portugal and Spain.The first Brazilian person infected had traveled to both Spain and Portugal, the health ministry said in a statement. He was hospitalized for treatment and was in “good condition,” it said, adding that his close contacts were under observation.Brazil is the third Latin American country to register monkeypox cases after Argentina and Mexico.So far, the WHO says no deaths have been reported in countries where monkeypox is not endemic.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/monkeypox-outbreak-tops-1000-cases-who-warns-of-real-risk/,Monkeypox outbreak tops 1,1,"The risk of monkeypox becoming established in non-endemic nations is real, the WHO warned Wednesday, with more than a thousand cases now confirmed in such countries.World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN health agency was not recommending mass vaccination against the virus, and added that no deaths had been reported so far from the outbreaks.“The risk of monkeypox becoming established in non-endemic countries is real,” Tedros told a press conference.The zoonotic disease is endemic in humans in nine African countries but outbreaks have been reported in the past month in several other states — mostly in Europe, and notably in Britain, Spain and Portugal.“More than 1,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox have now been reported to WHO from 29 countries that are not endemic for the disease,” Tedros said.“So far, no deaths have been reported in these countries. Cases have been reported mainly, but not only, among men who have sex with men.“Some countries are now beginning to report cases of apparent community transmission, including some cases in women.”The initial symptoms include a high fever, swollen lymph nodes and a blistery chickenpox-like rash.Tedros said he was particularly concerned about the risk the virus poses to vulnerable groups, including pregnant women and children.He said the sudden and unexpected appearance of monkeypox outside endemic countries suggested that there might have been undetected transmission for some time, but it was not known for how long.One case of monkeypox in a non-endemic country is considered an outbreak.Tedros said that while this was “clearly concerning”, the virus had been circulating and killing in Africa for decades, with more than 1,400 suspected cases and 66 deaths so far this year.“The communities that live with the threat of this virus every day deserve the same concern, the same care and the same access to tools to protect themselves,” he said. In the few places where vaccines are available, they are being used to protect those who may be exposed, such as healthcare workers.He added that post-exposure vaccination, ideally within four days, could be considered for higher-risk close contacts, such as sexual partners or household members.Tedros said the WHO would issue guidance in the coming days on clinical care, infection prevention and control, vaccination and community protection.He said people with symptoms should isolate at home and consult a health worker, while people in the same household should avoid close contact.Few hospitalisations have been reported, apart from patients being isolated, the WHO said at the weekend.Sylvie Briand, the WHO’s epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention director, said the smallpox vaccine could be used against monkeypox, a fellow orthopoxvirus, with a high degree of efficacy.The WHO is trying to determine how many doses are currently available and to find out from manufacturers what their production and distribution capacities are.rjm/nl/kjm© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/more-than-700-monkeypox-cases-globally-21-in-us-cdc/,WHO warns of ‘real’ risk,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Friday it was aware of more than 700 global cases of monkeypox, including 21 in the United States, with investigations now suggesting it is spreading inside the country.Sixteen of the first 17 cases were among people who identify as men who have sex with men, according to a new CDC report, and 14 were thought to be travel associated.All patients are in recovery or have recovered, and no cases have been fatal.“There have also been some cases in the United States that we know are linked to known cases,” Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the CDC’s Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, told reporters on a call.“We also have at least one case in the United States that does not have a travel link or know how they acquired their infection.”Monkeypox is a rare disease that is related to but less severe than smallpox, causing a rash that spreads, fever, chills, and aches, among other symptoms.Generally confined to western and central Africa, cases have been reported in Europe since May and the number of countries affected has grown since.Canada also released new figures Friday, counting 77 confirmed cases — almost all of them detected in Quebec province, where vaccines have been delivered.Though its new spread may be linked to particular gay festivals in Europe, monkeypox is not thought to be a sexually transmitted disease, with the main risk factor being close skin-to-skin contact with someone who has monkey pox sores.A person is contagious until all the sores have scabbed and new skin is formed. Raj Panjabi, senior director for the White House’s global health security and biodefense division, added that 1,200 vaccines and 100 treatment courses had been delivered to US states, where they were offered to close contacts of those infected.There are currently two authorized vaccines: ACAM2000 and JYNNEOS, which were originally developed against smallpox.Though smallpox has been eliminated, the United States retains the vaccines in a strategic national reserve in case it is deployed as a biological weapon.JYNNEOS is the more modern of the two vaccines, with fewer side effects.“We continue to have more than enough vaccine available,” Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response in the Department of Health and Human Services, told reporters.In late May, the CDC said it had 100 million doses of ACAM200 and 1,000 doses of JYNNEOS available, but O’Connell said Friday the figures had shifted, though she could not divulge precise numbers for strategic reasons.The CDC has also authorized two antivirals used to treat smallpox, TPOXX and Cidofovir, to be repurposed to treat monkeypox.“Anyone can get monkeypox and we are carefully monitoring for monkeypox that may be spreading in any population, including those who are not identifying as men who have sex with men,” said McQuiston.That being said, the CDC is undertaking special outreach in the LGBT community, she added.A suspected case “should be anyone with a new characteristic rash,” or anyone who meets the criteria for high suspicion such as relevant travel, close contact, or being a man who has sex with men."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/estimated-2-million-have-long-covid-in-uk-official-data/,WHO: 780 monkeypox outbreak cases,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — An estimated two million people in the UK, which represents around three percent of the population, have reported experiencing so-called long Covid, official statistics showed Wednesday.Around 1.4 million of them said they first had Covid-19, or suspected they had the virus, at least 12 weeks previously, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).It also found 826,000 of them first had coronavirus at least a year earlier, while 376,000 said they first had it at least two years previously.The ONS figures are based on people’s own reports of suffering from long Covid from a representative sample of private households in the four weeks to May 1.Fatigue is the most common symptom — experienced by 55 percent of those with self-reported long Covid — followed by shortness of breath (32 percent), a cough (23 percent) and muscle ache (23 percent).The biggest proportion were people aged 35 to 69, females, those living in more deprived areas and those working in certain professions such as social care, teaching and education or health care, the ONS said.Those with another activity-limiting health condition or disability were also more prevalent among the long Covid sufferers, it added.The UK, which was one of the worst-impacted countries by the pandemic, has eased all restrictions this year as cases and hospital admissions have fallen amid relatively high vaccination rates.The country of around 67 million people has recorded nearly 18.8 million cases, and almost 178,000 deaths from the virus, since it hit more than two years ago.The ONS assessment found nearly a third of the two million people reporting long-lasting symptoms first had Covid, or suspected they had it, during the Omicron wave which began late last year.Its numbers follow another UK study published in April showing that only around a quarter of people have completely recovered from Covid a full year after being hospitalised with the disease.The research, by the National Institute for Health and Care Research involving more than 2,300 people, also found that women were 33 percent less likely to fully recover than men."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/monkeypox-cases-could-be-peak-of-iceberg-who/,More than 700 monkeypox cases globally,1,"GENEVA, Switzzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization cautioned Friday that some 200 monkeypox cases found in recent weeks outside of countries where the virus usually circulates could be just the beginning.“We don’t know if we are just seeing the peak of the iceberg,” Sylvie Briand, WHO’s epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention chief, acknowledged in a briefing to countries on the “unusual” spread of the virus.Since Britain first reported a confirmed monkeypox case on May 7, nearly 200 cases have been reported to the UN health agency in countries far from the states where the virus is endemic.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has put the number of such cases at 219.Endemic in a number of west and central African nations, monkeypox cases have suddenly been detected in more than 20 other countries around the world, including the United States, Australia, the United Arab Emirates and nearly a dozen EU countries.The Spanish health ministry said Friday that 98 cases had been confirmed there so far, while Britain currently counts 90 verified infections.Portugal has meanwhile registered 74 confirmed cases, health authorities said Friday, adding that all the occurrences are in men, mainly aged below 40. “We are still at the very, very beginning of this event,” Briand told member state representatives attending the World Health Assembly in Geneva.“We know that we will have more cases in the coming days,” she said, but stressed there was no need to “panic”.“This is not a disease the general public should be worried about. It is not Covid or other diseases that spread fast.”Monkeypox is related to smallpox, which killed millions around the world every year before it was eradicated in 1980.But monkeypox is much less severe, with a fatality ratio of three to six percent. Most people recover within three to four weeks.The initial symptoms include a high fever, swollen lymph nodes and chickenpox-like rash.While many of the cases have been linked to men having sex with men, experts stress there is no evidence it was a sexually transmitted disease. Rather, it seems to be transmitted by close contact with an infected person who has blisters on their skin.There is not much in the way of treatment, but some antivirals developed against smallpox exist, including one that was recently approved by the European Medicines Agency against smallpox, Briand pointed out.Vaccines developed for smallpox have also been found to be about 85 percent effective in preventing monkeypox.However, since smallpox has not posed a threat in more than four decades, most people under the age of 45 have not received the vaccine, and the supplies of the jabs are today very limited.Briand said experts were trying to determine what had spurred this “unusual situation”, saying preliminary investigations did not seem to indicate that the virus that causes monkeypox had changed or mutated.She voiced hope that the spread could be halted.“We have a good window of opportunity to stop the transmission now,” she said.“If we put in place the right measures now, we probably can contain this easily.”"

Everyone who had come into contact with him had been informed, it added in a statement.“As far as we know, the person concerned was exposed to the virus abroad,” the statement added.Health officials became aware of the case on Friday, and it was confirmed as monkeypox the following day.Switzerland thus joins several western countries, including Britain, Germany, Spain, Sweden the United Kingdom and the United States in reporting cases, raising fears the virus may be spreading.Symptoms of the rare disease include fever, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion and a chickenpox-like rash on the hands and face.The virus can be transmitted through contact with skin lesions or droplets from a contaminated person, as well as through shared items such as bedding or towels.Monkeypox usually clears up after two to four weeks, according to the World Health Organization.The World Health Organization’s regional director for Europe Hans Kluge warned on Friday that cases could accelerate in the coming months, as the virus spread across Europe.Most initial cases of the disease have been among men who have sex with men and sought treatment at sexual health clinics, Kluge said, adding “this suggests that transmission may have been ongoing for some time”.The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is investigating the fact that many cases reported were people identifying as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/228-probable-unexplained-cases-of-child-hepatitis-who/,228 probable unexplained cases of child hepatitis: WHO,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — At least 228 probable cases of hepatitis of unknown origin in children have now been reported to the World Health Organization from 20 countries, the UN health agency said Tuesday, May 3.“As of May 1, at least 228 probable cases were reported to WHO from 20 countries, with over 50 additional cases under investigation,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters in Geneva.Most of the cases are from Europe but there are others in the Americas, the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia, he said.The WHO was first informed on April 5 of 10 cases in Scotland detected in children under the age of 10. More than 100 cases have now been recorded in Britain.Some cases have caused liver failure and required transplants. At least one child is known to have died.Many cases reported jaundice, and gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting.The WHO refers to the outbreak of severe liver inflammations as acute hepatitis of unknown origin among young children.“It is not yet clear if there has been an increase in hepatitis cases, or an increase in awareness of hepatitis cases that occur at the expected rate but go undetected,” it says on its website.“While adenovirus is a possible hypothesis, investigations are ongoing for the causative agent,” it added.Adenoviruses are generally known to cause respiratory symptoms, conjunctivitis or even digestive disorders.After the discovery of the first 169 cases, the WHO said common viruses that cause acute viral hepatitis (hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E) were not detected in any of them."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-probes-five-child-deaths-109-cases-linked-to-mystery-liver-disease/,US probes five child deaths,1,"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating 109 childhood cases of a mysterious form of hepatitis, including five reported deaths, the agency said Friday.It is part of an unexplained global phenomenon involving hundreds of cases, with Indonesia this week also reporting three deaths.Britain on Friday announced its case count had increased to 163, the majority aged under five, with no deaths.“Investigators both here… and around the globe are working hard to determine the cause,” said Jay Butler, deputy director for infectious diseases for the CDC.Health authorities think the cases might be linked to a wave of type of virus called adenovirus, but are trying to confirm the theory.Ninety percent of the US cases have involved hospitalization, with 14 percent requiring liver transplants. The median age of the cases is two-years-old, and the majority fully recovered.The CDC issued a health alert in late April notifying doctors and public health authorities to be on the lookout for similar cases, and began examining records extending back to October 1, 2021.A study released last week focusing on nine cases in Alabama ruled out other common exposures, including hepatitis viruses A, B, and C, which are normally the cause of the disease.The CDC does not think the cases are linked to Covid vaccination because the “vast majority” of cases are too young to be eligible, said Butler.Jaundice and vomiting are the most common symptoms experienced by the children affected. More than half the cases tested positive for adenovirus 41 — a virus that is normally associated with gastroenteritis, but not hepatitis in otherwise healthy children.“Because of the link to adenovirus, I would call that top of the list of viruses of interest,” said Butler.“But we don’t know if it is adenovirus itself that is causing the cases, or is there an immune reaction to this particular strain of adenovirus.”Environmental factors are also being examined.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued a technical report Friday that found that 70 percent of households where data was available had dogs, and said “the significance of this finding is being explored.”Other working hypotheses include co-infection with another pathogen such as Covid, or whether a prior case of Covid had made children more susceptible.Adenovirus cases might also be rebounding after Covid lockdowns stopped the spread for a few years, or lack of exposure to pathogens during lockdowns might have made children’s immune systems more susceptible.The adenovirus might have also evolved into a newer, more dangerous strain.Adenoviruses are commonly spread by close personal contact, respiratory droplets and surfaces. There are more than 50 types of adenoviruses, which most commonly cause the cold, but also several other diseases.CDC recommends preventive action such as hand-washing, avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs and sneezes, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth.Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA, said in a statement: “It’s important that parents know the likelihood of their child developing hepatitis is extremely low.“However, we continue to remind everyone to be alert to the signs of hepatitis –- particularly jaundice, look for a yellow tinge in the whites of the eyes –- and contact your doctor if you are concerned.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/moderna-seeks-us-authorization-for-covid-vaccine-in-children-under-6-statement/,109 cases linked to mystery liver disease,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — US biotech firm Moderna said Thursday it had submitted a request for an emergency use authorization in the United States for its Covid vaccine for children aged six months to under six years.Children under six are the only age group that has yet to gain access to a Covid-19 vaccine in the United States and in most countries.“We believe (this vaccine) will be able to safely protect these children against SARS-CoV-2, which is so important in our continued fight against Covid-19 and will be especially welcomed by parents and caregivers,” the company’s CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.In March, the company announced results from a trial that showed the two-shot regimen was found to be safe and produced a strong immune response.Specifically, two doses of 25 micrograms given to babies, toddlers and preschoolers generated similar levels of antibodies as two doses of 100 micrograms given to young people aged 18-25, indicating there would be similar levels of protection against serious cases of the virus.The trial included 4,200 children aged two to six years and 2,500 babies aged six months to two years.Side effects were generally mild and consistent with those seen in older age groupsThe company did, however, find relatively low efficacy against infection, with its trial taking place during the Omicron variant wave.The current generation of vaccines were designed against the original strain of the virus.Vaccine efficacy in children six months up to age two was 51 percent, and efficacy was 37 percent in the two to five years age group, when limiting the analysis to only cases confirmed positive on a positive PCR test.Moderna said these were similar to vaccine efficacy estimates in adults during Omicron, and it is also currently studying booster doses for all pediatric cohorts.The lower efficacy for two doses has the potential to present a stumbling block to authorization.Back in February, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) postponed a meeting of a panel to consider the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine for children younger than five, saying it wanted to see data on how three doses performed before considering the matter.The companies said at the time they expected that data to be ready in April, but haven’t provided an update since then.Scientists evaluating a vaccine for infants must closely consider the risk-benefit balance.Even when they are unvaccinated, children under five are at very low risk for severe disease. There have been only 476 deaths in the United States this age group since the start of the pandemic, according to official data.Among all US children, there have also been almost 8,000 cases of MIS-C, a post-viral inflammatory condition, that caused 66 deaths."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/nearly-60-of-us-population-had-covid-by-february/,Moderna seeks US authorization for Covid vaccine in children under 6: statement,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — By February of this year, 58 percent of the US population — more than 190 million people — had been infected with Covid, according to an antibody survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published Tuesday.The figure is far higher than the 80 million officially recorded cases, with the majority of infections undiagnosed, asymptomatic or unreported.Roughly 75 percent of people under 18 had been infected, according to a paper based on a nationally representative study of antibody levels.There was a huge surge during the winter Omicron wave, particularly among children.Each month from September 2021 to January 2022, the study examined some 75,000 blood specimens taken from across the country, as well as 45,000 samples in February.The study examined only antibodies created in response to prior infection, not vaccination.National estimates were then produced using statistical methods to weight by age, sex and metropolitan status.“Having infection-induced antibodies does not necessarily mean you are protected against future infections,” said Kristie Clarke, co-lead for the national Covid-19 serology task force, on a call with reporters.“Previous infection has been shown to provide some protection against severe disease and hospitalization — and vaccination, either before or after infection, provides additional protection,” she added.Since the duration of infection-conferred immunity is unknown, it remains vital to stay up to date with Covid vaccination, she stressed.The United States is currently offering fourth shots to people 50 and over, and third shots to people under that age.Pfizer on Tuesday said it had submitted an application to the Food and Drug Administration to authorize a third shot to children ages five to 11, following strong immune response data.Children five and under are the only group not yet eligible for vaccination.“The best way to protect them is to make sure that they are surrounded by people who are taking preventive measures, like staying up to date with our vaccines,” said Clarke. President Joe Biden’s administration meanwhile announced Tuesday it is doubling the number of outlets where at-risk Americans can obtain free Covid-19 therapeutic pills.Oral therapeutics such as Pfizer’s Paxlovid tablet are seen as an important new weapon in the struggle to knock out a virus that at its peak a year ago killed more than 3,000 people per day in the United States alone.White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain called Paxlovid a “miracle pill” and tweeted that “almost all Covid deaths can be prevented if people who test positive take” it.With 20 million pill packs ordered for government purchase, they are now “in ample supply” and distribution will be ramped up from the current 20,000 locations to close to 40,000, according to a White House official.Nationwide, cases are ticking up with infections caused by the BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 Omicron subvariants — including a rash of cases sweeping through the Washington elite.Vice President Kamala Harris tested positive Tuesday, but is asymptomatic and not considered a current close contact of Biden, the White House said.Upstate New York and the Northeast region are also experiencing an increase in hospitalizations, and the CDC recommends indoor masking in those areas, though mandates have long ceased to be in effect there.Even with rising hospitalizations, there has been a sharp reduction in fatalities, mainly as a result of rising population immunity, but also because the newer variants are intrinsically less severe than those that preceded them.Daily deaths stand at a little over 300 per day. The country is expected to reach the grim milestone of one million deaths in the coming weeks."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/the-quest-for-a-universal-coronavirus-vaccine/,Nearly 60% of US population had Covid by February,1,"As vaccine makers rush to stamp out new Covid-19 variants, some scientists have set their sights higher, aiming for a universal coronavirus vaccine that could tackle any future strains and possibly even stave off another pandemic.Since the race for a first Covid jab supercharged a new generation of vaccine technology, there have been numerous efforts to develop pan-coronavirus immunisation.Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania, who was a pioneer of the mRNA technology used in Pfizer’s Covid vaccine, is leading one such project.He said the problem with updating current vaccines to target all existing strains — a plan announced by Pfizer earlier this month — is that “new variants are going to appear every three or six months”.After more than two years simply trying to infect more people, he said, the virus is now starting to mutate specifically to get around the immunity gained from vaccines — much as influenza’s constant changing requires an updated shot every year.“That makes it a little bit trickier, because now you’re fighting head-to-head with the virus,” Weissman told AFP.So his team is working on a pan-coronavirus vaccine, which he said has tested well so far.They are trying to find “highly conserved epitope sequences” — more integral parts of the virus that cannot mutate readily because it would die without them.But it’s not going to be easy.“We may have a universal vaccine in two or three years, but we’re going to have to keep working on it and changing it over time to keep ahead of the virus,” Weissman said. Covid was not the first coronavirus to jump from animals to humans this century: its older relative SARS killed nearly 800 people from 2002-2004, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) followed in 2012.When US-based biotech firm VBI Vaccines announced its pan-coronavirus project in the early days of the pandemic in March 2020, it targeted all three.Francisco Diaz-Mitoma, VBI’s chief medical officer, explained the premise by likening each antigen of their proposed vaccine to one of the three primary colours.The firm hopes to provide antibodies not just for these three — but also for “the various shades of orange, green, and purple found in between”.“In other words, we are trying to teach the immune system to expand upon the variations of virus it is capable of ‘seeing’ from the start,” he told AFP.He said VBI’s vaccine had shown promising results so far — including in bats and pangolins — with clinical studies hoped to start in the coming months ahead of results in early 2023.The ferritin nanoparticle vaccine effort led by Barton Haynes, director of Duke University’s Human Vaccine Institute, has received funding from the US National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).He told AFP this vaccine, which targets SARS-like viruses but not a broader range of coronaviruses like MERS, had been shown to work well against Omicron. Pamela Bjorkman of the California Institute of Technology said a true pan-coronavirus vaccine was probably not realistic because there are so many lineages — some which include common colds.Her project uses a mosaic nanoparticle approach to target the B lineage of betacoronaviruses, which includes the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease Covid.Bjorkman told AFP that even the “quest” for this specific lineage was comparable to the “many years of effort to make a universal influenza vaccine.”Like Haynes, she said the wide availability of a vaccine depended on how quickly they could begin human trials.Even if none of the current pan-coronavirus vaccine projects are likely to be rolled out in the next year, their eventual arrival could change the world’s relationship with Covid.“If a pan-coronavirus vaccine is successfully able to establish a broader foundational immunity against coronaviruses, it would allow us, as a global society, to go from being one step behind, to leaping one step ahead of the pandemic,” Diaz-Mitoma said.The broadening horizons of vaccine research could also be one way Covid has forced the world to better prepare for the threat of even worse pandemics ahead.The US-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has earmarked $200 million (185 million euros) for pan-coronavirus research.But it also has a $3.5 billion (3.2 billion euro) plan it hopes will help develop a vaccine targeting “the next Disease X” within 100 days of it emerging — regardless of whether it is a coronavirus."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-strongly-recommends-pfizers-covid-pill/,The quest for a universal coronavirus vaccine,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization said Friday it “strongly recommended” Pfizer’s Covid-19 antiviral pill Paxlovid for patients with milder forms of the disease who were still at a high risk of hospitalization.However the UN agency warned it was “extremely concerned” that the inequality in access seen with Covid vaccines would again leave low- and middle-income countries “pushed to the end of the queue”.US pharma giant Pfizer’s combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir was the “superior choice” of treatment for unvaccinated, elderly or immunocompromised people with Covid, the WHO’s experts said in the BMJ medical journal.For the same patients, the WHO also made a “conditional (weak) recommendation” of the antiviral drug remdesivir made by US biotech firm Gilead — which it had previously recommended against.The WHO recommended Paxlovid over remdesivir, as well as over Merck’s molnupiravir pill and monoclonal antibodies.Pfizer’s oral treatment prevents hospitalization more than the “available alternatives, has fewer concerns with respects to harms than molnupiravir, and is easier to administer than intravenous remdesivir and antibodies,” the WHO’s experts said.The new recommendation was based on the findings of two trials involving almost 3,100 patients which showed that Paxlovid reduced the risk of hospital admission by 85 percent.The trials also “suggested no important difference in mortality” and “little or no risk of adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation”.The recommendation applies to people over the age of 18, but not to pregnant or breastfeeding women.It also does not apply to patients with a low risk of complications from the disease, because the benefit would be minimal.The WHO’s experts also declined to give an opinion for patients with severe forms of the disease, due to a lack of data. The WHO stressed the limitations of such antiviral treatments.“The medicine can only be administered while the disease is at its early stages,” they said.This means the patients must quickly test positive and be prescribed the pill by a doctor — all of which can pose obstacles for low- and middle-income countries, the WHO said.Yet Covid pills have been seen as a potentially huge step in ending the pandemic as they can be taken at home, rather than in hospital.Patients must start taking their Paxlovid pills within five days of the onset of symptoms — the course then lasts five days.Remdesivir can be taken within seven days of symptoms setting in, but it is administered intravenously over three days. The WHO called on Pfizer to “make its pricing and deals more transparent” for Paxlovid.Lisa Hedman, the WHO’s senior advisor on access to medicines, said that radio station NPR reported a full course of Paxlovid costs $530 in the United States. Another source unconfirmed by WHO gave the price of $250 in an upper-middle income country.Remdesivir meanwhile costs $520, Hedman said, but generic versions made by companies in India sell for $53-$64.There is also a question mark over whether the virus could build resistance to these treatments.But earlier this month Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla predicted a bright future for treatments like Paxlovid as people grow tired of getting further booster vaccinations.Coming under fire for prioritizing wealthy countries with its vaccine, Pfizer has agreed to allow some generic drug makers around the world to make cheaper versions of Paxlovid under a UN-backed scheme.But on Friday the WHO “strongly recommended” that Pfizer let more generic manufacturers produce the drug and “make it available faster at affordable prices”.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-experts-insist-covid-still-a-global-emergency/,WHO ‘strongly recommends’ Pfizer’s Covid pill,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The WHO’s emergency committee on Covid-19 on Wednesday unanimously affirmed that the virus remains a major public health danger and insisted that countries must stop dropping their guard.With many nations relaxing public health and social measures, and drastically reducing testing for the virus, the World Health Organization’s group of experts said the pandemic was far from being at an end.“Now is not the time to let our guard down — on the contrary, and this is an extremely strong recommendation,” committee chair Didier Houssin told a press conference.“The situation is far from over with regard to the Covid-19 pandemic, the circulation of the virus is still very active, mortality remains high and the virus is evolving in an unpredictable way,” the French doctor warned.“Now is not the time for relaxation on this virus, nor weakness in surveillance, testing and reporting, nor laxity in public and social health measures and no resignation when it comes to vaccination.”The committee meets every three months to discuss the pandemic and reports to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.It concluded that the pandemic still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) — the highest level of alert that the WHO can sound. The committee declared the Covid-19 outbreak a PHEIC on January 30, 2020, when, outside of China, fewer than 100 cases and no deaths had been reported.Though it is the internationally-agreed mechanism for triggering an international response to such outbreaks, it was only Tedros after describing the worsening situation as a pandemic on March 11 that many countries woke up to the danger.“The committee unanimously agreed that the Covid-19 pandemic still constitutes an extraordinary event that continues to adversely affect the health of populations around the world, poses an ongoing risk of international spread,” it said in a statement Wednesday.Globally, in the week to Sunday, the number of new Covid-19 cases and deaths continued to decline for a third consecutive week, with more than seven million cases and over 22,000 deaths reported.This was the lowest number of Covid deaths since the early days of the pandemic.However, some countries are still witnessing serious spikes in cases, which is putting pressure on hospitals, said Tedros, adding that the world is “still in the middle of the pandemic”.“This virus has over time become more transmissible and it remains deadly especially for the unprotected and unvaccinated that don’t have access to health care and antivirals,” he said.Tedros urged people to get vaccinated and continue wearing masks, especially in crowded indoor spaces.The WHO said the Omicron variant accounted for 99.2 percent of samples collected in the last 30 days that have been sequenced and uploaded to the GISAID global science initiative, with the previously-dominant Delta variant now less than 0.1 percent.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/20-countries-still-below-10-covid-jab-rate-who-experts/,WHO experts insist Covid still a global emergency,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — Twenty mostly African countries have still not vaccinated even 10 percent of their population against Covid-19, the World Health Organization’s vaccine advisers lamented Monday.The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) said the speed of the Covid jab rollout had been “unprecedented”.However, 20 countries — down from 34 in January — had still not managed a 10-percent immunisation rate, Kate O’Brien, the WHO’s vaccines chief, told reporters.“These are countries that are working really hard to advance their programmes. Supply is no longer the issue. The legacy of all the supply constraint from 2021 — the effects of that (are) still being felt,” she said.SAGE said vaccination coverage among the groups most vulnerable to severe Covid-19 disease was not enough to give them the protection they needed.Health worker coverage is at 65 percent overall.“That’s certainly a very, very strong position to be in, but we’re really carrying the message forward that it needs to be 100 percent,” said O’Brien.Coverage in the over-60s is at 69 percent — though the figure falls to 24 percent in some regions of the world.So far, the WHO has authorized eight Covid-19 vaccines and versions thereof, giving them the green light with its emergency use listing (EUL) status.SAGE said that available data on their effectiveness against the Omicron variant of Covid-19 generally showed waning immunity against infection but high and more sustained effectiveness against severe disease and death — especially after booster doses.However, it added: “Data remain very limited for some of the WHO EUL vaccines” in their performance against Omicron.The WHO EUL-approved vaccines are those made by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Janssen, Moderna, Sinovac, Sinopharm, Bharat Biotech and Novavax.SAGE had data on the first five of those, said O’Brien, but for some it had “a lot more evidence than others”.Studies were only just starting to come out on the Sinovac jab, she said. “We don’t have real-world evidence in the Omicron era for other products that are WHO EUL.”The Covax facility, founded to ensure the poorest 92 countries in the world get access to Covid-19 jabs with the cost covered by donors, has so far shipped 1.42 billion vaccine doses to 145 territories, according to UNICEF, which handles the logistics.The scheme has sufficient supply available for all those countries to achieve the WHO’s 70-percent coverage target by June, said SAGE.Covax can only use WHO EUL vaccines.Cravioto said SAGE had reviewed the CanSino vaccine and would produce its usage recommendations for the jab once the WHO gave it the EUL green light, “hopefully in the next weeks”.It would be the third Chinese vaccine authorised by the WHO.Cravioto described the EUL jabs as “wonderful products to finish the job”, adding: “The best way to finish the pandemic is for all of us to be vaccinated.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/vaccine-supply-outstrips-demand-access-inequity-remains/,20 countries still below 10% Covid jab rate: WHO experts,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — After two years of racing to vaccinate the world against Covid-19, the number of available doses now surpasses demand in many areas.Yet a yawning gap remains in vaccination rates between the richest and poorest countries.On Friday, Gavi, which co-leads the Covax global distribution scheme, is holding a summit calling for more funds to address the issue of inequality in vaccine access. More than 13 billion doses have been produced since the pandemic, 11 billion of which have been administered, according to the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA).Science research group Airfinity expect nine billion more doses to be produced this year. Pfizer alone plans to make four billion doses.Yet demand could fall to six billion doses this year, IFPMA’s director general Thomas Cueni said.“Since mid-2021, global vaccine production has exceeded global vaccine demand and this gap has continuously risen,” Cueni told AFP.By next year, production could exceed demand by 1.3 to 3.1 billion doses, he added.Many richer nations are now approaching oversupply. European Union and G7 countries had a surplus of 497 million doses at the end of last month.There are fears that doses could go to waste. Covid vaccines have a relatively short shelf-life — AstraZeneca and Novavax’s jabs have a six-month expiry date.Airfinity says 241 million doses have passed their sell-by date so far during the pandemic. Nevertheless, billions of people remain unvaccinated around the world, most of them in developing nations.Covax, an international public-private partnership co-led by WHO and Gavi, has delivered 1.4 billion doses to 145 countries — far short of the planned two billion doses by end-2021.World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned that inequality in vaccine access could lead to the emergence of new, possibly more contagious variants.The WHO wants 70 percent of every country’s population vaccinated by July.But records are uneven.Nearly 80 percent of France’s population, for example, has received two doses. But only 15 percent of the population on the continent of Africa is fully vaccinated, according to Oxford University data.An average of 42 percent of the population of 92 low- and middle-income countries participating in Covax have had one dose.“Vaccine inequity is the biggest moral failure of our times and people and countries are paying the price,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said earlier this year.Covax says it now has enough doses to vaccinate around 45 percent of the population in the 92 countries receiving donations. But 25 of those countries lack the infrastructure for an effective immunisation campaign.Making matters worse, many developing countries are being donated doses too close to their expiry date.UNICEF’s supply division director Etleva Kadilli said that in December almost more than 100 million doses had been refused, “the majority due to product shelf life”.Gavi has ruled that doses must be valid for at least 10 weeks on arriving in countries. Countries like South Africa and India have long called for the World Trade Organization to suspend intellectual property rights for vaccines and anti-Covid treatments, so they can massively boost production.After fierce opposition from pharmaceutical giants, a first compromise was reached between the United States, European Union, India and South Africa last month.But several key countries like Switzerland have yet to sign on. Doctors Without Borders also says there are “key limitations” in the deal, such as covering only vaccines and geographical limits.Pharmaceutical companies argue that patents are not the real problem.Cueni of IFPMA, a big pharma lobby group, said the problem was now logistics.“What we need is money to have storage, transportation, more trained health workers, campaigns to counter misinformation: these are the real challenges and not the patent waiver,” he said. Current vaccines target the virus that swept the world in 2020. While they greatly reduce the risk of serious illness from Covid, they only provide partial protection — particularly against newer variants such as the now dominant Omicron.Several vaccine manufacturers have begun testing jabs that target Omicron. They have hit delays but could be available in a few months, if approved by health authorities.And despite the billions yet to receive a first dose, the United States, Britain, France and Israel have started rolling out a fourth, starting with the most vulnerable.On Wednesday, the EU’s medicines watchdog approved a second booster for people aged 80 years and over.“No country can boost its way out of the pandemic,” Tedros has warned."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/omicron-lasts-three-days-less-than-delta-for-boosted-study/,Omicron lasts three days less than Delta for boosted: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — People who are vaccinated and have had a booster shot against Covid-19 recover from symptoms from the Omicron variant more than three days earlier than those with the Delta variant, a study said Friday.The study also found that people with Omicron are significantly less likely to lose their sense of smell, and confirmed previous research that it is less severe.To find out the differences in how Omicron and Delta make sufferers sick, researchers used a free smartphone app called ZOE on which more than 63,000 vaccinated people in Britain aged 16-99 self-reported their Covid symptoms between June 2021 and January 2022.For those with two vaccine doses plus a booster, symptoms from Omicron lasted 4.4 days, compared to 7.7 for Delta — a difference of 3.3 days.People who had two doses but no booster shot saw Omicron symptoms clear up in 8.3 days, compared to 9.6 days for Delta, according to the study published in the Lancet medical journal.The swifter recovery suggests “that the period of infectiousness might be shorter, which would in turn impact workplace health policies and public health guidance,” the researchers said.The study, which will be presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Lisbon later this month, also found that only 17 percent of those with Omicron lost their sense of smell, compared to 53 percent for Delta.However people with Omicron had a 55-percent increased risk of getting a sore throat, and were 24 percent more likely to develop a hoarse voice.The study also found that Omicron patients were 25 percent less likely to be admitted to hospital.Study author Cristina Menni of King’s College London said it was the first peer-reviewed paper with a large number of participants that looked at the different symptoms of the two variants.While the study covered a period before the Omicron BA.2 variant swept the world, “recent data from the app show no change in symptoms in BA.2 compared to BA.1,” she told AFP."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/viruses-that-could-save-millions-of-lives/,Viruses that could save millions of lives,1,"TBILISI, Georgia (AFP) — It may seem strange after a pandemic that has killed millions and turned the world upside down, but viruses could save just as many lives.In a petri dish in a laboratory in the Georgian capital Tbilisi, a battle is going on between antibiotic resistant bacteria and “friendly” viruses.This small nation in the Caucasus has pioneered research on a groundbreaking way to tackle the looming nightmare of bacteria becoming resistant to the antibiotics on which the world depends.Long overlooked in the West, bacteriophages or bacteria-eating viruses are now being used on some of the most difficult medical cases, including a Belgian woman who developed a life-threatening infection after being injured in the 2016 Brussels airport bombing.After two years of unsuccessful antibiotic treatment, bacteriophages sent from Tbilisi cured her infection in three months.“We use those phages that kill harmful bacteria” to cure patients when antibiotics fail, Mzia Kutateladze of the Eliava Institute of Bacteriophages told AFP.Even a banal infection can “kill a patient because the pathogen has developed resistance to antibiotics,” Kutateladze said.In such cases, phagotherapy “is one of the best alternatives”, she added.Phages have been known about for a century, but were largely forgotten and dismissed after antibiotics revolutionised medicine in the 1930s. It didn’t help that the man who did most to develop them, Georgian scientist Giorgi Eliava, was executed in 1937 on the orders of another Georgian, Lavrentiy Beria, Stalin’s most notorious henchman and the head of his secret police.Eliava had worked in the Pasteur Institute in Paris with French-Canadian microbiologist Felix d’Herelle, one of the two men credited with discovering phages, and persuaded Stalin to invite him to Tbilisi in 1934.But their collaboration was cut short when Beria had Eliava killed, although his motive still remains a mystery.With the World Health Organization now declaring antimicrobial resistance a global health crisis, phages are making a comeback, especially as they can target bacteria while leaving human cells intact.A recent study warned that superbugs could kill as many as 10 million people a year when antimicrobial resistance due to overuse of antibiotics reaches a tipping point. That could come within three decades. While phages-based medicines cannot completely replace antibiotics, researchers say they have major pluses in being cheap, not having side-effects nor damaging organs or gut flora.“We produce six standard phages that are of wide spectrum and can heal multiple infectious diseases,” said Eliava Institute physician Lia Nadareishvili.In some 10 to 15 percent of patients, however, standard phages don’t work and “we have to find ones capable of killing the particular bacterial strain,” she added.Tailored phages to target rare infections can be selected from the institute’s massive collection — the world’s richest — or be found in sewage or polluted water or soil, Kutateladze said.The institute can even “train” phages so that “they can kill more and more different harmful bacteria.”“It is a cheap and easily accessible therapy,” she added. A 34-year-old American mechanical engineer suffering from a chronic bacterial disease for six years told AFP he “already felt improvement” after two weeks at the Tbilisi institute.“I’ve tried every possible treatment in the United States,” said Andrew, who would only give his first name.He is one of the hundreds of patients from around the globe who arrive in Georgia every year for last-resort treatment, said Nadareishvili.With the traditional antimicrobial armoury depleting rapidly, more clinical studies are needed so that phagotherapy can be more widely approved, Kutateladze argued.In 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised a clinical study on the use of bacteriophages to cure secondary infections in Covid patients.Beyond medicine, phages are already being used to stop food going off, and they “can be used in agriculture to protect crops and animals from harmful bacteria,” Kutateladze said.The institute has already conducted research on bacteria targeting cotton and rice.Bacteriophages also have potential to counter biological weapons and combat bioterrorism, with Canadian researchers publishing a 2017 study on using them to counter an anthrax attack on crowded public places."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/private-jets-soar-past-global-pandemic-oil-price-woes/,Private jets soar past global pandemic,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) – Airlines may find themselves swept up in unprecedented turbulence — with air travel shunned over climate concerns, plagued by pandemic shutdowns and soaring oil prices — but for private jet operators, business is booming.The appeal of private jets has taken off since the start of the pandemic, amid fear of catching Covid-19 and as widespread cancellations and stringent measures have turned flying commercial into a logistics headache.“The impact of Covid really forced people to look elsewhere for their travel needs,” said Philippe Scalabrini, who heads the southern European division of the international private aviation company VistaJet.“Anyone who can afford it wants an entire plane at their disposal,” he told AFP, adding that “private aviation, as whole, has had an incredible surge of demand over the past two years.”Numbers from air traffic regulator Eurocontrol appear to confirm that.It found that private air travel nearly doubled its global market share between 2019 and 2021, when it stood at 12 percent.Standing inside the newest addition to the VistaJet fleet, the Global 7500 built by Canadian business jet maker Bombardier, Scalabrini showed off what air travel can look like in that exclusive market.Abord the luxury plane, costing a whopping $72 million (65 million euros), clients can enjoy plush cream-coloured leather chairs, a large double bed, and wine tasting.To limit jet lag, the cabin pressure can be better regulated than on commercial flights, allowing clients to sleep as soundly “as at their cabin in Saint-Moritz”, the chic Alpine ski resort, Scalabrini said.And their pets can travel in luxury as well, with toys and treats on demand.With annual contracts starting at 500,000 euros ($550,000), VistaJet’s target audience includes wealthy individuals and business leaders, with growing numbers from the tech sector.“Obviously we see the evolution of clients following the macro-trends we see in the world,” Scalabrini said.More than anything, the pandemic has driven the latest upsurge in demand.Scalabrini said “the Covid effect” last year helped VistaJet swell the number of flying hours sold by 90 percent.And the company, founded in 2004 by Swiss billionaire Thomas Flohr, announced last month the purchase of Air Hamburg, in a move it said would help grow its flying hours by another 30 percent.That announcement, however, landed just three days before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Western countries unleashed a slew of harsh sanctions, sparking panic on markets and sending oil prices soaring.Scalabrini said it was “a bit early” to determine how the crisis would affect his company.“At the moment we cannot fly to Russia, we cannot fly to Ukraine unfortunately, so obviously there is an impact, but it’s a minimal impact,” he said, pointing out that Russian clients made up less than five percent of VistaJet’s turnover.“We’ve got clients all over the world.”While private jet companies may weather the crises currently gutting commercial aviation, they face the same outrage over air travel’s outsized contribution to climate change.A private jet flight pollutes 10 times more than a commercial flight, according to the Transport and Environment NGO.Environmental questions will in the long term be one of the biggest challenges facing business air travel, Philippe Berland, an air transport specialist with the Sia Partners consulting firm, told AFP.In the short term, however, he said the immediate question would be how the sector manages to absorb soaring oil prices, and also whether private jet companies can hold onto the clients they gained during the pandemic as commercial flights return to normal.“In this sector, where an hour of flying time is already very expensive, price is not the only factor,” Berland said, suggesting that some of the newly won clients may have grown accustomed to the ease and speed of departures with private jets.Pascal Fabre, aviation expert with the Alix Partners consultancy, said the sector was not very sensitive to rising oil prices.When you buy a plane “for several tens of millions of dollars,” he told AFP, “the fuel bill is not an issue.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/australia-battles-spread-of-japanese-encephalitis/,oil price woes,1,"SYDNEY, Australia (AFP) — Australia said Friday it is buying extra vaccines to fight the potentially deadly, mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus, which has spread down the flood-hit east coast for the first time.Previously confined to the tropical north, Japanese encephalitis has traveled as far south as South Australia since late February — infecting 17 people and leading to two confirmed deaths, according to state health authorities.More extreme rainfall events have brought greater numbers of mosquitos to eastern Australia, one scientist said, as the country battles higher temperatures blamed on climate change that means the atmosphere holds more moisture.There is no specific treatment for the disease, which is spread only by mosquito bites.Fewer than one percent of people infected may develop a serious illness such as encephalitis, which is an inflammation of the brain tissues, Australia’s federal health ministry said.Symptoms include neck stiffness, severe headache and coma, and “more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death”, it warned.Australia’s health and agriculture ministries said the government would invest Aus$69 million (US$51 million) on control measures including buying an additional 130,000 vaccine doses, bolstering the 15,000 now in stock, and improved surveillance.The vaccines — Imojev produced by Sanofi-Aventis Australia and JEspect made by Seqirus — are to be targeted at people working close to mosquitoes and to pigs, which are vulnerable to infection.Australian states confirming Japanese encephalitis infections included New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, which had never before reported locally acquired infections.Queensland, also impacted by the spread, had previously only reported one case.Japanese encephalitis is a common cause of viral brain infections in Asia, said New South Wales public health pathology director Dominic Dwyer.“It has not come by boat or plane like Covid-19, but probably by migratory birds visiting inland waterways and then mosquitoes, whose numbers have increased in eastern Australia with the wetter conditions, heavy rains and floods,” he wrote in a report published in the Sydney Morning Herald.Australia’s east coast is emerging from a two-week rain and flooding disaster that killed more than 20 people as it engulfed a string of towns and swept cars from the roads.Scientists say climate change is making Australia’s floods, bushfires, cyclones and droughts more frequent and more intense.Pigs may amplify the presence of the Japanese encephalitis virus if infected animals are bitten again by mosquitoes, scientists say.Dwyer said it was not known if feral pigs — of which there are millions across the country — had a role in its spread.Australia’s agriculture minister, David Littleproud, said mosquitoes were being trapped at all infected piggeries.“A national surveillance plan is being developed to identify and locate infected mosquitoes, birds, pigs — including feral pigs — horses, and humans,” he said.He stressed that commercially produced pork meat was safe to consume.“There are no food safety concerns,” Littleproud said.State governments advised people to try to avoid mosquito bites, including by covering exposed skin, using repellents, removing containers of water where they may breed, staying indoors at dawn and dusk, and steering clear of the insects in wetland and bush areas.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-frustration-two-years-on-since-pandemic-declaration/,Australia battles spread of Japanese encephalitis,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — Friday marks two years to the day since the World Health Organization first described Covid-19 as a pandemic, shaking countries into action as the disease ripped around the planet.The once-in-a-century pandemic has turned the world upside down, claiming more than six million lives and infecting at least 450 million people.But the WHO voiced its frustration at people marking the second anniversary of March 11, 2020, insisting that the real alarm came six weeks earlier — but few people bothered to sit up and take notice.The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) — the highest level of alarm in the global health regulations — on January 30, 2020, when, outside of China, fewer than 100 cases and no deaths had been reported.But it was only when WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the worsening situation as a pandemic on March 11 that many countries seemed to wake up to the danger.The WHO is not marking the anniversary — and two years on is still irked that governments did not heed the original alert.“The world was possessed with the word pandemic,” said WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan.“The warning in January was way more important than the announcement in March.“Do you want the warning to say you’ve just drowned, or would you like the warning to say the flood is coming?”– Ryan said the PHEIC declaration fell on deaf ears.“People weren’t listening. We were ringing the bell and people weren’t acting,” he told a live interaction on the WHO’s social media channels on Thursday.“What I was most stunned by was the lack of response, the lack of urgency in relation to WHO’s highest level of alert in international law, as agreed by all our member states. They agreed to this!”He said the declaration of a pandemic was simply stating the obvious once it had already happened — and insisted countries had plenty of advance notice.“There’s a lot of people in the media and everywhere have this big argument, WHO declared a pandemic late. No!” said Ryan.“The world was well warned about the impending pandemic.“By March, I think there was such frustration that it was, ‘OK, you want a pandemic, here’s your pandemic’.”By March 11, 2020, the number of cases outside China had increased 13-fold, with more than 118,000 people having caught the disease in 114 countries, and 4,291 people having lost their lives, following a jump in deaths in Italy and Iran. Tedros’s use of the word came at around 5:30 pm during a press conference on Covid-19, which by this stage was already being held largely online via Zoom.He said it six times in quick succession — and 10 times in all.“We’re deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction,” Tedros said.“We have therefore made the assessment that Covid-19 can be characterised as a pandemic. Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly.”Ryan was alongside him that day, as was Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19.Two years on, she said that this Friday, people would be marking the “wrong anniversary”.“It is fundamentally incorrect,” she insisted.“You hear the frustration in our voices because we still haven’t corrected the narrative.“It will happen again! So when are we actually going to learn?“More than six million people have died, that we know of. I don’t think we’ve even begun to grieve this, at a global level.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-has-taken-severe-mental-health-toll-who/,WHO frustration two years on since pandemic declaration,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) – The Covid pandemic has taken a dire toll on mental health, the WHO said Wednesday, indicating that cases of anxiety and depression had swelled by over 25 percent globally.The brief, which was based on an umbrella review of a vast number of studies, determined that the world saw a 27.6-percent increase in cases of major depressive disorder in 2020 alone.During the first year of the pandemic, there was also a 25.6-percent hike in cases of anxiety disorders worldwide, it found.“In terms of scale, this is a very large increase,” said Brandon Gray of WHO’s mental health and substance use department, who coordinated the scientific brief.The brief, he told AFP, “shows that Covid-19 has had a large impact on people’s mental health and wellbeing.”The greatest increases were found in places that were heavily affected by Covid-19, in terms of high daily infection rates and decreased mobility due to restrictions, the study found.Women and girls were more affected than males, and younger people, especially those between the ages of 20 and 24 were more affected than older adults.Data on suicides was meanwhile mixed, and did not clearly show a change in global rates since the start of the pandemic.Data from some countries showed rising rates, but others showed that rates had decreased or remained the same.But Gray pointed out that there is often a delay in collecting and analysing such statistics.“I don’t think these results should be taken to indicate that suicidal behaviours is not a concern,” he said.The study meanwhile did indicate a higher risk of suicidal behaviours, including suicide attempts and self harm, among young people since the start of the crisis.Exhaustion among health workers, loneliness and positive Covid-19 diagnoses were meanwhile shown to increase the risk of suicidal thoughts, it found.The study also showed that people living with mental disorders had an increased risk of severe illness and death from Covid.Gray said more research was needed to understand the link.One reason, he suggested, might be that people living with mental disorders may lead less healthy and active lifestyles, with higher rates of smoking, substance abuse and obesity than among the general public.Wednesday’s study also showed that outpatient mental health services were widely disrupted in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, decreasing access to essential care.These disruptions were mitigated in many cases by shifting services towards online healthcare.While this was good news, the study pointed out that the shift obviously exacerbated barriers to proper care for people with little internet access or low levels of technological literacy.The difficulties in responding to mental health challenges amid the pandemic were largely a result of “chronic underinvestment” in such services before Covid-19 hit, Gray said.“The decades of underinvestment is showing up now in our lack of preparedness to address the scale of the problem,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/strong-protection-for-babies-born-to-covid-vaccinated-moms-study/,New Zealand virus cases spike as anti-vaccine protesters claim win,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Babies born to mothers fully vaccinated against the coronavirus during pregnancy were around 60 percent less likely to be hospitalized with severe Covid, a new study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.Such an effect had been hypothesized — because of the transfer of antibodies through the placenta during pregnancy and through breast milk after birth — but wasn’t backed by real world evidence until now.The CDC carried out a study involving 379 babies aged up to six months, who were hospitalized in 20 pediatric centers from July 2021 to January 2022.The authors studied the odds of Covid-19 vaccination among mothers whose babies were hospitalized with the disease (176 infants) compared to the odds of vaccination among mothers whose babies were hospitalized for non-Covid reasons (203 infants), who were a control group.This is a statistical method used in real world studies to try to examine patients with similar characteristics, and is often used when it’s not possible or ethical to carry out a randomized clinical trial.“Babies less than six months old whose mothers were vaccinated were 61 percent less likely to be hospitalized with Covid-19,” CDC researcher Dana Meaney-Delman said in a press call.What’s more, 84 percent of babies who were hospitalized with Covid were born to people not vaccinated in pregnancy. The one baby who died in the study was born to a mother who was not vaccinated.Black and Hispanic babies were disproportionately hospitalized for Covid.“The bottom line is that maternal vaccination is a really important way to help protect these young infants,” said Meaney-Delman.The study further found that completion of a two-dose vaccine series later in pregnancy was more protective than earlier in pregnancy — 80 percent compared to 32 percent.Although that is consistent with what is known about the waning of antibody levels in the months that follow vaccination, Meaney-Delman said it was important for people to get vaccinated at any stage during pregnancy in order to protect both the mother and baby.“If we have a woman who comes in in the first trimester and is vaccinated she can actually be eligible for a booster vaccine later in pregnancy,” she said, but added it was premature for the agency to recommend boosters specifically for the pregnant.A limitation of the study was it began during the early phase of vaccine rollout and did not include mothers who were vaccinated prior to pregnancy.That could be a topic for future evaluation, the paper’s authors wrote.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/swiss-vote-to-ban-nearly-all-tobacco-advertising/,Strong protection for babies born to Covid-vaccinated moms: study,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) – The Swiss voted on Sunday to tighten their notoriously lax tobacco laws by banning virtually all advertising of the hazardous products.Nearly 57 percent of voters and 16 of Switzerland’s 26 cantons backed the near-total tobacco advertising ban, final results showed.“We are extremely happy. The people understood that health is more important than economic interests,” Stefanie De Borba of the Swiss League against Cancer, told AFP.Switzerland lags far behind most wealthy nations in restricting tobacco advertising — a situation widely blamed on substantial lobbying by some of the world’s biggest tobacco companies headquartered in the country.Currently, most tobacco advertising is legal at a national level, except on television and radio, and when specifically targeting minors.Some Swiss cantons have introduced stricter regional legislation and a new national law is pending, but the campaigners who forced the issue to a vote under Switzerland’s direct democracy system demanded far tighter rules.Opponents of the initiative, which include the Swiss government and parliament, argued that it goes too far.“Today we are talking about cigarettes, but we will soon be talking about alcohol and meat,” warned Philippe Bauer, a parliamentarian with the right-wing Liberal Party, decrying “this dictatorship of the politically correct, where everything has to be regulated”.His concerns echo those voiced by Philip Morris International (PMI), the world’s largest tobacco company, which, like British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco, is headquartered in Switzerland and has helped fund the “No” campaign.“This is a slippery slope as far as individual freedom is concerned,” a spokesman for PMI’s Swiss section told AFP.He decried Sunday’s result and urged parliament to show “moderation and measure” when drafting the decision into law.Jean-Paul Humair, who heads a Geneva addiction prevention centre, hailed Sunday’s win as “a very important step” in the battle against tobacco use, and flatly rejected the industry’s arguments.“This is not a question of freedom… It is an illusion of freedom,” he told AFP, pointing out that tobacco use creates severe dependency.“There is no other consumer product that kills half of all users.”Campaigners say lax advertising laws have stymied efforts to bring down smoking rates in the Alpine nation of 8.6 million people, where more than a quarter of adults consume tobacco products. There are around 9,500 tobacco-linked deaths each year.Pascal Diethelm, head of the OxyRomandie tobacco control group, told AFP that Sunday’s vote should help lead to a “change of paradigm” for federal authorities.“(They) have been accepting for too long that health prevention policy be put under the tutelage of big business,” they said.The tobacco industry contributes around six billion Swiss francs ($6.5 billion, 5.7 billion euros) to the economy annually — one percent of Switzerland’s gross domestic product — and accounts for some 11,500 jobs.Swiss Health Minister Alain Berset meanwhile stressed to journalists that it could take time for the near-ban to take effect.“It really does not seem possible that it could take effect this year,” he said.The new tobacco advertising restrictions could conceivably be added to a new tobacco law already due to take effect next year, and which for the first time will set a nationwide minimum age for the purchase of tobacco products.Other issues on Sunday’s ballot did not fare as well in the polls.Nearly 80 percent of voters rejected a call to ban all animal testing.All political parties, parliament and the government had opposed the initiative, arguing it went too far and would have dire consequences for medical research.In another animal-themed vote, inhabitants in the northern Basel-Stadt canton also massively rejected a bid to afford non-human primates some of the same basic fundamental rights as their human cousins, with nearly 75 percent opposed.More than 55 percent of voters also rejected a plan by the national government to provide additional state funding to media companies, which have seen their advertising revenues evaporate in recent years.Nearly 44 percent of eligible Swiss voters took part Sunday, which is not unusually low in a country where such popular votes are held every few months.© Agence France-Presse"

Also, the vaccine was originally billed as a single-shot inoculation.Additional plants are being outfitted to make the vaccine, but production is not expected until late spring, the Times said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-laments-tragic-500000-covid-death-toll-since-omicron/,WHO laments ‘tragic’ 500,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization lamented Tuesday that half a million Covid-19 deaths had been recorded since the Omicron variant was discovered, calling the toll “beyond tragic”.The WHO’s incident manager Abdi Mahamud said that 130 million cases and 500,000 deaths had been recorded globally since Omicron was declared a variant of concern in late November.It has since rapidly overtaken Delta as the world’s dominant Covid variant because it is more transmissible, though it appears to cause less severe illness.“In the age of effective vaccines, half a million people dying, it’s really something,” Mahamud told a live interaction on the WHO’s social media channels.“While everyone was saying Omicron is milder, (they) missed the point that half a million people have died since this was detected.“It’s beyond tragic.”Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, said the sheer number of Omicron cases was “astounding”, while the true number of cases and deaths would be much higher than just those known about.“It makes the previous peaks look almost flat,” she said.“We’re still in the middle of this pandemic. I hope we’re getting closer to the end of it,” she said. “Many countries have not passed their peak of Omicron yet.”Van Kerkhove said she was extremely concerned that the numbers of deaths had increased for several weeks in a row.“This virus continues to be dangerous,” she said.The WHO is tracking four sub-lineages of Omicron. While the BA.1 sub-strain was dominant, BA.2 is more transmissible and is expected to account for an increasing share of Omicron cases.Van Kerkhove said there was no indication thus far to suggest that BA.2 resulted in more severe Covid disease than BA.1, but stressed that it was still “very early days” in evidence-gathering.Mahamud added that it was as yet unknown whether someone could be infected with both BA.1 and BA.2 at the same time.Covid-19 has killed nearly 5.75 million people since it emerged in China in December 2019, according to an AFP tally compiled from official sources on Tuesday.Nearly 10.25 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered globally."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pfizer-sees-covid-19-drug-sales-topping-50-billion-in-2022/,000 Covid death toll since Omicron,1,"NEW YORK, United States (AFP) — Pfizer forecast more than $50 billion in 2022 sales for its Covid-19 vaccine and therapeutic on Tuesday as the pharmaceutical giant reported a more than doubling of annual profits on strong sales of its innoculation.Pfizer, whose vaccinee developed with German company BioNTech was the first approved in the United States to counter the deadly virus, sees slightly lower 2022 revenues for the vaccine compared with the just-finished year, but a big infusion of revenues from Paxlovid, the company’s pill for Covid-19.Chief Executive Albert Bourla described 2021 as a “watershed year” for Pfizer, adding that the company’s efforts in the pandemic “have fundamentally changed our company forever.”Still, shares fell Tuesday following the results, which lagged estimates in terms of fourth-quarter revenues.Besides vaccines, sales were mixed across Pfizer’s other divisions. Revenues dipped for internal medicine and inflammation and immunology, but rose for oncology, hospitals and rare disease.Analysts have also projected higher 2022 profits compared with the company’s forecasts.– Heavy interest in therapeutic – Pfizer reported annual profits of $22 billion, more than double the 2020 level. Annual revenues nearly doubled to $81.3 billion, with $36.8 billion from the Covid-19 vaccine.The company projected 2022 revenues of between $98 and $102 billion.The results are the latest to show how the coronavirus has transformed Pfizer, which a year ago had projected just $15 billion in Covid-19 vaccines sales in 2021 and ended up selling more than twice that amount after repeatedly lifting the forecast.For 2022, Pfizer expects $32 billion in revenue from Covid-19 vaccines and $22 billion in revenues from Paxlovid.Bourla said the company is currently working on a new vaccine candidate based on the Omicron variant of Covid-19, as well as a new “potential next-generation oral Covid-19 treatment.”The company expects to produce 120 million treatment courses for Paxlovid, with six million in the first quarter and 30 million the first half of 2022.Pfizer executives described heavy interest in Paxlovid, with ongoing contract talks with about 100 governments around the world. The treatment has so far been approved in about 40 countries.Bourla said the sales for Paxlovid “could be way bigger” than current forecasts. The 2022 estimate of $22 billion is based on signed contracts and negotiations where there is essentially an agreement, he said.However, Chief Financial Officer Frank D’Amelio cautioned that there was “less potential upside” to 2022 estimates for Covid-19 vaccine revenues, compared with 2021 “when the vaccine was newly available and few people had received any doses of the vaccine.”Morningstar’s Damien Conover estimated that Covid-19-related products will account for $60 billion in revenues in 2022, but fall to close to $5 billion by 2025.“We expect increased near-term utilization of Covid vaccines will reduce the demand for these vaccines and treatments over the long term,” Conover said in a note. “We view Pfizer as slightly overvalued, with the market likely extrapolating strong Covid vaccine and treatment sales too far into the future.”Bourla said the company’s scientists “continue to monitor the Covid-19 virus and believe it is unlikely that it will be fully eradicated in the foreseeable future.”“That said, we now have the tools — in the forms of vaccines and treatments — that we believe will help enable us to not only better manage the pandemic but also help countries move into the endemic phase,” he said.Shares fell 2.8 percent to $51.70.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/new-highly-virulent-hiv-strain-discovered-in-the-netherlands/,Pfizer sees Covid-19 drug sales topping $50 billion in 2022,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Oxford researchers announced Thursday the discovery of a highly virulent strain of HIV that has been lurking in the Netherlands for decades, but because of the effectiveness of modern treatments, is “no cause for alarm.”Their analysis, published Thursday in the journal “Science,” showed that patients infected with what they call the “VB variant” had 3.5 to 5.5 times higher levels of the virus in their blood than those infected with other variants, as well as a more rapidly fading immune system.However, the study also found that after starting treatment, individuals with the VB variant had similar immune system recovery and survival to individuals with other HIV variants.“There’s no cause for alarm with this new viral variant,” said Oxford epidemiologist Chris Wymant, the lead author on the paper, in an interview with AFP.The variant likely arose in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the Netherlands, according to the researchers, but began to decline around 2010.Since modern interventions still seem to work on the variant, the research team believes that widespread HIV treatment in the Netherlands did not contribute to the virus’s evolution, and that early detection and treatment are paramount.“Our findings emphasize the importance of World Health Organization guidance that individuals at risk of acquiring HIV have access to regular testing to allow early diagnosis, followed by immediate treatment,” said co-author Christophe Fraser, also an Oxford researcher, in a press release announcing the findings.The work also supports the theory that viruses can evolve to become more virulent, a widely-hypothesized idea for which few real-world examples have been found.The Delta variant of the novel coronavirus was another recent example.The discovery of the HIV variant should therefore “be a warning that we should never be overconfident about saying viruses will just evolve to become milder,” said Wymant to AFP.In total, the team found 109 people infected with the VB variant, with only four living outside the Netherlands, but still in western Europe.The HIV virus is constantly evolving, so much so that each person infected has a slightly different version.The VB variant, however, was found to have over 500 mutations.“Finding a new variant is normal, but finding a new variant with unusual properties is not — especially one with increased virulence,” Wyman explained.The research team first identified the VB variant in 17 HIV positive individuals by parsing a broad data set from the BEEHIVE project, a data collection and analysis initiative in Europe and Uganda.Because 15 of the 17 were from the Netherlands, they further studied data from 6,700 HIV-positive Dutch individuals, identifying 92 others.The earliest appearance of the VB variant in their data was found in someone diagnosed in 1992 who had an early version of the variant, and the most recent in 2014.Other researchers have since found other individuals with the variant diagnosed after 2014.Doctors usually measure HIV’s deterioration of the immune system by monitoring the decline of CD4 T-cells, which are targeted by the HIV virus and pivotal for protecting the body against infections.In patients infected with the VB variant, CD4 decline occurred twice as fast compared to other variants, “placing them at risk of developing AIDS much more rapidly,” the researchers said.In addition to its increased impact on the immune system, the team also found the VB variant to be more highly transmissible.They came to that conclusion after comparing the different versions of the VB variant drawn from infected patients.The fact that they were so similar suggests that the virus passed rapidly to someone else before it could accumulate many mutations.“Because the VB variant causes a more rapid decline in immune system strength, this makes it critical that individuals are diagnosed early and start treatment as soon as possible,” the press statement noted.“This limits the amount of time HIV can damage an individual’s immune system and jeopardize their health,” added Fraser.Fraser is also the principal investigator of the BEEHIVE project, which was launched in 2014 to gather data on how mutations in the HIV virus can lead to varying degrees of severity among patients.Those differences have previously been thought to mostly relate to the strength of individuals’ own immune systems.The researchers said they could not identify which genetic mutation in the VB variant caused its virulence, but they hope future studies will be able to.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/worlds-first-malaria-vaccine-making-inroads-in-western-kenya/,New ‘highly virulent’ HIV strain discovered in the Netherlands,1,"SAIYA, Kenya (AFP) — Lucy Akinyi’s three children were infected with malaria so often she would be at their local health clinic in western Kenya every other week getting them treated.When offered the chance to protect her children with the world’s first vaccine against the deadly parasitic disease, Akinyi jumped at the chance.More than 100,000 children in malaria-endemic western Kenya have received the new vaccine against the disease, which kills 260,000 children under five every year in sub-Saharan Africa.A pilot programme has been rolling out the groundbreaking drug — which was 30 years in the making — in Kenya, Ghana and Malawi since 2019.It was approved for broad use for children in sub-Saharan Africa and other at-risk regions by the World Health Organization (WHO) in October last year.For Akinyi and her extended family, the vaccine has worked wonders.She would always place mosquito nets over her children while they slept, but despite her best efforts they would still get bitten outside while playing.“We used to have a lot of malaria in our home. We could be at the hospital three times in a month,” Akinyi said.But none of her children have tested positive for malaria since being vaccinated, she said, bringing her great comfort living in a region where the disease is a major killer.“We are very happy because none of our children are sick,” Akinyi said.Her sister-in-law, Millicent Akoth Oyoya, decided to get her own children jabbed after seeing the benefit it brought her nieces and nephews.“When she (Akinyi) had her youngest vaccinated, that baby never got malaria,” Oyoya said at a clinic as she waited to get her nine-month-old boy vaccinated in the Lake Victoria region.“So I decided to bring mine too so that he would be malaria free.”Health clinics in western Kenya — where paediatric wards full of children sickened by malaria are not uncommon — are starting to see results.Admissions for malaria are falling, as is the severity of symptoms.“Since we started administering the malaria vaccine in September 2019, we have seen a reduction of the cases of malaria,” said Elsa Swerua, head nurse for malaria at Akala Health Center in Siaya County.“Even the children who get malaria, it is not severe, and the number of deaths out of malaria has also gone down.”Less malaria — the same person can suffer many episodes of the disease every year — means fewer trips to the hospital, a boon for families who struggle to pay for treatment again and again.“Before the vaccine… we would spend a lot of money on treatment and buying and going to the hospital. The cost was high,” Akinyi said.Now, there is more money to go around for food and other essentials, she said.Dr Simon Kariuki, chief research officer at the Kenya Medical Research Institute, and a leading expert on malaria, said the vaccine was a game changer.“We showed that this vaccine is safe, and can be given to young African children who bare the higher burden of malaria,” he said.The pilot trial had shown the vaccine could “reduce malaria incidents in young children in these areas by almost 40 percent”, he said.The WHO has recommended that the vaccine be administered in a four-dose regimen for children from five months of age in areas with moderate to high transmission of malaria.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pfizer-seeks-us-approval-of-covid-vaccine-for-children-under-5/,World’s first malaria vaccine making inroads in western Kenya,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Pfizer and BioNTech said Tuesday they are seeking emergency authorization from US health regulators for use of their Covid vaccine for children aged over six months and under five years.If the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes the two-shot regimen, it will become the first Covid vaccine available to this age group in the United States.The companies said Tuesday that they started submitting their formal application “following a request” from the FDA, which seemingly wants to get the process moving quickly.In a tweet soon after the announcement, the FDA said it will hold a meeting in two weeks, on February 15, to consider the request.“Having a safe and effective vaccine available for children in this age group is a priority for the agency,” said interim FDA head Janet Woodcock, who added that the FDA asked for the application “in light of the recent Omicron surge.”The companies are seeking authorization for only two doses of their vaccine, but believe a third will be needed “to achieve high levels of protection against current and potential future variants,” Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.“If two doses are authorized, parents will have the opportunity to begin a Covid-19 vaccination series for their children while awaiting potential authorization of a third dose,” he added.To limit side effects for this young age group, Pfizer chose to significantly decrease the dosage of its vaccine, opting for only three micrograms per jab versus 30 for those over 12 years old, and 10 for ages five to 11.The company’s researchers concluded last fall that low doses of the vaccine provided protection in children up to two years old but not in those aged two to five, and announced in December they would add a third dose to their trials.Data on the three-dose regimen is “expected in the coming months and will be submitted to the FDA to support a potential expansion” of this initial request, Pfizer and BioNTech said in the statement.If the FDA authorizes the emergency use of the vaccine, an advisory committee for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will then meet to decide to recommend its use or not.There are about 23 million children under the age of five in the United States, and two years after the pandemic began, many parents are waiting impatiently to vaccinate their young children against the coronavirus.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved three months ago for emergency use in children from five to 11, but uptake has been relatively slow.In that age group, only 30 percent have received at least one dose and around 22 percent are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Young children are less susceptible to falling seriously ill with Covid-19, but some nonetheless end up hospitalized by the virus.New pediatric Covid hospitalizations hit a record high in the United States in December as the Omicron strain spread rapidly.Some cases of the life-threatening illness MIS-C (multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children), have also been reported in young children with Covid.CDC data shows that about 400 children aged four and under have died from Covid-19 in the United States since the pandemic began.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/omicron-sub-variant-found-in-57-countries-who/,Pfizer seeks US approval of Covid vaccine for children under 5,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — A sub-variant of the highly contagious Omicron coronavirus strain, which some studies indicate could be even more infectious than the original version, has been detected in 57 countries, the WHO said Tuesday.The fast-spreading and heavily mutated Omicron variant has rapidly become the dominant variant worldwide since it was first detected in southern Africa 10 weeks ago.In its weekly epidemiological update, the World Health Organization said that the variant, which accounts for over 93 percent of all coronavirus specimens collected in the past month, counts several sub-lineages: BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2 and BA.3.The BA.1 and BA.1.1 — the first versions identified — still account for over 96 percent of all the Omicron sequences uploaded to the GISAID global science initiative, it said.But there has been a clear rise in cases involving BA.2, which counts several different mutations from the original — including on the spike protein that dots the virus’s surface and is key to entering human cells.“BA.2- designated sequences have been submitted to GISAID from 57 countries to date,” WHO said, adding that in some countries, the sub-variant now accounted for over half of all Omicron sequences gathered.The UN health agency said little was known yet about the differences between the sub-variants, and called for studies into its characteristics, including its transmissibility, how good it is at dodging immune protections and its virulence.Several recent studies have hinted that BA.2 is more infectious than the original Omicron.Maria Van Kerkhove, one of the WHO’s top experts on Covid, told reporters Tuesday that information about the sub-variant was very limited, but that some inital data indicated BA.2 had “a slight increase in growth rate over BA.1”Omicron in general is known to cause less severe disease than previous coronavirus variants that have wreaked havoc, like Delta, and Van Kerkhove said there so far was “no indication that there is a change in severity” in the BA.2 sub-variant.She stressed though that regardless of the strain, Covid remained a dangerous disease and people should strive to avoid catching it.“We need people to be aware that this virus is continuing to circulate and its continuing to evolve,” she said.“It’s really important that we take measures to reduce our exposure to this virus, whichever variant is circulating.”© Agence France-Presse"

A booster dose remains under an emergency use authorization.The FDA said clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of Spikevax included 14,287 vaccine recipients and 14,164 placebo recipients.The most common side effects by clinical trial participants were pain at the injection site, fatigue, headaches, muscle or joint pain, chills, nausea or vomiting and swollen lymph nodes, the FDA said.It said there was an increased risk in men aged 18 to 24 of myocarditis — inflammation of the heart muscle — and pericarditis — inflammation of tissue surrounding the heart — following vaccination with the second dose.But, the FDA said, it has determined that the “benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in individuals 18 years of age and older.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/inaccurate-covid-vaccine-disinfo-fuels-medical-myths/,‘Inaccurate’: Covid vaccine disinfo fuels medical myths,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Disinformation around Covid vaccines has existed as long as the jabs themselves.Unverified studies, unproven claims and out-of-context data are regularly shared on websites and social media across the globe — fuelling dangerous myths about the virus and the vaccines.As Austria becomes the first European Union country to make vaccines mandatory this week, AFP looks at some common disinformation surrounding the jabs:A common concern about the Covid vaccines is that they can cause harm, or even death, to those who get them.Some websites claim to link health risks to the jabs. Others offer information that is then used by people as alleged proof that vaccines are dangerous.The US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a database that reports alleged harm caused by vaccines.The website is open to the public, and anyone can submit a report.But VAERS makes it clear that it cannot be used as proof of vaccine harm.“A VAERS report does not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused the health problem, only that the symptoms occurred after vaccination,” it says in its search engine training video.If a symptom occurs after vaccination, it does not necessarily mean that the symptom occurred as a result of the vaccination — a matter of causation versus chronology.The VAERS site makes it clear that reports “may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable”.But VAERS data has been used by French politician Martine Wonner to claim 54 American children had died as a result of Covid jabs.Wonner used the data to argue that French children should not be vaccinated.Leading medical bodies in the United States and Europe have said that rare side effects can occur as a result of some of the vaccines — blood clots or myocarditis, for example — but that the benefits of taking the jabs outweigh the risks.Other common medical myths have no scientific proof but persist, for example that the vaccines can weaken the immune system, cause infertility or modify our DNA.A December post from a US website claimed Covid-19 shots caused something called “vaccine acquired immune deficiency syndrome”, citing a study.But the study in question — which covered waning effects of vaccines over time — made no mention of any such “syndrome”.One of its authors confirmed to AFP that the post amounts to “misinformation”.The bogus health claims don’t end there.One video created in 2020 that continued to be shared online into 2021 claimed that “97 percent of corona vaccine recipients will become infertile”, citing a “Big Pharma whistleblower”.But infertility is not cited as a side effect in any vaccine so far — for coronavirus or anything else.“There’s no vaccine in the world that can cause infertility,” Katharine White, an obstetrics and gynaecology professor at Boston University School of Medicine, told AFP when asked about the matter last year.Claims about some vaccines altering DNA have also taken hold online.They involve mRNA vaccines, which tell the body to produce proteins that resemble those of the virus instead of using a component or modified virus, as seen in the flu vaccine, for example.The technology has led some to believe untrue claims that the vaccines interfere with people’s genes.But our genes are located in a special part of our cells called the nucleus, and mRNA jab material does not access that part of our bodies.That means it is impossible for the material to reach our DNA.Statistics surrounding vaccines are often taken out of context or distorted to show they are ineffective.In France, for example, some people point to official figures that say there are more Covid cases in vaccinated people than in unvaccinated people.But since such a large portion of France’s population is vaccinated — more than 75 percent — it is not surprising that Covid cases are occurring among the vaccinated.Covid vaccines are known to help prevent severe illness and death — but they do not necessarily prevent the virus from spreading.That means that cases still occur among the vaccinated, and there will be more cases among the vaccinated if a greater number of people are vaccinated.And if, for example, 100 percent of a population is vaccinated, any occurrence of infection or hospitalisations will be among the vaccinated.It is not a reflection of the vaccines, but rather a well-known phenomenon among statisticians known as “Simpson’s paradox”.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/tests-of-hiv-vaccine-using-mrna-technology-have-begun/,Tests of HIV vaccine using mRNA technology have begun,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Testing in humans of an HIV vaccine that uses messenger RNA technology has begun, the biotech firm Moderna and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative said Thursday.This Phase 1 trial is being carried out in the United States among 56 healthy adults who are HIV negative.Despite four decades of research, doctors have yet to develop a vaccine to protect people from the virus that causes AIDS, which kills hundreds of thousands of people around the world each year.But hopes have been stirred with the success of mRNA technology, which allowed for the development of Covid-19 vaccines in record time, including one from Moderna.The goal of the vaccine now being tested is to stimulate production of a kind of antibody called “broadly neutralizing antibodies,” or bnAbs, which can act against the many variants of HIV that are circulating today.The vaccine is supposed to teach B lymphocytes, which are part of the immune system, to generate these antibodies.In this trial, participants are injected with an immunogen — a substance that can trigger an immune response — and then a booster immunogen later.These substances will be delivered with mRNA technology.“The induction of bnAbs is widely considered to be a goal of HIV vaccination, and this is the first step in that process,” Moderna and the IAVI, a research organization, said in a statement.“Further immunogens will be needed to guide the immune system on this path, but this prime-boost combination could be the first key element of an eventual HIV immunization regimen,” said David Diemert, a lead investigator at one of the four sites where the trial is being carried out, George Washington University in the US capital.The immunogens used in this trial were developed by IAVI and the Scripps Research Institute, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Moderna.A first trial last year tested the first immunogen but without employing mRNA technology. It showed that the desired immune response was triggered in dozens of people taking part in the research.The next step was to bring in Moderna with its new mRNA technique.“Given the speed with which mRNA vaccines can be produced, this platform offers a more nimble and responsive approach to vaccine design and testing,” the Moderna-IAVI statement said.“The search for an HIV vaccine has been long and challenging, and having new tools in terms of immunogens and platforms could be the key to making rapid progress toward an urgently needed, effective HIV vaccine,” said Mark Feinberg, the CEO of IAVI.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-outbreak-on-ship-threatens-tonga-aid-efforts/,Covid outbreak on ship threatens Tonga aid efforts,1,"NUKU’ALOFA, Tonga (AFP) – A Covid-19 outbreak on an Australian warship threatened to disrupt Tonga eruption aid efforts Tuesday, as survivors of the deadly volcanic blast described how they fled with only the clothes on their backs.The January 15 eruption generated huge tsunami waves and blanketed the Pacific kingdom in toxic ash when it obliterated an uninhabited island with explosive forces more powerful than a nuclear bomb.Australia has led international relief efforts, rushing to get water and humanitarian supplies to the nation of 100,000.But officials in Canberra said 23 Covid-19 cases had been detected among the crew of the warship HMAS Adelaide, which is steaming towards the capital Nuku’alofa laden with aid.Tonga is one of the few places in the world that remains Covid-free and Australian Defence Minister Peter Dutton said the relief effort would not be allowed to jeopardise that status.Dutton said the ship would remain at sea while discussions were held with Tongan authorities to decide whether the crew would attempt “contactless” delivery of the much-needed supplies.“We’re not going to put the Tongan population at risk, but at the same time we want to deliver aid as quickly as possible,” he told Sky News Australia.New Zealand, France, Japan and China have also contributed to relief efforts in the wake of an event the Tonga government has described as an “unprecedented disaster”.One of the worst-hit areas was Mango island, the closest inhabited land to the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano, which lies about 65 kilometres (41 miles) north of Nuku’alofa.A local man was among three known fatalities from the disaster and Mango’s entire remaining population of 62 has been relocated to the main island of Tongatapu after tsunami waves washed away their homes.Kalisi Levani, 81, said the whole island shook and the sky turned black as she heard “explosions like shooting sounds”.“We all ran and we didn’t take anything,” she said.Levani said families fled to a small hill, the island’s only high ground, and she only made it over the rugged terrain with help from her son-in-law.“I told him to put me down, because if I don’t die from the tsunami, I’ll die from being exhausted,” she said.Community leader Reverend Kisina Toetu’u said the islanders prayed through the night as ash rained down on them, with women and children sheltering under a woven mat as men remained exposed to the elements.“It was only the next morning that some men, as a search party, went down to look for our missing person and saw the devastation, and that nothing was left,” he said.Asked if the community would return to Mango, Toetu’u said: “not in the near future”.“Everything is gone there, our homes, so we are here for now and then we will see what steps to take,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/omicron-sub-variant-throws-up-new-virus-questions/,Omicron ‘sub-variant’ throws up new virus questions,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Scientists are keeping a close watch on a recently-discovered sub-variant of the Omicron version of the Covid-19 virus to determine how its emergence could effect future pandemic spread.The initial Omicron variant has become the dominant virus strain in recent months but British health authorities have notably identified hundreds of cases of the latest version, dubbed BA.2, while international data suggest it could spread relatively quickly.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) identified more than 400 cases in Britain in the first ten days of this month and has indicated the latest variant has been detected in some 40 other countries, accounting for a majority of most recent cases in some nations including India, Denmark and Sweden.The UKHSA indicated Friday it had designated the BA.2 sub-lineage as a variant under investigation (VUI) as cases of it were on the increase even if, in Britain, the BA.1 lineage currently remains dominant.The authority underlined that “there is still uncertainty around the significance of the changes to the viral genome,” which required surveillance as, in parallel, cases in recent days showed a sharp rise in BA.2 incidence notably in India and Demark.“What surprised us is the rapidity with which this sub-variant, which has been circulating to a great extent in Asia, has taken hold in Denmark,” French epidemiologist Antoine Flahault told AFP.Scientists must evaluate how the virus, which has engendered the worst global health crisis in a century, continues to evolve and mutate. Its latest incarnation does not possess the specific mutation used to track and compare BA.1 against Delta, the previously dominant strain.BA.2 has yet to be designated a variant of concern — but Flahault says countries have to be alert to the latest development as scientists ramp up surveillance.“(France) expected a spike in contaminations in mid-January: It didn’t happen and perhaps that is due to this sub-variant, which seems very transmissible but not more virulent” than BA.1, he observed.“What interests us is if this (sub-variant) possesses different characteristics” from BA.1 in terms of contagiousness and severity, France’s public health agency said Friday.To date, only a handful of BA.2 cases have emerged in France — but the country is monitoring developments as they spread across the Channel. Flahault, director of the University of Geneva’s Institute of Global Health, says the watchword is not panic but “vigilance” as “for now we have the impression (BA.2 case) severity is comparable to” classic variant Omicron cases.“But there are numerous questions on the table” and a need to monitor properties of the new variant on the block.“Very early observations from India and Denmark suggest there is no dramatic difference in severity compared to BA.1,” tweeted Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College, London, adding the latest variant should not call into question the effectiveness of existing vaccines.Peacock stressed that “we do not currently have a strong handle on … how much more transmissibility BA.2 might have over BA.1. However, we can make some guesses/early observations.”He added that “there is likely to be minimal differences in vaccine effectiveness against BA.1 and BA.2. Personally, I’m not sure BA.2 is going to have a substantial impact on the current Omicron wave of the pandemic.“Several countries are near, or even past the peak of BA.1 waves. I would be very surprised if BA.2 caused a second wave at this point. Even with slightly higher transmissibility this absolutely is not a Delta-Omicron change and instead is likely to be slower and more subtle,” he forecast.French Health Minister Olivier Veran said Thursday that BA.2 did not look as if it would prove a game-changer as variants appear on the scene “fairly regularly”. But he indicated he would reserve judgment.“What we know for now is that (BA.2) more or less corresponds to the characteristics that we know of Omicron” mark one."

Antimicrobial resistance occurs as bacteria evolve to be immune to antibiotics.The World Health Organization has declared it a global health crisis, setting up a task force to study alternative treatments.One area of research involves bacteria-eating viruses called bacteriophages or simply phages.A case study published in Nature Communications on Tuesday described how doctors in Belgium used the therapy to heal a patient whose leg had been infected for nearly two years.Anais Eskenazi, who co-authored the case study and cared for the patient, described how a laboratory in Georgia found the virus in a sample of sewer water — where phages are plentiful due to the masses of bacteria.They isolated the one they determined would target the patient’s specific superbug, antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae.The treatment could applied intravenously, orally or topically — on the outside of the body — Eskenazi told AFP.“In this case, we used the topical administration… the wound was rinsed with a solution containing phages,” she said.Combined with antibiotics, the phage therapy healed the infection in three months, the study said.While phages have been used to treat infections in Russia and eastern Europe for over a century, they are largely overlooked in the EU and US.Eskenazi said potential reasons for this could include fear of exposure to viruses — though phages pose no threat to people.“Bacteriophages are not able to infect human cells, they are specific to bacteria,” Eskenazi said."

It has not,” he says, though he acknowledges there have been some moments of inspiration.Another medical worker approaches Pope, asking him to sign a patient’s death certificate. There is an empty bed visible in the ward, where a Covid-19 patient died during the night.Pope remembers the other patients he has lost. He says most don’t even realize they are dying, because they are so sedated.“We had a number of young people who died that we tried very hard to save, we just couldn’t,” he says.“You don’t want to put any kind of value judgment on people’s lives, but you at least can feel like if a 90-year-old passes away, they lived life.”“But not somebody who’s 25 or 18, which was (the age of) the youngest person that I took care of,” Pope says.The doctor says conditions have improved in the last two years, but he still laments the state of the pandemic.He says ICU beds have not been empty in some time, and that the hospital’s ER has recently become overrun as the Omicron variant sweeps through the country.He says he is not sure he wants to keep doing this work unless something changes.“I will not keep doing this. It is a drain,” he says.“I hope this is it. I hope this is the last big surge.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/natural-immunity-more-potent-than-vaccines-during-us-delta-wave-study/,Natural immunity more potent than vaccines during US Delta wave: study,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — During America’s last surge of the coronavirus driven by the Delta variant, people who were unvaccinated but survived Covid were better protected than those who were vaccinated and not previously infected, a new study said Wednesday.The finding is the latest to weigh in on a debate on the relative strengths of natural versus vaccine-acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2, but comes this time with the imprimatur of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The authors of the paper warned, however, against depending on infection as a strategy, given the higher risks to unvaccinated persons of hospitalization, long term impacts, and death, compared to vaccinated people.“Viruses are constantly changing, including the virus that causes Covid-19,” the CDC said in a statement.“The level of protection offered by vaccination and surviving a previous infection changed during the study period. Vaccination remains the safest strategy for protecting against Covid-19,” it added.The analysis was also carried out before the emergence of the Omicron variant, for which both vaccine and infection-derived immunity appear diminished, and before boosters were made widely available.The new study involved patients in New York and California between May 30 to November 30, 2021.Prior to Delta becoming dominant, vaccination conferred greater immunity than infection. But the relationship shifted when the variant became predominant in late June and July.By the week of October 3, case rates among vaccinated people without prior Covid were around six times lower in California and five times lower in New York compared to those who were unvaccinated and without prior Covid.But the rates were substantially lower among people with previous Covid, including around 29 times (California) and 15 times lower (New York) among unvaccinated persons with a previous diagnosis, compared to those who were unvaccinated and without prior Covid.Protection was highest among those who had both vaccination and prior Covid.Hospitalizations followed a similar pattern.Other research, including a notable paper from Israel in August, have similarly found that natural immunity was more potent than vaccines during the Delta surge.But the US CDC had previously taken the opposite position, based on pre-Delta data.“Further studies are needed to establish duration of protection from previous infection by variant type, severity, and symptomatology, including for the Omicron variant,” the paper concluded."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-pandemic-nowhere-near-over-who-chief/,Covid pandemic ‘nowhere near over’: WHO chief,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The Covid-19 pandemic is far from over, the World Health Organization chief said Tuesday, cautioning against a narrative that the fast-spreading Omicron variant is risk-free.“This pandemic is nowhere near over,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters from WHO’s headquarters in Geneva.Tedros warned against dismissing as mild the coronavirus variant Omicron, which has spread like wildfire around the globe since it was first detected in southern Africa in November.The Omicron variant of Covid-19 is much more contagious than previous strains but seems to cause less serious disease.That has triggered a debate on the virus passing from being a pandemic to becoming endemic — with the implication that the danger will have passed.But the WHO has warned that the sheer numbers of people infected will mean many vulnerable people are still falling seriously ill and dying.“Omicron may be less severe, on average, but the narrative that it is a mild disease is misleading,” Tedros said.“Make no mistake: Omicron is causing hospitalisations and deaths, and even the less severe cases are inundating health facilities.”He said there were indications that the Omicron-fuelled surge of Covid cases may have peaked in some countries.This, he said, “gives hope that the worst of this latest wave is done with, but no country is out of the woods yet.”Tedros said there was an urgent need to remove the pressure building on health systems, especially in countries that still have low vaccination coverage.“Now is not the time to give up and wave the white flag,” he said.“We can still significantly reduce the impact of the current wave by sharing and using health tools effectively, and implementing public health and social measures that we know work.”Data indicate that existing Covid vaccines are less effective in protecting against Omicron transmission than against previous strains.But Tedros stressed it remained vital to ensure broader, more equitable access to the jabs.“Vaccines may be less effective at preventing infection and transmission of Omicron than they were for previous variants, but they still are exceptionally good at preventing serious disease and death,” he said.Health experts warn that allowing Covid to spread unabated in some places dramatically increases the chance of new, more dangerous variants emerging.“With the incredible growth of Omicron globally, new variants are likely to emerge,” Tedros cautioned."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-approves-two-new-covid-19-treatments/,WHO approves two new Covid-19 treatments,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — The World Health Organization approved two new Covid-19 treatments on Friday, growing the arsenal of tools along with vaccines to stave off severe illness and death from the virus.The news comes as Omicron cases fill hospitals around the world with the WHO predicting half of Europe will be infected by March.In their recommendation in British medical Journal the BMJ, WHO experts said arthritis drug baricitinib used with corticosteroids to treat severe or critical Covid patients led to better survival rates and reduced need for ventilators.Experts also recommended synthetic antibody treatment Sotrovimab for people with non-serious Covid at highest risk of hospitalisation, such as the elderly, people with immunodeficiencies or chronic diseases such as diabetes.Sotrovimab’s benefits for people not at risk of hospitalisation were deemed insignificant and the WHO said its effectiveness against new variants like Omicron was “still uncertain”.Only three other treatments for Covid-19 have received WHO approval, starting with corticosteroids for severely ill patients in September 2020.Corticosteroids are inexpensive and widely available and fight inflammation that commonly accompanies severe cases.Arthritis drugs tocilizumab and sarilumab, which the WHO endorsed in July, are IL-6 inhibitors that suppress a dangerous overreaction of the immune system to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Baricitinib is in a different class of drugs known as Janus kinase inhibitors, but it falls under the same guidelines as the IL-6 inhibitors.“When both are available, choose one based on issues including cost and clinician experience,” the guidelines say.Synthetic antibody treatment Regeneron was approved by the WHO in September and the guidelines say Sotrovimab can be used for the same type of patients.The WHO’s Covid treatment recommendations are updated regularly based on new data from clinical trials.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/reduced-hospitalization-risk-shorter-stays-for-omicron-patients-us-study/,Reduced hospitalization risk,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — A preliminary US study of nearly 70,000 Covid positive people showed a substantially reduced risk of hospitalization and death from Omicron even after controlling for growing population immunity levels.People infected with Omicron were half as likely to be hospitalized, about 75 percent less likely to need intensive care, and around 90 percent less likely to die compared to those infected with the formerly dominant Delta variant, according to the paper.Of some 52,000 people infected with Omicron, none ended up on a ventilator, compared to 11 people from nearly 17,000 with Delta.Hospital stays lasted for a median of 1.5 days for Omicron compared to five days for Delta, and 90 percent of Omicron patients were discharged in three or fewer days.The analysis was conducted on data from the Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospital system, which serves a population of around 4.7 million people, between November 30, 2021, and January 1, 2022, when both strains were circulating widely.The findings build on accumulating population-level research from countries including South Africa and Britain, but also on animal and human tissue-based testing, which have found Omicron replicates better in the upper airways compared to the lungs.The new paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was carried out by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).“This study controlled for important key parameters such as age, sex, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior vaccination and comorbidities,” CDC director Rochelle Walensky told reporters on a briefing call Wednesday.The results thus suggest that Omicron is “intrinsically less severe than Delta,” and observed reductions in severe cases aren’t only the result of more people being vaccinated and infected over time, the paper said.In addition, while the study noted reduced vaccine efficacy against infection from Omicron, it also found substantial ongoing protection against severe outcomes.Walensky warned that the results should not lead to complacency, since Omicron’s extreme transmissibility is still stretching the United States’ already over-extended health care system and its exhausted health workers.The country is currently seeing an average of 750,000 cases a day — though that figure is soon expected to exceed a million — around 150,000 total Covid hospitalizations, and more than 1,600 daily deaths.President Joe Biden’s chief medical advisor Anthony Fauci predicted Tuesday that “Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody.”But he added that after the country emerged from its current wave, it would transition towards a future of living with the virus, with Covid vaccines moderating severe disease for the majority and effective treatments available for the most vulnerable.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/repeated-covid-boosters-not-a-viable-strategy-who/,shorter stays for Omicron patients: US study,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — WHO experts warned Tuesday that repeating booster doses of the original Covid vaccines is not a viable strategy against emerging variants and called for new jabs that better protect against transmission.An expert group created by the World Health Organization to assess the performance of Covid-19 vaccines said simply providing fresh jabs of existing Covid vaccines as new strains of the virus emerge was not the best way to fight the pandemic.“A vaccination strategy based on repeated booster doses of the original vaccine composition is unlikely to be appropriate or sustainable,” the WHO Technical Advisory Group on Covid-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-Co-VAC) said in a statement.The group said there could be a need to update the existing vaccines to better target emerging Covid variants, like Omicron which has spread rapidly and has been detected in 149 countries so far.And it called for the development of new jabs that not only protect people who contract Covid against falling seriously ill but also better prevent people from catching the virus in the first place.“Covid-19 vaccines that have high impact on prevention of infection and transmission, in addition to the prevention of severe disease and death, are needed and should be developed,” TAG-Co-VAC said.This, it said, would help lower “community transmission and the need for stringent and broad-reaching public health and social measures.”It also suggested that vaccine developers should strive to create jabs that “elicit immune responses that are broad, strong, and long-lasting in order to reduce the need for successive booster doses”.According to the WHO, 331 candidate vaccines are currently being worked on around the world.Until new vaccines have been developed, the group said, “the composition of current Covid-19 vaccines may need to be updated”.This would “ensure that (they) continue to provide WHO-recommended levels of protection against infection and disease by VOCs (variants of concern), including Omicron and future variants.”Just weeks after Omicron was first detected in southern Africa, it is becoming increasingly clear that it is not only far more transmissible than previous variants, but also better at dodging some vaccine protections.The WHO has so far given its stamp of approval to versions of eight different vaccines.TAG-Co-VAC stressed that those vaccines provide a high level of protection against severe disease and death caused by the various variants of the virus.It said preliminary data indicated the existing vaccines were less effective at preventing symptomatic Covid disease in people who have contracted the Omicron variant.But protection against severe disease, which is what the jabs were especially intended to do, “is more likely to be preserved”, it said.“However, more data on vaccine effectiveness, particularly against hospitalisation, severe disease, and death are needed, including for each vaccine platform and for various vaccine dosing and product regimens,” it said.In the meantime, TAG-Co-VAC echoed the WHO stance that “the immediate priority for the world is accelerating access to the primary vaccination”.The UN health agency has resisted the push in a growing number of countries to roll out blanket booster programmes in the battle against new concerning variants like Omicron.The WHO says this makes no sense as many people in poorer nations are still waiting for a first jab, dramatically increasing the chance of new, more dangerous variants emerging.So far, more than eight billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in at least 219 territories, according to an AFP count.But while over 67 percent of people in high income countries have received at least one jab, fewer than 11 percent have in low income countries, according to UN numbers.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/alleged-hybrid-coronavirus-mutation-deltacron-discovered-in-cyprus-likely-result-of-lab-error-experts/,Repeated Covid boosters not a viable strategy: WHO,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Experts said Monday that an alleged hybrid coronavirus mutation dubbed “Deltacron” reportedly discovered in a Cyprus lab is most likely the result of a lab contamination, and not a new worrying variant.Cypriot media reported the discovery Saturday, describing it as having “the genetic background of the Delta variant along with some of the mutations of Omicron”.While it is possible for coronaviruses to genetically combine, it is rare, and scientists analysing the discovery of so-called “Deltacron” say it is unlikely.“The Cypriot ‘Deltacron’ sequences reported by several large media outlets look to be quite clearly contamination,” Tom Peacock, a virologist with the infectious diseases department at Imperial College London, tweeted over the weekend. Jeffrey Barrett, the head of the Covid-19 Genomics Initiative at Britain’s Wellcome Sanger Institute, said the alleged mutations are located on a part of the genome that is vulnerable to error in certain sequencing procedures.“This is almost certainly not a biological recombinant of the Delta and Omicron lineages,” he said Monday.Scientists are eager to battle a deluge of disinformation about Covid-19, much of it circulating online.Last week, unverified reports emerged of a “flurona” or “flurone” virus circulating — a combination of the flu and the coronavirus — which the World Health Organization (WHO) dismissed Monday.“Let’s not use words like Deltacron, flurona or flurone. Please,” tweeted Maria van Kerkhove, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the WHO.“These words imply combination of viruses/variants and this is not happening,” she said.While people can suffer from influenza and coronavirus at the same time, the two viruses cannot combine.In contrast to new variants of Covid-19 such as Omicron, which greatly impact the course of the pandemic, cases of simultaneous infection of the flu and coronavirus are nothing new.Since the start of the pandemic, the coronavirus has given rise to dozens of variants, four of which have been designated “of concern” by the WHO: Alpha, Beta, Delta and Omicron."

Today, I endorsed ACIP’s vote to expand eligibility and strengthen our recommendations for booster doses,” US CDC Director Dr. Walensky said.“We now recommend that all adolescents aged 12-17 years should receive a booster shot 5 months after their primary series. This booster dose will provide optimized protection against COVID-19 and the Omicron variant,” she said.The US CDC director further encouraged “all parents to keep their children up to date with CDC’s COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.”"

I don’t know if and how it will be used.”Bourla said the existing regime of two vaccine shots and a booster has provided “reasonable” protection against serious health effects from Omicron.But a vaccine focused directly on the Omicron variant would also guard against breakthrough infections of a strain that has proven highly contagious, but has also resulted in many mild or asymptomatic cases.In a separate interview with CNBC Monday, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said the company is developing a booster that could address Omicron and other emerging strains in the fall 2022.“We are discussing with public health leaders around the world to decide what we think is the best strategy for a potential booster for the fall of 2022,” Bancel told the network.“We need to be careful to try to stay ahead of a virus and not behind the virus.”"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/pfizer-biontech-to-develop-mrna-based-shingles-shot/,Pfizer expects Omicron vaccine to be ready in March,1,"BERLIN, Germany (AFP) – Germany’s BioNTech and US pharma giant Pfizer, which together developed a Covid-19 vaccine in record time, said Wednesday they are working on a shingles shot using the same mRNA technology.Moderna meanwhile announced it had dosed its first volunteer for a vaccine against Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), the cause of mononucleosis.The three companies are leveraging the same mRNA technology they used to develop highly successful Covid-19 vaccines towards other diseases, in a potential breakthrough moment for modern medicine.Pfizer and BioNTech signed a partnership deal and are aiming for clinical trials to start in the second half of 2022, they said in a joint statement.“The collaboration aims to develop a new mRNA-based vaccine against shingles, leveraging the expertise and resources of both companies,” said Ugur Sahin, CEO and co-founder of BioNTech.The messenger RNA method made its debut with the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, which was the first jab against Covid to be approved in the West in late 2020.Shingles is a common disease around the world caused by reactivation of the same virus that causes chickenpox.It can lead to extremely painful, disfiguring skin patches, and in rare cases to facial paralysis, deafness and blindness.While there are currently approved vaccines for shingles, Pfizer and BioNTech said they wanted to develop an improved vaccine that potentially shows high efficacy and better tolerability.The coronavirus jab developed by US biotech Moderna together with the US government agency National Institutes of Health (NIH) also uses mRNA technology.Moderna said Wednesday it had dosed its first of 270 participants aged 18-30 in a clinical trial for the vaccine against EBV — a virus for which no vaccine is currently approved.EBV is highly common, thought to infect more than 80 percent of Americans by the age of 19. It is spread through bodily fluids, such as saliva, and typically contracted in early childhood or adolescence.Infections during teenage years are more symptomatic, and can lead to infectious mononucleosis (IM), sometimes called “kissing disease,” a condition that can cause fever, fatigue, sore throat and swollen lymph nodes.Patients can in some cases be affected for weeks or months, sometimes requiring hospitalization. EBV is also a “latent virus” that can be reactivated in rare cases.Scientists believe mRNA vaccines, which provoke an immune response by delivering genetic molecules containing the code for key parts of a pathogen into human cells, could be a game-changer against many diseases.They also take less time to develop than traditional vaccines, which are generally based on an inactivated pathogen, or a live but weakened form of a microbe.BioNTech is also working on an mRNA-based malaria vaccine backed by the World Health Organization, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the European Union, with trials due to start in late 2022.Pfizer is developing an mRNA flu jab, as is Moderna. Moderna is also developing a vaccine against HIV and flu, among others.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/weaker-virus-herd-immunity-omicron-sparks-cautious-hopes/,Calling Omicron ‘mild’ a mistake,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — With new versions forcing vaccine makers to re-test jabs, the virus that causes Covid-19 has proven highly unpredictable.But the latest variant to sweep the globe has persuaded some experts that long hoped-for collective immunity is in sight, and that the virus may be evolving into a relatively benign seasonal illness.Omicron has proven particularly contagious, infecting people thought to have immunity conferred by vaccines or a bout with the disease itself.But while Omicron it driving a record number of cases in countries around the world, the illness is generally less severe, compared to previous variants.More people getting Omicron and recovering, combined with more vaccinations, could be the key to boosting collective defences against almost any form of Covid, some experts have said.Lower rates of hospitalisation due to Omicron also suggests Covid-19 might evolve into a weaker form, similar to coronaviruses long circulating in the general population.“Perhaps we are witnessing the beginning of an evolution towards a more banal virus like the others we know,” said Alain Fischer, who coordinates France’s pandemic vaccine response.Clinical virologist Julian Tang reacting to a UK study on Omicron’s lesser severity, said he imagined one day repeat vaccination and other measures would only be necessary for the most vulnerable.“I am still hopeful that the virus will eventually become more like the other common cold coronaviruses –- perhaps over the next one to two years,” he said.These conjectures have been embraced by public health officials.Speaking before the legislature this week, French health minister Olivier Veran said “maybe this will be the wave that allows us to acquire a kind of immunity”.Earlier, his Israeli counterpart, Nachman Ash, told an Israeli radio station that herd immunity was “possible”.“But we don’t want to reach it by means of infections,” he said. “We want it to happen as a result of more people getting vaccinated.”In Israel, two thirds of the population is fully vaccinated. This week the government approved a fourth jab for people over 60 and health workers in a bid to fight the virus without resorting to a lockdown.Even if Omicron leads to fewer severe cases per million people, a larger proportion of the population infected means that hospitalisations are bound to increase overall.The World Health Organization (WHO) ahead of the holidays stressed the danger of many people getting infected with Omicron while the more severe Delta variant is still circulating.In the absence of herd immunity worldwide, Omicron is unlikely to be the last Covid variant, experts warn.“We aren’t there yet,” said Fontanet.“We can expect new variants to emerge, but as our immunity strengthens over time — either through natural infection or with booster doses of the vaccine — their ability to lead to serious consequences will diminish.”For epidemiologist Antoine Flahault, who heads up the Institute of Global Health in Geneva, all scenarios remain on the table.“If we want to start learning lessons from the recent past of this pandemic, let us remember that it is largely unpredictable,” he told AFP.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/soaring-omicron-could-lead-to-more-dangerous-variants-who-warns/,warns WHO,1,"STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AFP) — Soaring Omicron cases around the globe could increase the risk of a newer, more dangerous variant emerging, the World Health Organization in Europe warned on Tuesday.While the variant is spreading like wildfire around the world, it appears to be far less severe than initially feared and has raised hopes that the pandemic could be overcome and life return to more normality.But WHO senior emergencies officer Catherine Smallwood sounded an ominous note of caution, telling AFP that the soaring infection rates could have the opposite effect.“The more Omicron spreads, the more it transmits and the more it replicates, the more likely it is to throw out a new variant. Now, Omicron is lethal, it can cause death … maybe a little bit less than Delta, but who’s to say what the next variant might throw out,” Smallwood told AFP in an interview.Europe has registered more than 100 million Covid cases since the start of the pandemic, and more than five million new cases in the last week of 2021, “almost dwarfing what we have seen in the past”, Smallwood said.“We’re in a very dangerous phase, we’re seeing infection rates rise very significantly in Western Europe, and the full impact of that is not yet clear,” she said.Smallwood also noted that while “on an individual level there’s probably a decreased risk of hospitalisation” with the Omicron variant compared to Delta, overall, Omicron could pose a greater threat because of the sheer number of cases.“When you see the cases rise so significantly, that’s likely to generate a lot more people with severe disease, ending up in hospital and possibly going on to die,” she said.Britain on Tuesday faced warnings of an impending hospital crisis due to staff shortages caused by a wave of Omicron infections, as the country’s daily Covid caseload breached 200,000 for the first time.Smallwood said she expected that scenario to play out in other European countries as well.“Even in well-capacitated, sophisticated health systems there are real struggles that are happening at the moment, and it’s likely that these will play out across the region as Omicron drives cases upwards.”vk-po/lc© Agence France-Presse"

Nightclubs have been closed until well into January.In Spain, public festivities have been cancelled across most regions and in the biggest cities except Madrid, where a stripped-down gathering is scheduled with the crowd limited to 7,000 people compared to 18,000 in 2019 before the pandemic swept Europe.On Thursday, Britain’s National Health Service announced that it would start opening temporary field hospitals to contain a possible overspill of inpatients in England, where the government stopped short of mandating curbs on New Year festivities.“Given the high level of COVID-19 infections and increasing hospital admissions, the NHS is now on a war footing,” National Medical Director Stephen Powis said.Indonesia, which has reported more than 4.2 million confirmed cases, warned that foreign travellers may be deported from the resort island of Bali if they are caught violating Covid health rules during New Year.“Get ready to be kicked out,” Bali immigration office head Jamaruli Manihuruk told AFP. Bali has barred carnivals, fireworks and gatherings of more than 50 people over the Christmas and New Year period.Mexico City has also cancelled its massive New Year’s Eve celebrations as a preventative measure after a rise in Covid cases.“I feel that this casts doubt on a lot of what we thought was already secure, because it is scary, it is worrying,” said Aaron Rosas, an engineering student.“By doing that cancellation they are sending a message in a way: ‘You know what? This is serious’,” said teacher Victor Arturo Madrid Contreras.In Saudi Arabia, authorities reimposed social distancing measures at the Grand Mosque in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, after recording the highest number of infections in months.“I am highly concerned that Omicron, being more transmissible, circulating at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.“This is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers, and health systems on the brink of collapse.”Omicron has already started to overwhelm some hospitals in the United States, the hardest-hit country, where the seven-day average of new cases has hit 265,427, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker.Harvard epidemiologist and immunologist Michael Mina tweeted that the count was likely just the “tip of the iceberg” with the true number likely far higher because of a shortage of tests.“Half of my family has it,” said Victoria Sierralta at a testing site in Miami. “It’s like we’re back in like the first stage of Covid.

Now, only five to six people come to get the booster shot per day.”He said he calls herders daily to try and arrange the third shot but often can’t get through, especially with poor phone reception in pastureland.This meant health officials had no choice but to go to the herders, he added.After finding several ger homes empty, Sodkhuu — accompanied by doctor Enkhjargal Purev — met 37-year-old herder Enkhmaa Purev, who received the booster.“I was planning on getting my booster shot the next time I visited the soum (town) centre,” the herder told AFP, saying she had driven 160 kilometres (99 miles) earlier this year with her husband to get their first doses.Another herder, named Badamkhuu, couldn’t get the jab due to high blood pressure — a common problem among herders due to a high cholesterol diet.“I had extremely high blood pressure after the second dose [of Sinopharm], so I don’t want any more vaccines,” said 65-year-old herder Dulamsuren Gombojav, who also declined the jab when offered by Sodkhuu.According to Mongolia’s health ministry, there have been 667,391 Covid cases and nearly 2,000 deaths.Cases have plummeted since vaccines were rolled out, and Ulaanbaatar is anxious progress is not lost through jab hesitancy.Only around 45 percent of adults have had a booster vaccine.“Young people spread rumours or have a perception that Covid is just like flu, and they can recover easily, like the flu,” Sodkhuu told AFP on the outreach drive.“(They) think that they don’t need vaccines or boosters.”On the day AFP joined the medical team, they had hoped to administer booster shots to six herder families. Only three accepted.But Batbayar Ochirbat, the official leading the vaccination programme, said trust is gradually improving in the third jab.Since September when daily cases peaked at more than 3,000, numbers have rolled down to an average of 200 daily cases, which he says is partly down to boosters.“People started to build trust after they saw vaccinated people have booster shots, develop no symptoms, and not get sick,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"

They are more accurate because they can make millions of copies of the virus’ RNA, so even tiny amounts become detectable.© Agence France-Presse"

France on Wednesday opened vaccinations to children aged between five and 11, warning that daily infections rates could hit 100,000 by the end of the year, up from a weekly average of 54,000 daily cases. “There is one certainty,” said Health Minister Olivier Veran. “Omicron is very contagious, it will spread, and no country will be spared.” But vaccines did have an effect on the variant, he stressed.Britain approved Pfizer’s Covid jab for children aged five to 11, announced it would buy millions of Covid pills, and cut the isolation period for infected people from 10 to seven days with negative tests.It also signed deals to acquire 4.25 million courses of Pfizer’s ritonavir and US rival Merck/MSD’s molnupiravir antiviral drugs, which have raised hope for an easy at-home treatment.And Finland revealed plans to expand its vaccination programme to children aged between five and 12, a day after announcing bars must close at 9:00 pm on Christmas Eve to fight record Covid infection levels.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) meanwhile authorised Pfizer’s Covid pill for high-risk people aged 12 and over, calling it an important milestone in the pandemic that will allow millions to access the treatment. In China, only 52 new reported infections were enough for authorities to impose a stringent lockdown on more than 13 million people in the northern city of Xi’an.From midnight on Thursday, residents must stay at home except to buy necessities once every two days or in emergencies. Travel to and from Xi’an is heavily monitored by health authorities and non-essential businesses will close.The move comes as China pursues its rigorous zero-Covid policy before next year’s Winter Olympics in Beijing, reminiscent of the world’s first pandemic lockdown in the central city of Wuhan in January 2020.Belgium has announced cinemas, concert halls and other entertainment venues will have to close from the weekend as three in 10 Covid cases are now Omicron.Spain’s government said Wednesday it would re-impose the mandatory wearing of face masks outdoors at an unspecified future date.And in France an expert warned that the variant and any new rules could throw into doubt the staging of political rallies ahead of next year’s presidential elections.The all-too-familiar restrictions threatened festivities across the world, even as governments speedily rolled out booster campaigns. As some poorer countries struggle to get initial vaccine campaigns off the ground, Israel said citizens over the age of 60 and medical teams would be eligible for a fourth Covid vaccine shot.“The world will follow in our footsteps,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett tweeted.Across Africa, countries are lagging behind Western nations in getting populations inoculated as the continent faces fresh surges of it own.But in Nigeria, around a million AstraZeneca Covid doses donated by developed countries were destroyed Wednesday after they expired."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-approves-novavax-as-10th-authorized-covid-jab/,US health regulator authorizes Pfizer’s Covid pill as Omicron surges,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization on Tuesday approved a Covid vaccine made by US pharma giant Novavax for emergency use, after the European Union medicines regulator gave it the green light.The European Medicines Agency had assessed and approved Nuvaxovid on Monday.It is made from a more conventional technology than others already approved, which has led officials in Brussels to express hope that this will help persuade those hesitant about vaccination to come forward.The jab uses a traditional technology involving proteins found on coronavirus spike proteins that trigger an immune response.It is a tried and tested approach, used for decades to vaccinate people against diseases including hepatitis B and whooping cough.A so-called emergency use listing (EUL) by the WHO paves the way for countries worldwide to quickly approve and import a vaccine for distribution.It also opens the door for them to enter the Covax global vaccine-sharing scheme, set up to provide equitable access to doses around the world and particularly in poorer countries.The two-shot Nuvaxovid jab is the 10th Covid vaccine issued an EUL by the UN health agency. WHO said Nuvaxovid was around 90-percent effective at reducing symptomatic cases of Covid-19 in two major clinical studies, one in Britain and the other in the United States and Mexico, involving more than 45,000 people.In a separate document, WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation recommended the new vaccine for use in people over the age of 18, with an interval of three to four weeks between the two doses.“The vaccine should not be administered with an interval of less than three weeks,” it warned.It can be kept at refrigerated temperatures between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius, giving it a logistical advantage in difficult-to-access regions over the mRNA vaccines, which must be stored at ultra-low temperatures.Among the Covid vaccines already handed a WHO EUL is the Covovax shot, a version of Novavax’s vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India under licence from the US-based company.It was authorised on December 17.Also figuring on the list are the mRNA vaccines produced by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, Johnson&Johnson, AstraZeneca (which is counted twice for the versions made in Europe and in India), the Indian-made Covaxin and Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac.The WHO also recently resumed evaluating the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine against Covid-19, after several months in limbo, as it waited for additional data.Rogerio Gaspar, head of WHO’s regulation and prequalification department, said Monday that the UN health agency would begin assessing the quality of the data received next month and aimed to carry out inspections on-site in February.He told reporters he could provide “no date on approval because the approval will depends really … on the quality of the information.”Neither US nor EU medicines watchdogs have so far granted authorisation for Sputnik V, which has been used in Russia and some other countries since late 2020. ©"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/residents-revolt-against-uk-sewage-dumping/,WHO approves Novavax as 10th authorized Covid jab,1,"BRIGHTON, United Kingdom (AFP) – Brighton, on England’s south coast, has been described as Britain’s hippest city, and is a haven for tourists, especially Londoners keen to escape the capital.But surfer Stu Davies says the waters off Brighton and along the Channel coast are less attractive, describing them as an “open sewer”.Human faeces, wipes and tampons are regularly discharged into seas and rivers, angering local residents who are now taking action.“First hand I have surfed in raw sewage in this coast and city, and it’s disgusting,” Davies, a member of Surfers Against Sewage (SAS), told AFP on a seawall in the seaside resort.A short distance away, a storm overflow pipe stretches out across the beach towards the popular pier, before being slowly submerged by the rising tide.Similar structures dot the British coastline.“Suddenly you become aware of the smell, you can smell sewage, you can smell faeces and you can see faeces, and see bits of tissue and paper and other things that folk put down their toilets and enter into the sewage network,” Davies said of encountering waste while surfing.The water also takes on a “brownish” hue, he added.In very heavy rainfall, water companies are permitted to dump such waste to prevent sewers, many of which date back to the 19th century, from becoming clogged and flowing back into buildings.According to SAS, which campaigns for clean water, water companies reported more than 5,500 discharges in the year to the end of September — an 87.6-percent increase in one year.The association, which has developed an app to alert swimmers and surfers, points out that more and more discharges occur during “normal rainfall events”, not exceptional precipitation.It also believes that the figure largely underestimates the problem because it only refers to coastal waters.“This is clearly being used as a means of regular sewage disposal,” said SAS director Hugo Tagholm.The Environment Agency found that only 14 percent of English rivers were “environmentally satisfactory” in 2020.Christian Dunn, from the Department of Natural Sciences at Bangor University in Wales, warned of a “death potion” of sewage and agricultural and industrial waste that could wipe out aquatic life.Swimmers are also suffering from the presence of pathogens.Despite the grey December morning, Susan Moate still takes her daily dip into the cold murky water of the River Ouse, which flows through Lewes, and down to the sea at Brighton some 10 miles (16 kilometres) away.While the benefits to her mental health are enormous, the 38-year-old violin teacher is no longer willing to submerge her head after getting repeated ear infections.The doctor told her it was to be expected when swimming “in dirty water”.The same is true of Whitstable, a seaside resort on the Thames estuary, known for its oysters — and the Southern Water treatment plant.“I’ve been sick twice. Many local people are telling us they have been sick, or their dogs have been sick,” said Elane Heffernan, of the SOS Whitstable campaign group.From oyster farming to windsurfing, local businesses are also suffering from the pollution, she added.Southern Water was fined a record £90 million ($119 million, 106 million euros) in July after admitting nearly 7,000 illegal discharges into the sea and rivers between 2010 and 2015.These combined discharges lasted “a total of 61,704 hours, the equivalent of just over seven years”, the Environment Agency said.Some residents are even boycotting payment of their water bills — with the support of Boomtown Rats singer and Live Aid mastermind Bob Geldof, who lives in Faversham, inland from Whitstable.In response, Southern Water has said: “We know our performance has to improve and we are… spending £2 billion to cut pollution incidents by 80 percent by 2025.”The Environment Agency and the industry regulator announced in November they were investigating after companies admitted unauthorised discharges.Under strong public pressure, the government included in its new post-Brexit environment law an obligation for water companies to “significantly” reduce discharges from storm-water overflows.But SAS’s Tagholm said the government needs to go further and force water companies to invest much more in their infrastructure, with the objective of zero discharge into bathing waters by 2030.Since the privatisation of the water sector in 1989, he believes the companies have put “profits over people or the planet”.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/no-mountain-high-enough-study-finds-plastic-in-clean-air/,Residents revolt against UK sewage dumping,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) – From Mount Everest to the Mariana Trench, microplastics are everywhere – even high in the Earth’s troposphere where wind speeds allow them to travel vast distances, a study showed Tuesday.Microplastics are tiny fragments — measuring less than 5 millimetres — that come from packaging, clothing, vehicles and other sources and have been detected on land, in water and in the air.Scientists from the French national research institute CNRS sampled air 2,877 metres above sea level at the Pic du Midi Observatory in the French Pyrenees, a so-called “clean station” because of the limited influence exerted on it by the local climate and environment.There they tested 10,000 cubic metres of air per week between June and October of 2017 and found all samples contained microplastics.Using weather data they calculated the trajectories of different air masses preceding each sample and discovered sources as far away as North Africa and North America.The study’s main author Steve Allen of Dalhousie University in Canada told AFP that the particles were able to travel such distances because they were able to reach great altitudes.“Once it hits the troposphere, it’s like a superfast highway,” he said.The research also points to microplastic sources in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.“The marine source is the most interesting,” Allen said.“Plastic leaving the ocean into the air that high — it shows there is no eventual sink for this plastic,” he said.“It’s just moving around and around in an indefinite cycle.”While the amounts of miroplastics in the samples at the Pic du Midi don’t pose a health risk, study co-author Deonie Allen notes that the particles are small enough for humans to breathe in.And she says their presence in a zone thought to be protected and far from pollution sources should give pause.“It questions the relationship we have with plastic,” she said, adding that the problem is global.Allen said that it also shows that disposing of plastic by shipping it abroad is a flawed strategy.“It’s going to come back to you,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/human-cost-of-chinas-green-energy-rush-ahead-of-winter-olympics/,No mountain high enough: Study finds plastic in ‘clean’ air,1,"BAODING, China (AFP) – Beaten, forced off their land, cheated out of money, and even falsely imprisoned — farmers in China say they are paying a heavy price as authorities rush to deliver on ambitious pledges to ramp up national green energy output.China has vowed the upcoming Winter Olympics 2022 will be the first Games to be run entirely on wind and solar energy, and have built scores of facilities to increase capacity — but activists warn ordinary people are being exploited by “land grabs” in the process.In a hamlet near Beijing, the Long family — who say they’ve lost more than half their agricultural land to a sprawling solar farm next door — now have so little income they are burning corn husks and plastic bags to stay warm in winter.“We were promised just 1,000 yuan per mu of land each year when the power company leased the land for 25 years,” farmer Long from Huangjiao village said, using a Chinese unit of land equal to approximately 667 square metres.“We can make more than double the amount by growing corn in the same area. Now without land, I eke out a living as a day labourer.”China is the world’s biggest producer of wind turbines and solar panels, and the Winter Olympics is seen as an opportunity to showcase the country’s green technologies as they seek global markets.To ensure an uninterrupted power supply for the Games — and clear the winter smog choking the Chinese capital — Hebei province neighbouring Beijing has built a giant plant that takes in power from renewable projects in the province.That one plant creates 14 billion kilowatt hours of clean electricity every year, similar to the annual energy consumption of Slovenia.But for farmers like Long and his neighbour Pi, the green energy boom has made their lives more dangerous and difficult.Pi says villagers were forced to sign contracts — seen by AFP — leasing their land to the solar park built by State Power Investment Group (SPIC), one of the five biggest utility companies in the country.Those who didn’t agree were beaten by the police, he said, adding “some were hospitalised, some were detained.”Pi was jailed for 40 days, while Long languished in prison for nine months for “illegally gathering and disturbing peace,” after a public protest.“The situation is similar to a mafia,” Pi said. “If you complain, then you’ll be suppressed, imprisoned and sentenced.”The average annual disposable rural income in Baoding is about 16,800 yuan ($2,600), a figure both Long and Pi said they can no longer make.AFP could not confirm that electricity from the SPIC project near Huangjiao would be used to power the Olympic venues directly, because that information is not publicly available.The company declined to confirm when asked by AFP.But the Zhangjiakou government — the city co-hosting the Games — has said that since winning the Olympic bid in 2015, the area has “transformed itself from scratch (into) the largest non-hydro renewable energy base in China.”Government subsidies for wind and solar farms have also accelerated construction of such projects in other parts of Hebei, as China scrambles to cut air pollution before the Games.In a statement, Amnesty International said “forced evictions, illegal land seizures, and loss of livelihoods related to the loss of land” were among the most frequent human rights concerns associated with the wind and solar energy sectors.China wants 25 percent of its electricity to come from non-fossil fuels by 2030.To achieve this, the country has to more than double its current wind and solar capacity — but environmentalists warn land seizures will become more widespread as energy companies rush to produce renewables.And although Beijing has set a series of ambitious targets around the Winter Olympics, green campaigners face heavy pressure in China if they challenge the official line.Several told AFP they were not comfortable discussing Beijing’s environmental targets for the Games for fear of reprisals.In September, China announced strict rules for compensation when land is taken over for ecological projects, including the development of green energy.“Our land zoning (rules) also clearly regulate what agricultural land can’t be occupied, especially farmland,” Li Dan, secretary general of the renewable energy professionals committee, which promotes green development.“This is a red line.”If farmland is being used for renewable energy projects there should be a benefit sharing programme in place such as powering greenhouses, she said.But several farmers AFP spoke to said companies were labelling agricultural fields as wasteland to skirt the rules.Xu Wan, a farmer in Zhangjiakou, lost his land to a solar installation built during the run-up to the Games.“The company told us this was non-usable land, but actually it’s all very good agricultural land used by us farmers,” Xu said.“They said they would give us 3,000 yuan per mu of land. But in the end, we got nothing.”Zhangjiakou Yiyuan New Energy Development, which installed the solar project in Xu’s village, did not respond to AFP’s request for comment.Jiang Yi, a Chinese Academy of Engineering researcher, told a state-run industry news site that in future China will need 30,000-40,000 square kilometres more land to meet the renewable energy needs.“Where the land comes from has become the biggest issue restricting the development of the industry,” he said.Renewable investments also made up over half the new projects under China’s global infrastructure push — the Belt and Road initiative — last year.Priyanka Mogul from The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, a UK-based non-profit that has studied the impact of Chinese renewable investments abroad, said some developers had also been accused of controversial practices when acquiring land overseas.“The most prevalent issue was inadequate disclosure of environmental impact assessment (data)… followed by issues related to land rights and loss of livelihoods,” she said.To reduce conflicts when taking over village land, China has billed most solar farms as poverty alleviation projects, where villagers get free electricity from solar panels installed on their roofs.According to 2014 state guidelines, utility companies should then buy back the extra electricity in a programme to lift two million families out of poverty by 2020.The National Energy Administration said last year more than double that number benefited.But in Huangjiao with over 300 households, only two roofs had solar panels, and villagers said there had been no programme to install solar panels.“At a central level, the government has good policies for farmers,” Pi from Huangjiao village said.“But once it comes to the village level, things change. The corruption at the grassroots level is intolerable.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/eu-set-to-back-novavax-covid-vaccine/,Human cost of China’s green energy rush ahead of Winter Olympics,1,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AFP) — The EU’s drug regulator will decide Monday whether to approve a Covid jab by Novavax, which uses a more conventional technology that the US biotech firm hopes will reduce vaccine hesitancy.Novavax’s jab, a protein-based vaccine of the kind used around the world to protect against many childhood illnesses, would be the fifth coronavirus shot authorized for the European Union.Approval would also be a boost for the Maryland company, whose jab has been plagued by delays.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said its human medicines committee would hold an extraordinary meeting to decide on Novavax on Monday, and “will communicate the outcome”.The EU has already signed a deal to buy up to 200 million doses of the two-shot vaccine pending approval by the Amsterdam-based watchdog.Novavax says its vaccine showed 90.4 percent efficacy against Covid-19 in a North American trial.Chief executive Stanley Erck said the firm “looks forward to providing an additional vaccine option in Europe, built on a proven, well-understood technology platform”.The vaccine “may help address major obstacles to global vaccination, including global distribution challenges and vaccine hesitancy”, Erck added.All vaccines work by teaching the body’s immune system to attack the coronavirus, but they do it in different ways.Novavax’s so-called protein subunit technology is already tried and tested, having been used for decades to vaccinate people against diseases including hepatitis B and whooping cough.It also means it does not have to be stored in ultra-low temperatures, potentially giving it a logistical edge over some other jabs.Novavax uses tiny, lab-made fragments of a protein found on the surface of the coronavirus spike.When injected, these trigger a reaction by the immune system, so that if it later comes into contact with the Covid virus, it knows to attack it.By contrast, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have dominated the global Covid response using pioneering, but hitherto largely untested Messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.They use a molecule of genetic material known as RNA to deliver a message to cells to produce the spike protein themselves. The body’s immune system then learns to recognise the protein and attack it.The viral vector approach used by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson works on a similar principle, but delivers the genetic message via a version of the common cold adenovirus as a “vector”.Rare but serious side effects of heart inflammation have been reported with the mRNA vaccines, and blood clots with the viral vector vaccines.But Novavax has struggled with months of delays amid what a group of MEPs recently called “production problems”.Indonesia and the Philippines have already approved the Novavax jab, while Japan has agreed to buy 150 million doses.Novavax says it has also filed for approval in Britain, India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and with the World Health Organization.The company has also said it is “evaluating its vaccine against the Omicron variant” and working on an Omicron-specific version.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/tunisia-recyclers-struggle-to-tackle-mountains-of-waste/,EU set to back Novavax Covid vaccine,1,"MGHIRA, Tunisia (AFP) – “When I see plastic, I see money,” says Tarek Masmoudi, owner of one of the few recycling companies in Tunisia, where a waste crisis is threatening widespread social unrest.Recycling is almost non-existent in the North African country, which produces 2.6 million tonnes of waste each year.Some 85 percent of that ends up in landfills, while much of the rest winds up in informal dumps, says Tunisian waste management expert Walim Merdaci.But with many facilities close to overflowing and neighbouring communities up in arms, the crisis is already stoking tensions.In November, a man died as security forces fired tear gas to disperse protesters demanding the closure of a stinking landfill they say has spread deadly diseases and health problems to their town of Agareb, near second city Sfax.That could be a worrying sign of things to come as, according to expert Wassim Chaabane, most of the country’s 11 official dumping grounds are due to close by the end of 2022.That has authorities scrambling to find new sites.In the capital Tunis, home to about 2.7 million people, the situation is particularly urgent.The Bordj Chakir dump, Tunisia’s biggest, receives more than 3,000 tonnes of rubbish a day and is close to overflowing.But where others see a crisis, Masmoudi sees an opportunity.Every day, a steady stream of minivans and small trucks bring to his facility in Mghira, near Tunis, bales of plastic waste to be weighed, sorted and cut into fine chips for industrial use.Much is collected by hand from the streets and bins of the capital by “barbechas”, informal waste pickers.Masmoudi’s firm African Recycling deals with 6,000 tonnes of waste a year.The 42-year-old directly employs around 60 people, many of them women, and indirectly provides work to roughly 200 — no small achievement in a country suffering 18 percent unemployment.Between four and seven percent of Tunisia’s waste is recycled, according to official figures.But Masmoudi, standing by his sleek white four-wheel-drive, said the waste market was growing fast.“Recycling is a sector where a lot remains to be done, but which could create jobs and wealth in Tunisia.”The situation is similar in neighbouring Algeria, where experts say as much as 60 percent of household waste from the country’s 43 million population goes to unregulated dumps.Samira Hamidi, a member of Algeria’s semi-independent advisory body CNESE, says “less than seven percent of waste is recycled”.Just 5,000 people are employed in Algeria’s recycling sector, according to official figures.In Tunisia, after a decade of political paralysis since a 2011 revolution, Masmoudi says the waste management system reflects a lack of strategy and vision.Firms like his are blocked from collecting trash directly, as “municipalities own the rubbish”, he says.“The state pays 150-200 dinars ($52-$70) per tonne of waste that goes to landfill. We’re paying money to bury something that’s worth a fortune.”But implementing a system of sorting could take years, according to Chaabane.“Tunisia’s waste management system is hopeless at all levels, but especially when it comes to collection.”The national waste management agency recently admitted that it lacks the resources.Merdaci, the other expert, says Tunisian authorities want to bring in a combination of mechanical and biological methods to treat waste, compacting and composting it whilst collecting methane, gas which can be used as fuel.But initial projects will take two years to get off the ground.“Time is running out,” he says.Merdaci called for “a tax to pay for waste management and to make everyone pay for what they produce” as a means for municipalities to deal with waste.Each Tunisian produces on average 365 kilogrammes (804 pounds) of waste per year, yet taxpayers are charged no more than 28 cents for its management.Chaabane says urgent solutions are needed, and adds that incineration was “the best option for cities” if clean energy is used.But that option would not come cheaply, with incinerators costing some $280 million each.To Merdaci, the outlook is grim.“We’ve had 10 years of political instability, a decade without any decisions, problems with those living near dumps, and a lack of money. Success is nil.”© Agence France-Presse"

I work from six o’clock in the morning to 10 at night sometimes,” he says.Hans Engelke Energie supplies much of the coal used in the ovens across Berlin, and estimates between 5,000 to 6,000 homes still rely on the retro heat source.The family-run business is one of the last in Berlin still delivering briquettes of black coal to customers.It has had to diversify over recent years to survive, and now delivers home heating oil and wood pellets.“We sell gas and electricity, too,” says company co-head Peter Engelke, adding that the company “hopes to prosper for a long time”.Germany’s new government, which took office this month, has made the battle against climate change a priority, announcing a target to phase out the use of coal by 2030.Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition has pledged to expand renewable energy and decrease reliance on sources such as Russian gas in the long run.Some Berlin residents have already made the shift at home.Graphic designer Robert Schumann, who lives in the east of the city, still uses his ceramic stove to heat his home, but has dropped the coal in favour of wood.“It’s more ecological,” he says, drawing a comparison with fossil fuels excavated from the earth.“Less ash, and it’s a more sustainable energy source because trees grow back.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pfizer-to-test-third-vaccine-shot-for-under-fives/,Pfizer to test third vaccine shot for under-fives,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Pfizer announced Friday that it wants to test a third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in the under-fives, as the low dosage such small children can handle may not offer the same protection that older children enjoy from just two shots.The company does not expect the change to affect its plans to file for emergency use authorization in the United States in the first half of next year.As part of its ongoing clinical trials, the pharmaceutical giant has selected a dosage of three micrograms per injection for children aged six months to less than five years. This is 10 times less than the 30 microgram doses given to adults, and significantly less than the 10 micrograms given to five to 11 year olds.In children in the two to five year age group, a dosage of 10 micrograms caused more fever than in the older groups, pushing the company to select a lower dosage.But with two injections of three micrograms, their immune response was found to be poorer than in adolescents and young adults who were given the vaccine.Pfizer therefore decided to modify its clinical trials to include a third dose, injected “at least two months after the second,” the company said in a press release.The first two shots would remain three weeks apart.A booster dose has been shown in older population categories to increase protection against the virus.“This adjustment is not anticipated to meaningfully change our expectations that we would file for emergency use authorization and conditional approvals in the second quarter of 2022,” said Kathrin Jansen, Pfizer’s head of vaccine research.Pfizer also announced Friday that it had started trials on 600 teenagers aged 12 to 17 to test a booster dose of either 10 or 30 micrograms.Currently in the United States, in addition to adults, a booster dose is only permitted for adolescents aged 16 and 17 years."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/vast-study-confirms-rare-heart-risk-from-moderna-jab/,Vast study confirms rare heart risk from Moderna jab,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — The Moderna Covid jab carries a slight risk of usually non-serious heart problems a study of the entire population of Denmark found Friday.Incidences of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart) after mRNA jabs from Pfizer and Moderna had been noted in vaccine safety reports and small-scale studies.These reports led France, Denmark and other countries to advise against the jab for people under 30 years old.“Vaccination with mRNA-1273 (Moderna) was associated with a significantly increased rate of myocarditis or myopericarditis, especially among individuals aged 12-39 years,” the study said.It said that vaccination with Pfizer was only associated with an increased risk among women.The study published in the BMJ medical journal is the first to look at these side effects in an entire population.While it confirms the risks, it insists they are slight and that the risks posed by Covid infection are greater.It noted that among the vaccinated who developed myocarditis or pericarditis “only a few” had severe outcomes.In the case of the 21 people diagnosed with the conditions after receiving Moderna, over half were released from the hospital within 72 hours and none died or were diagnosed with heart failure.“Our finding of a low absolute risk of myocarditis or myopericarditis with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccination supports the overall benefits of such vaccination on an individual, societal, and global level,” the study concluded.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/europe-ramps-up-covid-vaccine-drive-for-children-as-omicron-rampages/,Europe ramps up Covid vaccine drive for children as Omicron rampages,1,"MADRID, Spain (AFP) — Europe stepped up vaccinations of children aged five to 11 against Covid-19 Wednesday, as the EU’s health agency warned immunization alone would not stop the rapid rise of the Omicron variant.Croatia, Germany, Greece, Hungary and Spain were among those opening up their inoculation drives to younger kids, with other nations still weighing their approach.South Africa — where Omicron was first detected — and Britain recorded their highest daily coronavirus case numbers Wednesday as Washington’s top diplomat curtailed a tour of Southeast Asia after a delegate caught the virus.At a hospital near Spain’s capital Madrid, nurses wearing Christmas antler headbands welcomed children and gave them stickers after their shots.“It only hurt a little,” said 11-year-old Magdalena Lazo Vitoria as she left the vaccination center, a plaster on her left shoulder.“I wasn’t nervous because I wanted to get vaccinated for a long time now, so I am really happy.”The rapid spread of the heavily mutated Omicron variant lent fresh urgency to the push, as EU chief Ursula von der Leyen warned the new strain could be dominant in Europe by mid-January.Even as children lined up to get jabs, the EU health agency ECDC said measures like mask-wearing, distance working and the prevention of crowds were essential to reduce the burden on healthcare systems in the time available, with vaccines alone taking too long.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he hoped his country, which already has one of Europe’s highest Covid-19 vaccination rates, would become an “example for the world” with its immunisation campaign for five to 11-year-olds.The country has around 3.3 million children in that age group.Doctors across Europe reported strong initial demand from parents.“As soon as we offered the vaccine appointments, they were pretty much all snapped up,” said Jakob Maske, a Berlin-based doctor and spokesman for Germany’s association of paediatricians.Germany’s STIKO vaccine commission has officially only recommended the jab for children with pre-existing conditions, but even healthy children will be inoculated if the parents request it.Some German cities plan to administer kids’ jabs in museums and zoos, while others are considering mobile vaccination teams outside schools.But like other countries, Germany also grapples with anti-vaccine militancy and Wednesday saw police in the eastern city of Dresden stage raids over death threats against Saxony state’s pro-vaccine premier Michael Kretschmer.While serious illness and death from Covid among children is rare, those infected can pass the virus to other people at higher risk of serious illness, such as the elderly.The EU’s medicines watchdog last month approved the lower-dosage Pfizer-BioNTech shot for five- to 11-year-olds, an age group experiencing high coronavirus infection rates across the continent.Denmark, which has seen a surge in cases attributed to the new Omicron variant, and some Austrian regions already began offering jabs to younger kids in November.The United States was the first large country to take the plunge and has so far vaccinated more than five million children in the 5-11 age bracket.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday cut short a visit to Thailand after a member of his delegation contracted coronavirus.Several European nations are tightening virus restrictions, with Poland imposing limits on the number of people allowed in restaurants, hotels and theatres.Britain on Wednesday registered 78,610 laboratory-confirmed cases, its highest total of the pandemic, a day after lawmakers approved stricter curbs in England amid estimates of 200,000 daily Omicron infections.The English Premier League also suffered more disruption as a coronavirus outbreak within Watford’s squad forced their match against Burnley to be postponed less than three hours before kick-off.Italy will from Thursday tighten restrictions for arrivals from the rest of the EU, requiring coronavirus tests for all travellers, while Greece announced a similar measure to come into effect from Sunday.A number of European countries will launch children’s vaccination drives in the coming days, including Italy, Portugal, Poland, the Baltic states and the Czech Republic, while others are still finalising their plans.In France, vaccination has only been approved for five to 11-year-olds at risk of developing serious illness, but the government has said it is considering extending it to all children on a voluntary basis.Belgium is awaiting the recommendation of its national health body, with a rollout likely around the new year.British regulators are still assessing whether to approve jabs for the 5-11 age group, with a decision likely before Christmas.Oil prices fell further amid fears of weakening demand caused by the spread of Omicron.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-sees-unprecedented-omicron-spread-probably-in-most-countries/,WHO sees unprecedented Omicron spread,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization warned Tuesday Omicron was spreading at an unprecedented rate and urged countries to act, as drug maker Pfizer said its coronavirus pill was effective against the variant.Dutch primary schools will close early as Europe battles a fresh wave of infections and hospital admissions, while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced a major parliamentary test seeking to impose fresh Covid curbs.Omicron, first detected by South Africa and reported to the WHO on November 24, has a large number of mutations, setting alarm bells ringing since its discovery.Early data suggests it can be resistant to vaccines and is more transmissible than the Delta variant, which was first identified in India and accounts for the bulk of the world’s coronavirus cases.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters the strain had been reported in 77 countries and “probably” spread to most nations undetected “at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant”.Omicron now accounts for around three percent of cases in the United States, a figure that is expected to rise rapidly as has been seen in other countries.The United States is the nation hit hardest by the pandemic, and it crossed 800,000 known Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker. Although Britain on Monday confirmed what is thought to be the world’s first Omicron death, there is no proof yet that the variant causes more severe illness.The WHO on Tuesday provided room for cautious optimism saying Africa had recorded a massive rise in cases over the past week but a lower number of deaths compared with previous waves.But it urged countries to act swiftly to rein in transmission, protect their health systems and guard against complacency.WHO expert Bruce Aylward strenuously warned against “jumping to a conclusion that this is a mild disease”.“We could be setting ourselves up for a very dangerous situation.”The warning came as Pfizer on Tuesday said clinical trials of its Covid pill reduced hospital admissions and deaths among at-risk people by almost 90 percent.The American drug maker said its new treatment, Paxlovid, held up against Omicron in lab testing.Chief executive Albert Bourla called the news a “game changer” and said he expected approval from the US medicines regulator as early as this month.“This news provides another potentially powerful tool in our fight against the virus, including the Omicron variant,” added US President Joe Biden.A real-world study from South Africa has showed two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 70 percent effective in stopping severe illness from Omicron.Researchers called the results encouraging, though it represented a drop compared with earlier strains, underlining the threat of the coronavirus.And the WHO added that low vaccination rates in regions including Africa — where Omicron was first detected — would provide breeding grounds for new variants of the virus, which has known to have claimed more than 5.3 million lives around the world. Europe is the global coronavirus hotspot, recording 62 percent of the world’s total cases in the past seven days, while the five countries with the world’s highest infection rates are all European.The Netherlands followed other European nations in reintroducing restrictions on Tuesday as Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced primary schools will shut next week and a night-time lockdown will be extended over Omicron fears.Schools will close from December 20 instead of on December 25 due to concerns that children, among whom infection rates are the highest, could pass it on to older relatives.France on Tuesday registered 63,405 new coronavirus cases — its highest daily total since April — even with more than 77 percent of its population having had at least one shot.In neighbouring Britain, the ruling Conservative government on Tuesday suffered a major parliamentary rebellion as almost 100 of its MPs rejected new restrictions as the country responds to Omicron.Boris Johnson’s administration will introduce new rules on mask-wearing, daily testing to avoid isolation and vaccine passes for certain settings in England.But many MPs from his own party believe the measures — which only passed with opposition support — are excessive and undermine basic freedoms.Scientists have predicted the true number already infected with Omicron in Britain could be as high as 200,000 a day, while the English Premier League reported a record caseload that threatened further disruption to fixtures."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/illegal-but-essential-migrants-recycle-istanbuls-waste/,‘probably’ in most countries,1,"ISTANBUL, Turkey (AFP) – Shrouded by acrid smoke, a young Afghan crouches sorting waste he has pulled from the trash bins of Istanbul, anxious that Turkey will soon strip him of even this subsistence.“I start at eight in the morning and finish at eight at night,” said Issam Raffur, who has spent four of his 20 years in Turkey.“It is very hard and poorly paid, but I have no choice,” he shrugged, smoke billowing from a fire barely warming his makeshift sorting centre on a soggy winter day.Considered the poorest of Turkey’s poor, Afghans have joined Kurds, the Laz, Roma and other ethnic minorities and undocumented migrants in doing work others snub.For less than $10 a day, they roam the streets of Istanbul, a megalopolis of nearly 16 million people straining under the weight of a currency crisis and a flood of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and other conflict-riven states.Diving headfirst into dumpsters, they dig up plastic bottles, glass and other waste they then sort and sell in bulk — a self-organised, unregulated business that keeps the city clean, and men such as Issam fed.But as public sentiment turns against migrants and other foreigners in Turkey, the state-appointed prefecture of Istanbul has declared this work bad for “the environment and public health”.Issam and his friends suspect that what Turkish officials really want is to put this potentially profitable business under the control of a few, well-connected recycling firms.“If the big companies take over, they will saw off our last branch of support,” said Mahmut Aytar, a Turk who manages one of the small recycling centres on the Asian side of Istanbul. “They will throw us in the ravine.”Speaking to AFP, Deputy Environment Minister Mehmet Emin Birpinar did little to ease Aytar’s concerns.“Waste can be bought and sold, so we have started to view it as a raw material with other uses,” he said. “After the price of raw materials increased, the value of recycled goods has risen.”Born in multi-ethnic southeastern Turkey, Aytar, 28, launched his recycling business out of desperation after failing to find work befitting his biology degree.“This job does not require experience or training. Anyone can do it, but it is mostly the people excluded by the system who get involved,” he said while watching his press machines crush plastic bags and empty bottles.After being shrunk into tidy bales, the plastic waste is loaded onto trucks of small, independently run recycling operators who convert them into granules.Aytar said he runs one of 2,500 or so impromptu recycling depots in Istanbul, receiving dozens of trash collectors — called “cekcekci” (pronounced “chekchekchi” and roughly translating as those who pull carts) — every day.Tugging white, muddied carts filled with paper, cardboard, plastic and bottles, they dart between honking cars and pedestrian streams, earning 80-120 liras ($6-$9) a day.Women and minors specialise in cardboard boxes, which they find after the shops close at night, their babies sometimes riding along in the carts’ lower folds.Each kilogramme (2.2 pounds) of waste is worth about a lira (seven US cents), and the bravest collect about 150 kilogrammes of waste a day.“They probably don’t realise it, but by being impoverished, they contribute to protecting the environment,” said Aytar. “They are helping society.”They do so while living in destitution and depend on the whims of the police.In early October, security forces rounded up more than 250 cekcekci in one day, releasing them after a few hours but keeping their precious cargoes of waste.“It’s harassment,” said Elrem Yasar, who started managing his own depot after collecting trash for 12 years.“Each confiscation costs me about 560 liras, which I earn in three days.”Istanbul prefecture officials defended their crackdown.“These cekcekci work illegally,” one official told AFP on condition of anonymity. “It is up to the city to take care of recycling and to collect revenues from it.”Conceding that his work has no legal status, collector Ekrem Yasar said he would be happy to pay taxes if ever given the chance.“We are not asking for state handouts, but if they take away our jobs, tens of thousands of people will be left with nothing,” he said, pinning his hopes on the first cekcekci union, which is still in the process of being set up.Most of the trash collectors and warehouse workers live on-site in crudely arranged containers, huddling around open fires in Istanbul’s industrial zones.“Imagine, life in the city,” Yasar said with a bitter laugh. “You think we are making money? Look, we only have one teaspoon between us,” he said while serving tea.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pfizer-says-covid-pill-drastically-reduces-severe-disease/,Illegal but essential,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Pfizer said Tuesday that clinical trials confirmed its Covid pill — a new type of treatment that should withstand the mutations seen with Omicron — drastically reduced hospitalizations and deaths among at-risk people by almost 90 percent.The announcement came as a real-world study from South Africa showed two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 70 percent effective in stopping severe illness from the new variant, a result called encouraging by researchers, though it represents a drop compared to earlier strains.Data for the new pill, which hasn’t yet been authorized anywhere in the world, came from more than 2,200 volunteers, and backed up preliminary findings announced last month.The American drugmaker said its treatment, called Paxlovid, also held up against the Omicron variant in lab-testing.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CBS News the drug was a “game changer,” and he expected the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to give its green light as soon as this month.The trial showed that the pill reduced the need for hospitalization in high-risk adults with Covid-19 by 89 percent if the treatment was given within three days of symptom onset and by 88 percent if given within five days.Overall, there were 12 deaths in the placebo group, and none in the drug group.Side-effects were found at comparable rates between the treatment and placebo groups (23 percent and 24 percent, respectively), and were mostly mild.Paxlovid also reduced the risk of severe disease, as well as the amount of virus detected, in a separate study of people at normal risk — but the results were on the edge of statistical significance and need further confirmation.Paxlovid is a combination of two drugs — nirmatrelvir, a new experimental medicine, and ritonavir, an existing antiviral used against HIV, both taken orally over five days.Nirmatrelvir is known as a “protease inhibitor” and works by blocking the action of an enzyme the coronavirus needs to replicate. Ritonavir is administered to slow down the breakdown of nirmatrelvir inside the body.Because Paxlovid does not target the fast-mutating spike proteins that stud the surface of the coronavirus, it should be more variant-proof than other treatments, such as synthetic antibody infusions, as well as antibodies evoked by most types of Covid vaccine.Another Covid pill, Merck’s molnupiravir, has already been authorized in Britain. A US panel of experts narrowly voted in favor of the Merck pill two weeks ago, but FDA authorization is still awaited.Final study results showed molnupiravir reduced hospitalizations and deaths by a relatively disappointing 30 percent, and there were also safety concerns related to its mechanism of action, which differs from the Pfizer pill.Merck itself recommended against molnupiravir’s use in pregnant women after animal studies showed harm to fetuses.The news comes as the heavily-mutated Omicron variant continues spreading fast around the world, raising alarms about surges in severe cases and deaths.Even if early data suggesting that the variant is milder in most people is confirmed, its increased transmissibility and ability to overcome prior immunity may negate this advantage, by infecting higher numbers of people.Many high-income countries have stepped up their campaigns to get people booster shots in order to restore vaccine efficacy.The latest research out of South Africa found that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine still offered good protection against serious illness of 70 percent, though this was reduced from 93 percent during the country’s Delta wave.The study was based on the results of 78,000 PCR tests taken in South Africa between November 15 and December 7 and was conducted by Discovery along with the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC).It also found two doses were 33 percent effective against infection — a result that lines up with early data from the UK Health Security Agency, which experts say underscores the case for a third dose.The British research found a third dose of Pfizer — either after two earlier doses of Pfizer or two of AstraZeneca — brought efficacy against infection back up to 70-75 percent.The South African research further confirmed reinfection risk is higher with Omicron, and a lower percentage of people infected with the new variant were hospitalized when compared to the country’s first wave, after adjusting for vaccine status.Very preliminary data suggests that children have a 20 percent higher risk of hospital admission with the new variant, but the absolute numbers remain very low.“It is essential to recognize that these are incomplete and partial data,” said Russell Viner, a professor of child and adolescent health at the University College London, though he also warned against complacency.© Agence France-Presse"

These antibodies help the immune system fight off the virus by targeting its spike protein, which allows it to enter cells and infect them.The FDA said that the treatment “may be effective for pre-exposure prevention for six months.”It cannot be administered to someone who is already infected with the virus, the FDA said, although AstraZeneca is testing it for such treatment.Side effects may include an allergic reaction, bleeding from the injection site, headache, and fatigue.The FDA authorization was based on a clinical trial carried out on unvaccinated people over 59 years of age, or with a chronic disease, or at high risk of infection.The drug was given to 3,500 people while 1,700 received a placebo. The trial showed that the treatment cut the risk of developing Covid-19 by 77 percent.Two cocktails of antibodies, made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly, are currently authorized for prevention of infection in the United States, but only in people who have been exposed to the virus shortly before, or who have a strong chance of being exposed, such as employees of retirement homes or prisons.In addition to being immunocompromised or unvaccinated, these people must also be at high risk of developing a severe case of the disease."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/pfizer-biontech-says-three-doses-effective-against-omicron/,US authorizes drug Evushield developed by AstraZeneca as Covid preventive treatment in some cases,1,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AFP) — Two doses of the BioNTech and Pfizer coronavirus vaccine may not be enough to protect against the Omicron strain, the companies warned Wednesday, but they stressed it was “still effective” after a third jab.The companies’ news was called reassuring by experts, and came as the first independent data from labs around the world emerged, suggesting that the new variant is better at evading vaccine-trained immunity than those before it.In preliminary results published on Wednesday, Pfizer and BioNTech said their vaccine “is still effective in preventing Covid-19, also against Omicron, if it has been administered three times”.But they warned that “the Omicron variant is probably not sufficiently neutralised after two doses.”According to early laboratory research using blood serum from vaccinated people, a booster third dose generated around the same level of antibodies against Omicron as is seen after a second dose with the initial strain.Blood samples from around 20 people who had received two doses of the current vaccine showed on average a 25-fold reduction in neutralising antibodies compared to the early strain of the virus, the companies said.But they added that another part of the immune response — from T cells — were probably still effective against the variant, adding that “vaccinated individuals may still be protected against severe forms of the disease”.Their results have not been peer reviewed.“We still need to be very measured and take a wait and see approach, but I think what we do have is at least encouraging,” Virologist Angela Rasmussen of Canada’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization told AFP.“Boosters will definitely be helpful in keeping the rate of Omicron breakthrough slower,” she added.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday summarized what is so far known about Omicron — it poses higher infection risks to people who have already had the virus or been vaccinated than previous variants, and there is a preliminary indication it could cause milder disease.But even if confirmed to be less severe, the variant is likely even more transmissible than Delta, meaning it could reach and thus sicken more people.Speaking at a press conference, BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said that reducing the time required between second and third doses of the vaccine was the “right way to go” to increase protection through the winter.The United Kingdom has begun giving booster shots to individuals at least three months after their second dose, while the delay to receive an additional shot is longer elsewhere.The vaccine-makers said that an Omicron-specific version of the jab, currently in development by BioNTech, would be ready for delivery by March, pending regulatory approval.The decision to switch production to the tailored vaccine would depend on Omicron’s spread.The announcement comes after other preliminary results from a small study in South Africa suggested there was up to a forty-fold drop in the ability of the antibodies from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to neutralise Omicron, compared to an earlier strain.The results suggest “that there is definitely much less neutralisation against Omicron compared to neutralisation against the original strains that came out of Wuhan initially,” said Willem Hanekom, executive director of the Africa Health Research Institute, which carried out the study.But he cautioned that it was important to be “extraordinarily careful” interpreting the results because they only reflect a laboratory setting, while real world data was the true test.Antibody reductions were also seen in a German study and one carried out in Sweden, but they varied in precise magnitude.Omicron counts more than 30 mutations on the spike protein that dots the surface of the coronavirus and allows it to invade cells, and a high degree of immune evasion was widely anticipated.But Rasmussen said she was encouraged by a finding in the South African research that showed the Omicron variant used the same “receptor” — known as ACE2 — to enter cells, as opposed to mutating in a more fundamental way.The detection of the first Omicron cases two weeks ago coincided with soaring infection numbers across the world, and the variant added fuel to concerns about a global Covid resurgence.Dozens of nations have re-imposed border restrictions in response to the spread of the new virus variant and raised the possibility of a return of economically punishing lockdowns."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/in-no-circumstances-is-forced-vaccination-ok-un-rights-chief/,US authorizes AstraZeneca Covid treatment in some cases,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — Countries considering introducing vaccine mandates in the fight against Covid-19 must ensure they respect human rights, the UN rights chief said Wednesday, stressing that forced vaccination was never acceptable.Speaking to a Human Rights Council seminar via video message, Michelle Bachelet warned there were significant rights considerations that needed to be taken into account before making vaccination compulsory.Any “vaccine mandates must comply with the principles of legality, necessity, proportionality and non-discrimination”, she said, according to a transcript.“In no circumstances should people be forcibly administered a vaccine.”The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said the aims sought by countries mulling mandates to protect lives as Europe and other regions battle fierce surges in the pandemic, were “of course of the highest order of legitimacy and importance”.But she insisted that “vaccine mandates should be employed only when necessary for achieving compelling public health ends”.“And they should only be considered when less intrusive measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing have demonstrably failed to meet such health needs.”She also emphasised that for any mandate to be acceptable, countries needed to ensure that vaccines are truly available and affordable.“Unless all people have genuine, practical access to vaccines, vaccine requirements will not be consistent with fundamental human rights principles of equality and non-discrimination,” she said.Bachelet also highlighted that “the actual vaccines employed must also be sufficiently safe and effective to achieve (the) public health aims.”Any mandatory vaccination regime also must be flexible enough to allow for “appropriate exceptions, such as where a vaccination is medically contra-indicated for an individual.”Bachelet said it could be appropriate to restrict some rights and liberties, including conditioning access to schools, hospitals or other public spaces on vaccination.But forced injections was never acceptable, she said, “even if a person’s refusal to comply with a mandatory vaccination policy may entail other legal consequences, including, for example, appropriate fines”.“Where penalties are imposed, they should be proportionate and subject to review by judicial authorities,” she said.There needed to be “appropriate procedural safeguards, including the right to seek a justified exemption and the right to appeal any form of penalty before a fair and independent authority,” she insisted.Looking forward, the UN rights chief said any vaccine mandates introduced “should be subject to frequent official review to ensure they remain necessary, proportionate and non-discriminatory.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/highly-unlikely-existing-vaccines-will-fail-against-omicron-who/,‘Highly unlikely’ existing vaccines will fail against Omicron: WHO,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — Omicron does not appear to cause more severe disease than previous Covid variants, and is “highly unlikely” to fully dodge vaccine protections, a top WHO official told AFP Tuesday.Speaking to AFP, the World Health Organization’s second-in-command, said that while a lot remained to be learned about the new, heavily mutated variant of Covid-19, preliminary data indicated it did not make people sicker than Delta and other strains.“The preliminary data doesn’t indicate that this is more severe. In fact, if anything, the direction is towards less severity,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said in an interview, insisting though that more research was needed.“It’s very early days, we have to be very careful how we interpret that signal.”At the same time, he said there was no sign that Omicron could fully sidestep protections provided by existing Covid vaccines.“We have highly effective vaccines that have proved effective against all the variants so far, in terms of severe disease and hospitalisation,” the 56-year-old epidemiologist and former trauma surgeon said.“There’s no reason to expect that it wouldn’t be so” for Omicron, he said, pointing to early data from South Africa where the variant was first detected that “suggest the vaccine at least is holding up in protection terms”. Ryan acknowledged it was possible that the existing vaccines might prove less effective against Omicron, which counts more than 30 mutations on the spike protein that dots the surface of the coronavirus and allows it to invade cells.But he said it was “highly unlikely” it would be able to evade vaccine protections altogether.“We have to confirm if there’s any lapse in that protection, but I would expect to see some protection there.“The preliminary data from South Africa wouldn’t indicate that we will have a catastrophic loss of efficacy. In fact, the opposite at the moment.”In the fight against all Covid variants, he said, “the best weapon we have right now is to get vaccinated.”Two weeks after first being identified, Omicron has been found in dozens of countries around the world.Early data from South Africa indicates that the new variant is likely more transmissible than previous variants, Ryan said, adding that this was not a surprise.“When any new variant emerges, it will tend to be more transmissible, because it’s got to compete with previous variants,” he said. The fast-talking Irishman said one could expect Omicron to gradually replace Delta as the dominant strain.But he pointed out that Omicron had so far been seen spreading especially quickly in South Africa, where Delta had waned, and may just be “exploiting a gap in the transmission of Delta”.There are also indications that Omicron is better at infecting people who have been vaccinated or already had Covid.“There is some evidence to suggest that reinfection with Omicron is more common than it was with previous waves or previous variants,” Ryan said.But “we’re particularly interested in seeing not whether you can be reinfected with Omicron, but whether any new infection is more or less severe.”He said that, as the current Covid vaccines aim to prevent severe disease but do not necessarily protect against simply contracting the virus, reinfections with mild or no symptoms were of lesser concern.In any case, Ryan said, despite its mutations, the new variant was still Covid, and should be fought with the same measures, including vaccines, masks and physical distancing.“The virus hasn’t changed its nature. It may have changed in terms of its efficiency, but it hasn’t changed the game entirely,” he said.“The rules of the game are still the same.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/top-who-us-scientists-say-omicron-no-worse-than-other-virus-variants/,Top WHO,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The Omicron variant appears to be no worse than other coronavirus strains, top scientists from the WHO and the United States told AFP, while cautioning that more research is needed to judge its severity.The hopeful assessments came as global concern grew over the heavily mutated variant, which has forced dozens of nations to re-impose border restrictions and raised the possibility of a return of economically punishing lockdowns.While it is likely more transmissible than previous variants, Omicron is also “highly unlikely” to completely evade vaccine protections, the World Health Organization’s second-in-command told AFP on Tuesday.“The preliminary data doesn’t indicate that this is more severe. In fact, if anything, the direction is towards less severity,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said in an interview, insisting though that more research was needed.Ryan also said there was no sign that Omicron could fully sidestep protections provided by existing Covid vaccines.“We have highly effective vaccines that have proved effective against all the variants so far, in terms of severe disease and hospitalisation… There’s no reason to expect that it wouldn’t be so” for Omicron, he added, pointing to initial data from South Africa, where the strain was first reported.However, Ryan acknowledged that it was possible that existing vaccines might prove less effective against Omicron, which counts more than 30 mutations on the spike protein that dots the surface of the coronavirus and allows it to invade cells.Top US scientist Anthony Fauci echoed the WHO’s view, saying Omicron did not appear worse than prior strains based on early indications — and was possibly milder.The new variant is “clearly highly transmissible,” very likely more so than Delta, the current dominant global strain, Fauci told AFP.“It almost certainly is not more severe than Delta,” he added. “There is some suggestion that it might even be less severe.”But he noted it was important to not over-interpret this data because the populations being followed skewed young and were less likely to become hospitalised. Severe disease can also take weeks to develop.“Then as we get more infections throughout the rest of the world, it might take longer to see what’s the level of severity.”The detection of the first Omicron cases last month coincided with surges in infection numbers across the world, and the variant added fuel to concerns about a global Covid resurgence.As European Union health ministers met Tuesday to find ways to coordinate their response, Norway announced it will tighten restrictions to combat its surge.It followed a suspected outbreak of Omicron last week among dozens of partygoers who had all been vaccinated led to new restrictions in and around the capital Oslo.Neighbouring Sweden also said Tuesday it would launch a series of anti-Covid measures.Elsewhere in Europe, Poland said from December 15, it will restrict the number of people allowed in churches, restaurants and theatres, and make vaccination compulsory for healthcare workers, teachers and the military from March 1.While the positive initial assessments of Omicron helped lift the mood, especially among global markets as fears of another economic downturn subsided, the variant’s emergence has highlighted that the fight against the pandemic is far from over.Covid-19 has killed more than 5.2 million people around the world since the coronavirus was first declared in late 2019, with scientists and health experts saying vaccinations and continued social distancing are keys to defeating the disease.But vaccine requirements have led to resistance in many countries, either because of misinformation and conspiracy theories or the economic and logistical impact of such mandates.Around 4,000 people protested in Brussels on Tuesday against a plan by the Belgian government to make vaccines compulsory for health workers from early next year.“We are in favour of vaccination, but why only health workers?” said nurse Perrine.“Because everyone must be vaccinated, it is everyone or no one.”© Agence France-Presse"

In fact, 2020 marked the steepest increase in global billionaires’ share of wealth on record,” the document said.The club of the richest one percent has taken more than a third of all additional wealth accumulated since 1995, while the bottom 50 percent captured just two percent.“After more than 18 months of Covid-19, the world is even more polarised,” Lucas Chancel, co-director of the World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics, told AFP.“While the wealth of billionaires rose by more than 3.6 trillion euros ($4 trillion), 100 million more people joined the ranks of extreme poverty,” said Chancel, noting that extreme poverty had been previously falling for 25 years.A real-time ranking by Forbes magazine shows that the top 10 richest people each have a net worth exceeding $100 billion, with Tesla boss Elon Musk on top with $264.5 billion.Only one of the men is not American — LVMH luxury group chief Bernard Arnault — and all but two are tech industry leaders whose fortunes have been turbocharged by soaring company share prices.The 228-page report, whose contributors include French economist Thomas Piketty, calls for a “modest progressive wealth tax on global multimillionaires” in order to redistribute wealth, along with measures to prevent tax evasion.“Given the large volume of wealth concentration, modest progressive taxes can generate significant revenues for governments,” the report said.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-disruptions-caused-surge-in-malaria-deaths-who/,‘Encouraging’ early feedback on Omicron case severity: Fauci,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — Pandemic-related disruptions caused tens of thousands more malaria deaths in 2020, the World Health Organization said Monday, but added that urgent action had averted a far worse scenario.In a fresh report, the UN health agency found that Covid-19 had reversed progress against the mosquito-borne disease, which was already plateauing before the pandemic struck.There were an estimated 241 million malaria cases worldwide in 2020 — 14 million more than a year earlier — and the once-rapidly-falling death toll swelled to 627,000 last year, jumping 69,000 from 2019.I linked approximately two thirds of those additional deaths to disruptions in the provision of malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment during the pandemic, the WHO said.But it stressed that the situation “could have been far worse”.The UN agency pointed to its projection early in the pandemic that the service disruptions could cause malaria deaths to double in 2020.“Thanks to the hard work of public health agencies in malaria-affected countries, the worst projections of Covid’s impact have not come to pass,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.“Now, we need to harness that same energy and commitment to reverse the setbacks caused by the pandemic and step up the pace of progress against this disease.”Since the turn of the century, the world has made steady progress against malaria, with annual cases falling 27 percent by 2017 and deaths plunging by over 50 percent.But the numbers stalled in the years prior to the pandemic.And the situation worsened in sub-Saharan Africa, where 95 percent of all malaria cases and 96 percent of all deaths occur, and where around 80 percent of all deaths are among children under five.The WHO report showed that 24 countries had registered increased malaria deaths since 2015 — the baseline year for the agency’s global malaria strategy.In the 11 countries with the highest malaria burden worldwide, cases swelled from 150 million in 2015 to 163 million in 2020, while deaths grew from 39,000 to 444,600 over the same period, it said.“I think we are on the verge of a potential malaria crisis,” Dr Pedro Alonso, head of WHO’s Global Malaria Programme, told reporters.Not only are we not getting closer to elimination or eradication globally, he warned, “but the problem (is) becoming worse in a substantial number of parts of Africa.”But a number of countries are making progress.Between 2000 and 2020, 23 countries managed to go three consecutive years with no local transmission, and so far in 2021, China and El Salvador were certified malaria-free.Another positive step is the development of the first malaria vaccine.Last week, the global vaccine alliance, Gavi, said it had approved nearly $156 million in funding to roll out the jabs to children in sub-Saharan Africa.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/sealand-the-micronation-defying-the-uk-and-covid/,Covid disruptions caused surge in malaria deaths: WHO,1,"SEALAND (AFP) – It’s a hulking metal-and-concrete platform in the North Sea that has been run as an independent micronation in defiance of the UK government for the last 54 years.But even on Sealand, some seven miles (11 kilometres) off the coast of southeast England, visitors have to show a negative Covid-19 test before being winched up onto the deck.“We have zero Covid cases,” Liam Bates, one of the self-declared “princes” of Sealand, declares proudly.“At the moment I think we’re one of the only countries in the world that can actually say that,” he told AFP.Sealand, a former anti-aircraft platform built atop two hollow concrete towers, had been due to be demolished after World War II since it was outside UK waters.But when that did not happen, Bates’ grandfather, Roy, a businessman with ventures in fishing and pirate radio, took over and declared independence.The Principality of Sealand — motto “E Mare Libertas” (From the Sea, Freedom) — was born in 1967, with its own constitution, a national flag and even a national anthem.Since then the windswept former fortification has survived an attempted “coup”, a collapsed data storage venture and a catastrophic fire.With its black-red-and-white flag flying, Sealand still has a piratical air.Engineer Joe Hamill, 58, winches up visitors in a wooden swing, as they tightly grip the ropes.On board, the first formality is a Sealand passport stamp.Close up, Sealand looks reassuringly shipshape with new decking and neatly stored tools, paints and tins of hot dogs.The kitchen has pot plants and china plates while the rooms are decorated with wallpaper, rugs and classic books, including Thomas Hardy’s “Far From the Madding Crowd.”Liam, now 33, has been visiting since he was three and springs onto the swing seat with practised ease.He focuses on the day-to-day operations, while his elder brother, James, runs the family’s cockle fishing and canning business.Their father, Prince Michael, is recovering from surgery and “slowing down a bit,” he says.Since he has an American fiancee and an elder brother, Liam jokes that he is Sealand’s “Prince Harry”.Sealand keeps afloat by selling titles through its website: you can become a Lord of Sealand for £29.99 ($44.99) or a Duke for £499.99.They sell “a good few”, said Liam. “Enough to sustain Sealand now, which is just massive.”Sealand does not pay UK tax and the “whole point… is freedom of whatever you want, really: like religion, expression, any kind of orientations,” he added.While the Bates only visit, the platform is maintained by two men on two-week shifts: Hamill and 66-year-old Michael Barrington, head of homeland security.During lockdown, Hamill said he volunteered to spend two 11-week periods here on his own, winching up supplies from a boat.By the end, “I think my mental state was actually going a bit”, says the Londoner, who used to work in insurance. “It was pure isolation.”At least Sealand is far more comfortable than in its early days, the men say.Wind turbines and solar panels have replaced the old diesel generators, one of which caught fire in 2012, causing extensive damage.Rooms inside the concrete towers include a multi-faith chapel, a recreation room with a pool table and gym equipment and a meeting room with a whiteboard.Some are below the waterline and there is a constant sound of sloshing water.Barrington, who first came to Sealand 33 years ago after working on pirate radio stations, calls it “a big man cave”.There’s little trace of Sealand’s WWII origins, beyond a painted sign about pumps.Liam Bates said that most got ripped out in the early 2000s, when US entrepreneurs tried to set up a data haven in the towers.It became “a victim of the dot.com bubble,” he says, while servers remain in one room “as part of our national history”.He still sees the future of Sealand as digital, with plans to launch a cryptocurrency, though he gives few details.A small prison cell with an iron bedstead once housed the state’s only prisoner in 1978 during “the great coup of Sealand”.After a dispute with Roy Bates, a German businessman sent mercenaries to storm the platform while he was away.Roy Bates and his son Michael recaptured Sealand in a dawn raid in a helicopter and released the mercenaries but held the businessman’s lawyer, accusing him of treason.He was eventually freed after a German diplomat came out to investigate.This is not the only violent episode in Sealand history: in 1967 the Bates fought off a boarding party from Radio Caroline, a popular pirate radio station, throwing down Molotov cocktails.In 1968 Roy and his son Michael were tried for weapons offences after firing on passing ships, but the court ruled the fort was outside British jurisdiction.“My dad (Michael) taught us to fire guns and all that sort of stuff,” says Liam, who is cagey about whether there are weapons on board now.“We’re equipped to protect ourselves because obviously we’ve been attacked in the past,” he says.Since 1987, the platform has been legally in British waters, although the UK is not actively trying to claim it back.“I think they like to pretend we don’t exist, and just hope that one day we’ll pack up and leave,” said Liam.“Which of course is never going to happen”.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/taiwan-rushes-to-contain-sudden-cane-toad-invasion/,Sealand: the ‘micronation’ defying the UK and Covid,1,", Toads are a symbol of prosperity and good fortune in Taiwan, but the unexpected discovery of an invasive species has officials and environmentalists scrambling to contain their spread.With flashlights in hand and shielded by protective gloves, dozens of volunteers from the Taiwan Amphibian Conservation Society worked through the night searching rice fields and vegetable plots for their quarry — the cane toad.There should be no reason for these large and highly toxic amphibians to exist in Chaotun, a township in the foothills of Taiwan’s central mountain range.Cane toads are indigenous to South and Central America and while they have wrought a famously destructive path through places like Australia and the Philippines they had not been recorded in Taiwan.That was until a few weeks ago when a local resident discovered some large amphibians hanging out in her community vegetable garden and uploaded a photograph online, a move that sparked an immediate toadhunt.“A speedy and massive search operation is crucial when cane toads are first discovered,” Lin Chun-fu, an amphibian scientist at the government-run Endemic Species Research Institute told AFP as he explained why conservationists have since rushed to find and remove any cane toads.“Their size is very big and they have no natural enemies here in Taiwan,” he added.Soon after the photo was uploaded Yang Yi-ju, an expert at National Dong Hwa University, sent a group of volunteers from the Amphibian Conservation Society to investigate.They arrived at the vegetable garden and were shocked to find 27 toads in the immediate vicinity.She quickly identified the interlopers as rhinella marina thanks to the tell-tale large partoid glands behind the ears where cane toads secrete a dangerous poison.“I was shocked and worried when they found more than 20. This is not going to be an easy thing to tackle,” she recalled.“We began to notify and mobilise everyone to act,” she said, adding the presence of juveniles showed the toads were breeding.Cane toads are a dangerous invasive species for three key reasons.They are voracious predators, they are hugely successful at breeding and they are poisonous. That latter quality, a defence mechanism, is especially dangerous to dogs who might lick or bite one.Local farmers told conservationists they had noticed the arrival of these burly toads but never reported it.“Taiwanese farmers generally ignore toads and even look favorably at toads when they find them because they help rid the land of pests and are also a good luck symbol,” explained Yang.“It never occurred to them that this is an invasive species from a foreign land.”Conservation officials and environmental volunteers have been working non-stop to do a painstaking search.“We have divided (the township) into 200 by 200 meters square grids to investigate one by one if there are marine toads present,” field researcher Lin Yong-lun said, pointing to a series of colour-coded maps.The search perimeter has since been expanded to a 4-kilometer radius.So far more than 200 marine toads of various sizes have been captured and housed at the Endemic Species Research Institute.Cane toads are among the world’s ‘100 Invasive Alien Species’ list compiled by the Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG), an international advisory body of scientists and policy experts.Also known as marine toads, their most common English name came from the fact that it was used in sugar plantations to hunt cane beetles.They were introduced into plantations in Australia, the Philippines, Japan, the Caribbean as well as Florida and Hawaii where they have caused damage to the local ecosystems.Despite their warty appearance, toads are a symbol of wealth, longevity and good luck in Chinese culture. They are also used in Chinese medicine and their totems are common in feng shui to ward off bad luck.“In store fronts you can find toad totems, drawings and even real live toads. It’s a symbol of fortune and good luck,” amphibian scientist Lin said.Until 2016 it was legal to import cane toads into Taiwan as pets where they can fetch between NT$3000 to NT$4000 ( US$107-US$142).Conservationists believe since imports were banned, people have started breeding cane toads locally and some have since escaped or abandoned by their masters.So far there have been no other reported sightings in Taiwan and Yang is cautiously optimistic about stopping the spread.“Next spring during mating season is when we truly know for sure if we have contained it,” she said.© Agence France-Presse"

All incoming travellers will need to test negative within a day of their flights, and rapid tests that cost $25 will be covered by insurance and distributed free to the uninsured.Australia on Friday reported three students in Sydney had tested positive for the variant, despite a ban on non-citizens entering the country and restrictions on flights from southern Africa, with multiple countries rushing to limit travel from the region in the past week.“It’s quite a kick in the nuts,” said Sabine Stam, who runs a South African tour company and whose customers are demanding refunds. “Everyone is too scared to set a new travel date,” she said.In Norway, officials said at least 13 people who contracted Covid-19 after an office party in Oslo last week had the Omicron variant — though so far they have only had mild symptoms, city health official Tine Ravlo told AFP.But the government ushered in restrictions in greater Oslo after fears of the cluster surfaced.On Friday, Malaysia also reported a first Omicron infection in a foreign student arriving from South Africa on November 19. Sri Lanka also announced its first case, a citizen returning from South Africa.Russia’s federal statistics agency Rosstat, meanwhile, said that nearly 75,000 people died of coronavirus in the country in October, making it the deadliest month of the pandemic. The new variant poses a major challenge to ending the pandemic.Rising Delta cases had already forced European governments to reintroduce mandatory mask-wearing, social distancing, curfews or lockdowns, leaving businesses fearing another grim holiday.Belgian authorities said on Friday that primary schools would close a week early for the December holidays.Germany’s regional leaders agreed new measures including a ban on fireworks at new year parties to discourage large gatherings.Ireland said it will close nightclubs and reintroduce social distancing in some settings until the New Year.In the UK, ministers have been expressing divergent opinions, not only on the idea of hosting parties, but also on the kind of conduct deemed acceptable."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/reinfections-three-times-more-likely-with-omicron-s-african-research/,WHO says no Omicron deaths yet,1,"JOHHANESBURG, South Africa (AFP) — A preliminary study by South African scientists published Thursday suggests the Omicron variant is three times more likely to cause reinfections compared to the Delta or Beta strains.The findings, based on data collected by the country’s health system, provides the first epidemiological evidence about Omicron’s ability to evade immunity from prior infection.The paper was uploaded on a medical preprint server and has not yet been peer-reviewed.There were 35,670 suspected reinfections among 2.8 million individuals with positive tests until November 27. Cases were considered reinfections if they tested positive 90 days apart.“Recent reinfections have occurred in individuals whose primary infections occurred across all three waves, with the most having their primary infection in the Delta wave,” tweeted Juliet Pulliam, director of the South African DSI-NRF Centre of Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis.Pulliam cautioned that the authors did not have information about the individuals’ vaccination status and therefore could not assess to what extent Omicron evades vaccine-induced immunity. The researchers plan to study this next.“Data are also urgently needed on disease severity associated with Omicron infection, including in individuals with a history of prior infection,” she said.Michael Head, a scientist at the University of Southampton, praised the research as “high quality.”“This analysis does look very concerning, with immunity from previous infections being relatively easily bypassed. Might this all still be a ‘false alarm’? That is looking less and less likely,” he said in a statement.Earlier, top South African scientist Anne von Gottberg, an expert at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, forecast a surge in cases but said authorities expected vaccines would still be effective against severe outcomes.“We believe the number of cases will increase exponentially in all provinces of the country,” she said in a news conference with the World Health Organization’s Africa region.“We believe that vaccines will still however protect against severe disease,” she added.“Vaccines have always held out to protect against serious disease, hospitalisations and death.”WHO experts reiterated calls for a rethink on travel bans against southern Africa, given that Omicron had now been reported in nearly two dozen countries and its source remained unclear.“South Africa and Botswana detected the variant. We don’t know where the origin of this could have been,” said specialist Ambrose Talisuna. “To punish people who are just detecting or reporting… is unfair.”In mid-November, South Africa was reporting about 300 cases a day. On Wednesday the country reported 8,561 new cases, up from 4,373 the day before and 2,273 on Monday.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/purity-or-power-indias-coal-quandary/,as variant spreads worldwide; 38 countries detect variant,1,", Thick grey dust hangs in the air and vast chasms are gouged into the land in the Indian coal hub of Singrauli, where giant machines scoop up dirty fuel to power the country’s growth while worsening its pollution blight.The open-cast mines of Singrauli epitomise the economic and environmental dilemma faced by the world’s second-most populous nation, which led the opposition to phasing out coal at this month’s COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.India’s resistance on the issue is driven by its desire to distribute the benefits of development more widely among its 1.3 billion people, some of whom still have no access to electricity.But it comes at a heavy price.In Singrauli, home to more than a dozen mines and coal-fired power stations, dark soot covers trees, houses, cars and even cows.In scenes reminiscent of a dystopian movie, sticky sludge lines the roads, while trucks, trains and ropeway cars carry huge mounds of coal and spill black dust on passers-by.Residents have little choice but to breathe in the acrid air that stings the eyes and throats.“Our air, water and in fact the entire environment is heavily polluted. Even the cows look like buffaloes here,” said Sanjay Namdev, a labour union activist, as cranes and dumpers whirred behind him at a sprawling coal yard.“But forget phasing out, you cannot even phase down coal in a country like India,” he told AFP. “Millions of people depend on coal for cheap electricity and I don’t see that stopping ever.”As Asia’s third-biggest economy grows, its hunger for coal is mounting, with aspirational middle classes needing electricity to run their air conditioners and refrigerators.Coal consumption in India has already doubled in the last decade — only China burns more — and the fuel powers 70 percent of the country’s electricity grid.With international pressure mounting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month announced India would aim to be carbon-neutral only by 2070 — a decade after China and 20 years after the world’s other big emitters.The government argues that although the country is the world’s third-largest emitter in total, its per capita emissions are far lower than the American average.Around 30,000 people are employed in the Singrauli mines, with thousands more working as casual labourers, and fear they have no future without coal, even as climate change brings them hotter summers and heavy unseasonal rains.“You can see how bad the pollution situation is here. I know it is bad for my health but what will I do if the coal mines shut down? How will I feed my children?” said mineworker Vinod Kumar, whose haggard looks belied his 31 years.Northern Coalfields, a state-run mining firm, owns over 80 percent of the coal assets in Singrauli, producing 130 million tonnes of the fuel annually, and says it is trying to make its operations less polluting.“We want to make coal dispatch completely eco-friendly,” said company spokesman Ram Vijay Singh. “We also hold free camps every year to screen health problems among the locals.”But activists say such piecemeal measures serve no real purpose.“There are some machines and techniques that can cut down the pollution but the companies are not serious about these,” said Namdev.“There are so many anti-pollution guidelines but these are flouted with impunity. All they are concerned about is making quick profits.”Across India, more than 13 million people are employed in coal mining and related sectors, according to Harjeet Singh of the Fossil Fuel Non-proliferation Treaty Initiative, a campaign group.“An abrupt coal phase-out in India may lead to economic disruption,” he said. “In a country where a large population depends on coal for their income and energy, we must ensure social justice in the shift towards a fossil fuel-free future.”And for some Singrauli residents, their biggest complaint is that they are not profiting from the environmental carnage around them.Casual labourer and part-time liquor distiller Uma Devi, 50, lives in a thatched mud house on the edge of a coal mine owned by Reliance, an Indian conglomerate headed by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani.“We have been begging them to give us jobs for two years but they don’t listen to us,” she said. “They have brought people from outside to work for them.“Each time blasting happens, it shatters our eardrums.

African research,1,"(Eagle News) — The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) asked member states and countries to beat and end the COVID-19 pandemic by fully vaccinating at least 40 percent of their population by year-end and 70 percent by the middle of next year.WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that it is also important to negotiate a WHO convention or accord that would serve as an international instrument “on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.”This call came about as the COVID-19’s newest variant, Omicron, was found it at least 24 countries.Omicron was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on November 24, while the first known laboratory-confirmed case was identified from a specimen collected on November 9.The Netherlands said Tuesday it had found the variant in two samples taken on November 19 and 23, one having recently been to southern Africa and the other having no travel history.On Wednesday, the United States reported its first Omicron variant case from a traveler who came from South AfricaHere are the countries that have so far reported Omicron variant cases:Australia – 7 cases Austria – 1 case Belgium – 1 case Botswana – 19 cases Brazil – 2cases Canada – 6 cases Czech Republic – 1 case Denmark – 4 cases France – 1 case on Reunion Island Germany – 9 cases Hong Kong – 4 cases Israel – 4 cases Italy – 9 cases Japan – 2 cases Netherlands – 16 cases Nigeria – 3 cases Norway – 2 cases Portugal – 13 cases Saudi Arabia – 1 case South Africa – 77 cases Spain – 2 cases Sweden – 3 cases United Kingdom – 22 cases United States – 1 case Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s Covid-19 technical lead, said timelines around first detections of Omicron may change as there was a backlog of sequencing of cases that occurred in November.Tedros said the WHO was taking the emergence of Omicron “extremely seriously”, but added that the mutation “should not surprise us. This is what viruses do.“And it’s what this virus will continue to do, as we long as we allow it to continue spreading.”Tedros said Omicron was in at least 23 countries — with that number expected to grow. He made the announcement before the US bared that it had found an Omicron variant case.Van Kerkhove said the WHO was not yet aware of any deaths associated with Omicron.On Wednesday, December 1, Tedros welcomed the “overwhelming support expressed by Member States for the need for a new accord on pandemic preparedness and response.”“I have one simple request for all Member States, and that is: end this pandemic,” he said.“As we mark World AIDS Day, we are reminded that more than 40 years into the global AIDS epidemic, we still have no vaccine and no cure for this disease. Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, we have not one but many vaccines, and many other effective tools.” Tedros said that “just in the past week, this virus has demonstrated that it will not simply disappear.”“How many more lives and livelihoods it takes is up to us. Ending the pandemic is not a matter of chance; it’s a matter of choice,” he said.“I call on all Member States to choose to achieve our targets of vaccinating 40% of the population of every country by the end of this year, and 70% by the middle of next year,” Tedros said.“I call on those countries that have already reached 70% to choose to swap your vaccine delivery schedules with COVAX and AVAT, as Switzerland has just done,” he said.The WHO chief also listed other recommendations and call to action for all member states and other countries:-for Member States to choose to remove every barrier to scaling up vaccine production, by sharing technology and know-how, and by supporting a waiver of intellectual property rights;-for countries that have promised to donate vaccines to choose to make good on those promises, as urgently as possible;-for Member States to choose to fully fund the ACT Accelerator, which needs 23.4 billion U.S. dollars over the next 12 months to get tests, treatments and vaccines to where they are needed most.-for every Member State to choose a comprehensive, tailored, layered combination of proven public health and social measures to reduce transmission, reduce the pressure on your health systems, and save lives;-for all Member States to focus on strengthening and optimizing clinical pathways, from primary to intensive care, ensuring the right patient get the right care at the right time, and that health workers are supported and protected while doing their life-saving work.-for Member States to intensify and target risk communication, strengthen community engagement, empowerment and support, addressing community concerns, combatting misinformation and building trust.-for every Member State to choose to increase surveillance, testing, sequencing and reporting, and to refrain from penalizing countries that do, in compliance with the International Health Regulations.-for all Member States to choose to commit to strengthening your WHO, especially by supporting the proposals of the Working Group on Sustainable Financing.“We are one humanity. We have one planet. We have one health. And we have one WHO. Your WHO,” Tedros added."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-omicron-warning-for-unvaccinated-vulnerable-travellers/,Purity or power: India’s coal quandary,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The WHO said Tuesday that those not fully vaccinated against Covid-19 who are also vulnerable to the disease, including over-60s, should put off travel to areas with community transmission.The World Health Organization also said blanket travel bans would not stop the spread of the Omicron variant.The new Covid-19 variant of concern, which the WHO says poses a “very high” risk globally, has prompted many countries to shut their borders.“Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread, and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods,” the WHO said in a travel advice statement on Omicron.“In addition, they can adversely impact global health efforts during a pandemic by disincentivising countries to report and share epidemiological and sequencing data.”First reported to the WHO less than a week ago after being detected in southern Africa earlier this month, Omicron has already appeared in several countries.The WHO noted the increasing number of governments introducing travel measures, including temporarily banning arrivals from countries where the variant has been found.The WHO said that as of Sunday, 56 countries were reportedly implementing travel measures aimed at potentially delaying the importation of the new variant.“It is expected that the Omicron variant will be detected in an increasing number of countries as national authorities step up their surveillance and sequencing activities,” it said.The WHO later issued a correction to the final part of that travel advice, relating who should be advised to postpone travel, and to where.“Persons who have not been fully vaccinated or do not have proof of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and are at increased risk of developing severe disease and dying, including people 60 years of age or older or those with comorbidities that present increased risk of severe Covid-19 (e.g. heart disease, cancer and diabetes) should be advised to postpone travel to areas with community transmission,” the WHO’s corrected line said.Elsewhere, the WHO advised countries to apply an “evidence-informed and risk-based approach” when implementing travel measures.The UN health agency said national authorities in countries of departure, transit and arrival could apply mitigation measures that might delay or reduce the exportation and importation of the variant.They could include screening passengers, testing and quarantine.“All measures should be commensurate with the risk, time-limited and applied with respect to travellers’ dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms.”The WHO said that “essential international travel”, including for humanitarian missions, repatriations and transport of vital supplies, should always be prioritised during the pandemic.– Earlier Tuesday, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told member states to keep calm and take “rational” steps in response to Omicron.“We call on all member states to take rational, proportional risk-reduction measures,” he said.“The global response must be calm, coordinated and coherent.”Tedros stressed that it remains unclear how dangerous the variant is.“We still have more questions than answers about the effect of Omicron on transmission, severity of disease, and the effectiveness of tests, therapeutics and vaccines,” he said.The WHO chief said it was understandable that countries wanted to protect their citizens “against a variant that we don’t yet fully understand”.“But I am equally concerned that several member states are introducing blunt, blanket measures that are not evidence-based or effective on their own, and which will only worsen inequities.”"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/what-is-known-so-far-about-new-covid-variant-omicron/,First image of Omicron shows many more mutations than Delta,1,"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AFP) — South African scientists have discovered a new Covid-19 variant, Omicron, with multiple mutations that is thought to be highly contagious.The World Health Organization has designated it a variant of concern and many countries are racing to try and contain it, banning flights from southern Africa.Scientists are working round-the-clock to dissect the variant and try understand its behaviour.Here is a brief explainer of what is known so far about Omicron — days after it emerged — as shared by South African scientists. It is currently unclear where the variant originated from, but South African scientists were the first to announce the discovery on November 25.By that time cases had been detected in Hong Kong and Botswana. A day later, Israel and Belgium also uncovered the variant. Scientists discovered the new variant with a “very unusual constellation of mutations” on November 23.Some of the mutations are already known, and affect transmissibility and immune evasion, but many others are new.It has the “most mutations we have seen to date”, said Professor Mosa Moshabela, Deputy Vice Chancellor of Research and Innovation at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.He said “some of these mutations we have seen before like in Delta and Beta,” but others they have not, and “we don’t know what the combination of those mutations will translate into.”Leading virologist Tulio de Oliveira said there were around 50 mutations overall, including 30 on the spike protein, the focus of most vaccines as it is what enables the virus to enter cells. The pace at which the new daily Covid cases are increasing in South Africa has left scientists suspecting it may be driven by the transmissibility of the new variant.Although not all are Omicron cases, the daily Covid positivity rate rose this week from 3.6 percent on Wednesday, 6.5 percent on Thursday, 9.1 percent on Friday and 9.2 percent on Saturday, according to official data.“Some of the mutations that are expressed have previously been shown to enable the virus to spread easily and quickly, and because of that we suspect that the (new variant) is going to spread quickly,” said Moshabela. Some of the genetic mutations shown by the virus include those known to enable the virus to evade immunity.It is unclear though what the impact will be on vaccines.As for the severity of the variant, scientists say it has only come to light this week, giving little time for thorough analysis."

In recent weeks, infections in South Africa have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection.“This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning,” the WHO said, pointing to worrying characteristics.“Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs.”It said the number of Omicron cases appeared to be increasing in almost all provinces of South Africa.As for testing for the strain, the WHO added: “Current SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics continue to detect this variant.”All viruses mutate over time, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19 disease.During late 2020, the emergence of variants that posed an increased risk to global public health prompted the WHO to start characterising them as variants of interest, and the more-worrying variants of concern, to inform the response to the pandemic.The UN health agency decided to name the variants after the letters of the Greek alphabet, to avoid the countries that first detected them being stigmatised.The WHO on Friday called on countries to increase their surveillance and virus sequencing efforts to better understand circulating variants.Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, urged people to reduce their chances of catching the virus.“We understand that people are concerned,” she said.“What’s really important as an individual is to lower your exposure.“These proven public health measures, have never been more important,” she said, citing distancing, mask-wearing, avoiding crowded spaces, good ventilation, “and when it’s your turn, get vaccinated”.https://youtu.be/sicQXifqqEwApart from South Africa, Omicron has been detected in Israel in a person coming from Malawi; Botswana; Belgium and Hong Kong.Despite countries scrambling to ban flights, the WHO earlier cautioned against imposing travel restrictions due to Omicron.The organisation said countries should take a risk-based and scientific approach when considering travel curbs in light of the variant — but cautioned against restrictions.“At this point, again, implementing travel measures is being cautioned against,” spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters.Besides Delta, Omicron and the three other VOCs, there are currently two lower variants of interest and below that, a further seven under monitoring.Delta, which is more transmissible than the original strain, is now overwhelmingly dominant around the world, having all but out-competed other variants.Of 845,000 sequences uploaded to the GISAID global science initiative with specimens collected in the last 60 days, 99.8 percent were Delta.rjm/apo/ach© Agence France-Presse"

With Delta, that has dropped to about 40 percent.”The more transmissible Delta variant is now overwhelmingly dominant around the world, having all but out-competed other strains.“If you are vaccinated, you have a much lower risk of severe disease and death but you are still at risk of being infected and infecting others,” said Tedros.“We cannot say this clearly enough: even if you are vaccinated, continue to take precautions to prevent becoming infected yourself, and infecting someone else who could die.”That meant wearing a facemask, maintaining distance, avoiding crowds and meeting others outside or only in a well-ventilated indoor space, he said.Of 845,000 sequences uploaded to the GISAID global science initiative with specimens collected in the last 60 days, 99.8 percent were Delta, according to the WHO’s weekly epidemiological report.Maria Van Kerkhove, the UN health agency’s technical lead on Covid, said the Delta variant itself was evolving and the WHO was trying to track circulation and changes in the virus.“We’re making plans here, looking through future scenarios about how much more this virus will change in terms of transmissibility or if there will be potential future immune escape, which will render some of our counter-measures less effective,” she said.The WHO has long stressed that the currently-available Covid-19 vaccines are primarily aimed at reducing the risk of severe illness, hospitalisation and death, rather than transmission.WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said that while vaccine protection against infection was not as high with Delta as with the variants it has overtaken, the level of prevention it gives against severe disease was “still above 80 percent in the majority of cases”.Europe’s return as the pandemic’s epicentre has been blamed on Delta, sluggish vaccine uptake in some nations, colder weather moving people indoors again and the easing of restrictions.Last week, more than 60 percent of all reported Covid-19 infections and deaths were in Europe, with the sheer number of cases translating into unsustainable pressure on health systems and exhausted health workers, said Tedros.Europe recorded more than 2.4 million new cases last week — an 11-percent rise on the week before. Infections were up 31 percent in Germany.WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said that people in Europe, even in the midst of a major resurgence in cases and huge pressure on health systems, were “back to pre-pandemic levels of social mixing”.“The reality is the virus will continue to transmit intensely in that environment,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"

Energy is a global market and crude prices are rebounding from the depths of the pandemic downturn last year, when they briefly went negative.The United States is dealing with a record wave of inflation as it goes through its own stronger-than-expected economic rebirth, with consumer prices seeing their biggest annual jump in more than three decades last month.“We and this administration are leaving no stone unturned as we examine the market to figure what’s behind the high prices,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters Tuesday.“If historical averages were true today, people would be paying about 30 cents less per-gallon at the pump based upon the differential between unfinished gas and gasoline at the pump.

They said it was impossible”, he remembers.Most online documents on Menkes Syndrome were in English, but undeterred Xu used translation software to understand them, before setting up a home lab in his father’s gym.On discovering copper histadine could help, he set up the equipment to create it himself, mixing copper chloride dihydrate with histidine, sodium hydroxide and water.Xu now gives Haoyang a daily dose of homemade medicine, which gives the child some of the copper his body is missing.The amateur chemist claims that a few of the blood tests returned to normal two weeks after beginning the treatment.The toddler can’t talk, but he gives a smile of recognition when his father runs a gentle hand over his head.His wife, who didn’t want to give her name, cares for their five-year-old daughter in another part of the city.Menkes Syndrome is more prevalent in boys than girls, and it is estimated one in 100,000 babies are born with the disease globally according to organisation Rare Diseases.There is little information or data available but Xu said pharmaceutical companies have shown little interest as the treatment “does not have commercial value and its user group is small.”Under normal circumstances, he would have travelled abroad to bring back treatments for Haoyang from specialist centres overseas, but China has largely closed its borders since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.Xu felt he had no choice but to make it himself.“At first, I thought it was a joke,” said Haoyang’s grandfather Xu Jianhong.“(I thought) it was an impossible mission for him.”But six weeks after throwing himself into the project, Xu produced his first vial of copper histidine.To test it he first experimented with rabbits and then injected the treatment into his own body.“The rabbits were fine, I was fine, so then I tried it on my son,” he said.Reassured, he then started gradually increasing the dosage.But the medicine is not a cure.Professor Annick Toutain, specialist of rare diseases at the Tours University Hospital in France, said the copper treatment “is only efficient against certain genetic anomalies and if it is administered very early on, in the first three weeks of life.”She said that after that the treatment will alleviate symptoms, “without leading to recovery.”Xu has accepted that it can “only slow down the disease”.His work has led to interest from VectorBuilder, an international biotech lab, who are now launching gene therapy research with Xu into Menkes syndrome.The company’s chief scientist Bruce Lahn described it as “a rare disease among rare diseases” and said they were inspired after learning about Xu’s family.Clinical trials and tests on animals are planned for the next few months.Xu has even been contacted by other parents whose children have been diagnosed with Menkes, asking him to make treatment for their relatives too — something he has refused.“I can only be responsible for my child,” he told AFP, while health authorities have said they will not intervene as long as he only makes the treatment for home use.Huang Yu of the Medical Genetics Department at Peking University told AFP that as a doctor he was “ashamed” to hear of Xu’s case.He said he hoped that “as a developing country, we can improve our medical system to better help such families.”With a full-time role as an amateur chemist, Xu has little income and relies mainly on his parents.Friends tried to talk him out of his medical efforts but undeterred, the young father is planning to study molecular biology at university and do everything he can to protect his son.“I don’t want him to wait desperately for death. Even if we fail, I want my son to have hope.”© Agence France-Presse"

We look forward to sharing these data with the FDA and other regulators.”The vaccine was granted “emergency use authorization” for adolescents by the US in May and the companies plan to soon seek full approval. The vaccine is currently only fully approved in people aged 16 and older.Among the 2,228 participants, there were 30 confirmed symptomatic Covid cases without evidence of prior infection, all in the placebo group.This corresponds to a vaccine efficacy of 100 percent. Efficacy was consistently high across gender, race, obesity levels and comorbidity status.The main safety concern among this age group is vaccine-linked myocarditis (heart inflammation) in males.But such cases are very rare, and the benefits of vaccination continue to strongly outweigh the risks, data has shown. Covid itself can cause myocarditis, both more often and a more severe form.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-authorizes-covid-boosters-for-all-adults-recommends-for-over-50s/,US authorizes Covid boosters for all adults,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The United States authorized the Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccine boosters for all people aged 18 and older on Friday, as the world’s hardest-hit country enters a new winter wave of the pandemic.Boosters were previously available to the immune compromised, people over 65, those at high risk of severe disease, and people in high risk occupations.The new decision “helps to provide continued protection against Covid-19, including the serious consequences that can occur, such as hospitalization and death,” acting commissioner Janet Woodcock of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said.A panel of experts convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) then ratified the decision to broaden eligibility, while explicitly recommending boosters for all people over 50, even absent underlying conditions.“I am really glad that we have clarity and streamlining of the recommendations so that all Americans can understand the vaccines that are recommended for them at this time,” said Camille Kotton, an infectious disease clinician at Massachusetts General Hospital.CDC director Rochelle Walensky formally signed off on the panel’s recommendations, stating that boosters “are an important public health tool to strengthen our defenses against the virus as we enter the winter holidays.”The FDA said it based its decision on data demonstrating a strong immune response to boosters from hundreds of people dosed with both brands of vaccines.Pfizer also carried out a clinical trial involving 10,000 people aged over 16 which found that the booster showed an efficacy against symptomatic infection of more than 95 percent compared to those who did not receive a booster.Both vaccines are available to people six months after completing their primary series.Pfizer’s vaccine is dosed at 30 micrograms, the same as the primary series, while Moderna’s is 50 micrograms, half the primary series.People who received the Johnson & Johnson one-dose vaccine were already eligible for a booster of any brand two months after their first shot.The booster decision comes as cases are rapidly rising nationally, reaching 88,000 new infections per day on average as the country enters its fifth wave, according to the latest data.America is officially the pandemic’s hardest-hit country, with more than 760,000 deaths. Prior to Friday’s decision, some outside experts had expressed misgivings over widening boosters to all adults.The vast majority of those people becoming hospitalized or dying with Covid are unvaccinated, and the best way to control the winter wave would be to reach those people, rather than topping up the vaccinated, the critics said.A potential downside, they argued, was that vaccine holdouts might conclude the shots are ineffective.Another risk is a greater number of cases of vaccine-linked heart inflammation (myocarditis), especially among younger males. Accumulating evidence shows the risk may be greater for the Moderna vaccine compared to Pfizer, likely because of its higher dose.Both companies are conducting post-authorization studies to assess the risks of myocarditis after third shots.Overall, however, both health agencies took the view that the benefits outweigh the risks.It is expected that boosters, by reducing symptomatic cases, will also help reduce community transmission, though the extent to which this might happen is not known.It is also possible that, rather than considering the third dose a booster, the vaccines work optimally when administered three times — something that will become more clear over time as data accrues.Experts are in broad agreement however that boosters alone can’t resolve the pandemic while the poorest countries, especially in Africa, remain stuck in the single-digit percentages for people covered by their initial shots.Last week, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus decried the fact that rich countries are administering six times more vaccine doses every day than low-income countries are delivering primary doses.This increases the risk of new variants of concern emerging in those regions, which could eventually evade the protective action of current vaccines.© Agence France-Presse"

Both belong to a class of antivirals called “protease inhibitors,” which block the action of an enzyme critical to viral replication.A treatment course consists of one pill every 12 hours for five days.“We were thrilled with the recent results of our Phase 2/3 interim analysis, which showed overwhelming efficacy of Paxlovid… and are pleased the US government recognizes this potential,” Pfizer Chairman and chief executive Albert Bourla said in its statement.“It is encouraging to see a growing understanding of the valuable role that oral investigational therapies may play in combatting Covid-19, and we look forward to continuing discussions with governments around the world to help ensure broad access for people everywhere.”Pills are easier to make than vaccines, do not require a cold chain for delivery and can be self-administered by the patient.Pfizer has entered into advance purchase agreements for its antiviral pill with several other countries and has initiated bilateral outreach to approximately 100 nations around the world, declaring itself committed to working on “equitable access” for the treatment at an affordable price.It announced a deal Tuesday with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) to sub-license production to generic manufacturers for supply in 95 low- and middle-income countries, covering around 53 percent of the world’s population.© Agence France-Presse"

Arrivals in countries are now rapidly ramping up as we strive to ensure countries have as many doses as they are able to administer,” said Berkley.“When donors and manufacturers give us visibility on when doses arrive, countries can plan large-scale national roll outs. This is the only way we will bridge our dangerous global vaccine divide.”More than 7.5 billion vaccine doses have been administered around the world, according to an AFP count.Some 143 doses per 100 people have been injected in high-income countries, compared to fewer than seven per 100 people in low-income nations.Gavi said Tuesday that five of the world’s poorest countries — Chad, the DR Congo, Congo, Haiti, South Sudan and Yemen — did not even have enough doses to reach two percent of their populations.The Covax collective development and procurement scheme was set up to counter the likelihood that much of the world would be shut out from access to any eventual vaccines.According to its forecasts, it should truly come into force throughout 2022.Meanwhile the WHO said that more than 3.3 million new coronavirus cases were reported last week — up six percent on the previous week.Just under 50,000 new deaths were registered, with all regions reporting stable or declining trends, apart from Europe which recorded a five-percent increase.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/its-official-science-says-grannies-are-good-for-you/,Covax hits 500 million Covid-19 vaccine dose deliveries,1,"WASHINGTON, D.C., United States (AFP) – Scientists say they have proven what many people fortunate enough to grow up with theirs have known all along: Grandmothers have strong nurturing instincts and are hard-wired to care deeply about their grandchildren.A new study published in the Royal Society B on Tuesday is the first to provide a neural snapshot of the cherished intergenerational bond.Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), researchers at Emory University in the southern US state of Georgia scanned the brains of 50 grandmothers who were shown pictures of their grandchildren, who were between three and 12 years old.As a control, they were also shown pictures of an unknown child, an adult parent of the same sex as their grandchild, and an unknown adult.“They recruited areas of the brain that are involved with emotional empathy, and also areas of the brain that are involved in movement and motor simulation and preparation,” James Rilling, an anthropologist and neuroscientist who led the study told AFP.“When they’re viewing these pictures of their grandchild, they’re really feeling what the grandchild is feeling. So when the child is expressing joy, they’re feeling that joy. When the children are expressing distress, they’re feeling that distress.”The same motor related regions of the brain also light up in the brains of mothers, and are thought to be related to the instinct to pick up a child or approach and interact with them.By contrast, when the grandmothers viewed images of their adult children, there was a stronger activation of brain regions linked to cognitive empathy — trying to understand what a person is thinking or feeling and why, without as much emotional engagement.This, said Rilling, might be linked to children’s cute appearance — scientifically known as “baby schema,” which the young of many species share in order to evoke a caregiving response.Unlike other primates, humans are “cooperative breeders,” which means mothers get help in rearing offspring.Rilling, who had previously conducted similar research on fathers, had wanted to turn his attention toward grandmothers in order to explore a theory in anthropology known as the “grandmother hypothesis.”This holds that the evolutionary reason that human females tend to live long lives — well beyond their own reproductive years — is to provide benefits to their grown offspring and grandchildren.Evidence supporting the hypothesis has been found in societies including Hadza hunter-gatherers of northern Tanzania, where grandmothers provide nourishing tubers to their grandchildren.The effect also been seen in other species such as elephants, and has been observed in orcas, which like humans — but unlike the vast majority of mammals — also experience menopause.“This is really the first look at the grand maternal brain,” said Rilling, explaining that brain scan studies on the elderly normally focus on studying conditions like Alzheimer’s disease.The grandmothers, who were drawn from the Atlanta, Georgia area and came from a cross-section of economic and racial backgrounds, were also asked to fill out questionnaires.Grandmothers who reported a greater desire to be involved with caring had greater activity in brain regions of interest.Finally, when comparing the new study with the results from his earlier work on fathers, Rilling found that overall, grandmothers more strongly activated regions involved with emotional empathy and motivation.But he stressed that this finding was only an average and doesn’t necessarily apply to any given individual.Rilling also interviewed each of his subjects to get a sense about the challenges and rewards of being a grandparent.“Consistently, the challenge that came up the most was the differences of opinion they would have with the parents in terms of how the grandchildren should be raised — their values, and the constant struggle to step back from that,” he said.On the other hand, “We joked about it, but a lot of them talked about how you can give the grandchildren back, it’s not a full time job,” he said.Many grandmothers felt they could be more present now that they were free of the time and financial pressure they experienced when raising their own children.“So a lot of them reported actually enjoying being a grandmother more than they enjoyed being a mother,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"

Similar results were seen within five days of symptom onset.Side-effects occurred in about one-in-five patients in both the treatment and placebo groups, and were mild in intensity.The treatment is given over five days.Pfizer has said it will deliver 180,000 courses of its Paxlovid pill this year and at least 50 million by next year.On Tuesday it announced a deal with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) to sub-licence production for supply in 95 low- and middle-income nations covering around 53 percent of the world’s population.Paxlovid is a combination of a new molecule, PF-07321332, and HIV antiviral ritonavir.Both belong to a class of antivirals called “protease inhibitors,” which block the action of an enzyme critical to viral replication.President Joe Biden’s administration is set to announce that it is purchasing 10 million courses of the pill, the Washington Post reported.The US is also buying 3.1 million courses of the Merck pill, Molnupiravir.Given the timeline between application for an EUA and subsequent authorization, it could be available by late this year or early next.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/down-but-not-out-growth-needs-fuel-indias-coal-addiction/,Pfizer asks US to authorize Covid pill,1,"NEW DELHI, India (AFP) – Even as its capital was blanketed by toxic smog, India led the charge to weaken anti-coal pledges at the COP26 summit, with experts saying it is prioritising its economic growth over the planet’s future.The world’s third-largest emitter teamed up with China to water down language on fossil fuels at the Glasgow conference, forcing a compromise: a climate deal that bound countries to “phase down” but not “phase out” coal use.India’s resistance to more ambitious curbs on dirty energy is driven by its need for cheap fuel to power a booming economy and lift hundreds of millions of its citizens out of entrenched poverty.“We have a huge population which has still not reached a basic minimum standard of living,” Samrat Sengupta, a climate change expert with the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, told AFP.Coal consumption has nearly doubled in the last decade — only China burns more — and the fuel still powers 70 percent of India’s electricity grid.The government has dragged its feet on tougher regulations for coal plants and just last year announced a series of commercial mining auctions to boost domestic production.Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to weaning his country off coal, but told Glasgow delegates India would only aim to be carbon-neutral by 2070 — a decade after China and 20 years after the world’s other big emitters.But without decisive action sooner, experts warn India’s emissions will soar in coming years and scuttle worldwide efforts to rein in global warming.The effects of India’s fossil fuel addiction are already keenly felt, with a shroud of thick grey haze enveloping New Delhi each winter.Coal plant emissions and vehicle exhaust fumes combine with smoke from farm fires to choke the megacity’s 20 million residents.On the same day that COP26 delegates were finalising the global climate accord, Delhi shut its schools for a week to keep children inside.Smog is blamed for more than a million deaths in India annually, and a recent University of Chicago study found that air pollution was likely to reduce life expectancy by more than nine years for four in every 10 Indians.Modi’s government aims to mitigate the problem by scaling up renewables, pledging to make solar power as big a share of the energy mix as coal by the end of the decade.But India lacks the high-tech capacity to meet demand for solar panels and relies heavily on expensive components from abroad.It has tried to spur domestic manufacturing of solar tech by hiking import duties, raising the cost of renewable energy.The 2030 solar goal “is a huge and a very stiff target to meet”, said Sengupta of the Centre for Science and Environment.“It requires a lot of cheap finance and technologies to be made available.”India has long argued that historical polluters such as the United States and Europe are obligated to provide the technical expertise and funding for climate mitigation.Its environment minister told COP26 delegates on Saturday that developing countries were “entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels”.Bhupender Yadav said nations with little historical responsibility for climate change should not be held to the same standards as the world’s biggest per-capita emitters.“In such a situation, how can anyone expect developing countries to make promises of phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies?” he asked.The weakened COP26 commitment was adopted with deep reluctance by other nations, which were anxious to get the deal over the line after two weeks of marathon negotiations.Other developing nations — including Pacific island countries facing the existential threat of rising sea levels as a result of global warming — bristled at the suggestion that India’s last-minute intervention was done on their behalf.Fiji’s attorney general Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum expressed “not just our astonishment, but immense disappointment in the manner in which this has been introduced”.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/air-pollution-in-europe-still-killing-300000-a-year-report/,Air pollution in Europe still killing 300,1,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AFP) — Premature deaths caused by fine particle air pollution have fallen 10 percent annually across Europe, but the invisible killer still accounts for 307,000 premature deaths a year, the European Environment Agency said Monday.If the latest air quality guidelines from the World Health Organisation were followed by EU members, the latest number of fatalities recorded in 2019 could be cut in half, according to an EEA report.Deaths linked to fine particular matter — with a diameter below 2.5 micrometres or PM2.5 — were estimated at 346,000 for 2018.The clear reduction in deaths for the following year were put down partly to favourable weather but above all to a progressive improvement in air quality across the continent, the European Union’s air pollution data centre said.In the early 1990s, fine particles, which penetrate deeply into the lungs, led to nearly a million premature deaths in the 27 EU member nations, according to the report.That figure had been more than halved to 450,000 by 2005.In 2019, fine particulate matter caused 53,800 premature deaths in Germany, 49,900 in Italy, 29,800 in France and 23,300 in Spain.Poland saw 39,300 deaths, the highest figure per head of population.The EEA also registers premature deaths linked to two other leading pollutants, but says it does not count them in its overall toll to avoid doubling up.Deaths caused by nitrogen dioxide — mainly from car, trucks and thermal power stations — fell by a quarter to 40,000 between 2018 and 2019.Fatalities linked to ground-level ozone in 2019 also dropped 13 percent to 16,800 dead.Air pollution remains the biggest environmental threat to human health in Europe, the agency said.Heart disease and strokes cause most premature deaths blamed on air pollution, followed by lung ailments including cancer.In children, atmospheric pollution can harm lung development, cause respiratory infections and aggravate asthma. Even if the situation is improving, the EEA warned in September that most EU countries were still above the recommended pollution limits, be they European guidelines or more ambitious WHO targets.According to the UN health body, air pollution causes seven million premature deaths annually across the globe — on the same levels as smoking and poor diet.In September, the alarming statistics led the WHO to tighten its recommended limits on major air pollutants for the first time since 2005.“Investing in cleaner heating, mobility, agriculture and industry improves health, productivity and quality of life for all Europeans, and particularly the most vulnerable,” said EEA director Hans Bruyninck.The EU wants to slash premature deaths due to fine air pollution by at least 55 percent in 2030 compared to 2005.If air pollution continues to fall at the current rate, the agency estimates the target will be reached by 2032.However an ageing and increasingly urbanised population could make that more difficult.“An older population is more sensitive to air pollution and a higher rate of urbanisation typically means that more people are exposed to PM 2.5 concentrations, which tend to be higher in cities,” said the report.© Agence France-Presse"

We have a right to clean air!”Security forces once again deployed heavily and used tear gas to prevent them from reaching the site.One protester told AFP the police had showed “contempt” for the town.“In the last 24 hours we’ve seen security forces protecting trash and crushing citizens, crushing residents’ rights to life, a healthy environment and a dignified life,” he said.Another said: “Close the landfill and we’ll go. Don’t close it and we’ll stay here a week, a month, a year, and fight until it closes.”He said the dump had plagued the town with disease and foul smells for 14 years.Both asked to remain anonymous.The Agareb landfill, the main such site in the Sfax region including Tunisia’s second city of the same name, closed in September under pressure from residents.Locals had complained it was full and that toxic chemical waste was being dumped at a facility only meant for household waste.Wednesday’s march came after the powerful UGTT trade union confederation called for a general strike across the public and private sectors over what it called a “savage intervention by security forces” on Monday evening.The wider Sfax region has been gripped by weeks of protests over the rubbish crisis, which has seen trash pile up in the streets.Since the Agareb facility closed, municipalities have refused to gather waste, calling on the state to find sustainable solutions.Tunisia has long suffered difficulties dealing with the estimated 2.5 million tonnes of rubbish produced every year, dumping the vast majority in landfills and recycling almost nothing.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/merck-expects-covid-pill-to-reach-rich-and-poor-countries-simultaneously/,Farm fires stoke Indian capital’s pollution crisis,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — US pharmaceutical giant Merck has vowed to avoid the pitfalls of the global Covid vaccine rollout by ensuring its new anti-coronavirus pill is made available in wealthy and poor countries at almost the same time.Paul Schaper, the company’s executive director of global public policy, told AFP that Merck, known as MSD outside the US and Canada, began working on its access strategy from July 2020, long before the efficacy results of the drug it developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics were announced in October 2021.The United Kingdom last week became the first country to authorize molnupiravir. In a clinical trial, the antiviral was shown to cut Covid hospitalizations by 50 percent among newly infected people, and also prevented 100 percent of deaths.“We started developing our supply chain very early on,” he said, with the company projecting it will have 10 million courses ready by the end of this year and at least double that figure in 2022.These, he said, would be priced according to a tiered framework that is based on a country’s ability to pay, as defined by World Bank data.Beyond its own supply, Merck struck deals with eight licensed generic partners in India, and has signed a voluntary licensing agreement with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool to facilitate access in 105 countries.On top of that, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation last month announced an investment of up to $120 million in an effort to speed access to lower-income countries through a “volume agreement” that ensures supply of drug ingredients.“In first quarter, in second quarter of 2022, we will have a significant amount of product from Merck available in low and middle income countries,” Schaper added, without speculating on a combined total between the various strands.“We have a really good chance of having really much more equitable access to this medicine than we’ve seen to date in the COVID response,” he said, adding it was possible to reach low-, middle- and high-income countries “at roughly the same time.”The rollout of Covid vaccines, by contrast, has been highly inequitable, with high income countries hoarding supply since rollout began in December 2020.While 51 percent of the world has now received one or more doses, that figure plunges to four percent of low-income countries, and three percent for the continent of Africa.On the other end of the scale, the United Arab Emirates has fully vaccinated 88 percent of its nearly 10 million people.While vaccines remain the “cornerstone” of the pandemic responses, “there’s going to be a need for therapeutics, and that’s probably an even greater need in areas where you have a lower percent of populations that are vaccinated,” said Schaper.Molnupiravir, as a small molecule, has the advantages of not requiring cold-storage like messenger RNA vaccines.Pfizer has also announced promising results for its oral Covid pill, paxlovid, and expects to produce 180,000 courses this year, and at least 50 million next year.It has begun talks with the Medicines Patent Pool but has not yet inked a deal.© Agence France-Presse"

I’m sure some of them will prove to be very safe and efficacious and others may not.“There could be advantages to some of the second generation vaccines… clearly if you have an oral vaccine or an intra-nasal vaccine this is easier to deliver than an injectable.“Ultimately we’ll be able to choose the ones that are most appropriate.“If not for Covid, we’re going to use these platforms for other infections in the future.”Swaminathan explained the advantages of a vaccine being sprayed into the nose, as happens in some countries with influenza vaccines.“If there’s a local immune response then it will take care of the virus before it even goes and establishes itself in the lungs and starts causing a problem,” she said.The WHO has only given emergency use authorisation to seven Covid-19 vaccines: those created by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sinopharm, Sinovac and last week Bharat Biotech.“None of the vaccines are 100 percent. Nobody has ever claimed that the vaccines are going to be 100 percent protective. But 90 percent is a wonderful amount of protection to have, compared to zero,” Swaminathan said.“Till now, with the vaccines that we have approved, there has not been any signal which has been so worrying that we need to say, well, we need to re-think this vaccine.”More than 7.25 billion vaccine doses have been administered around the world, according to an AFP count.© Agence France-Presse"

That review could be concluded in December, the agency reported last week.Pfizer’s vaccine is already licensed for use in young children in the United States, where Moderna’s is only approved for those 18 and up.Moderna had announced in late October that it would delay its application for US approval for kids six to 11 until the FDA had completed its review for the 12-17 age group, which could take until January.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/organic-farmers-find-fertile-ground-in-tunis/,nasal Covid vaccines,1,"TUNIS, Tunisia (AFP) – Proudly displaying her freshly picked pomegranates, Tunisian farmer Sarah Shili says going organic is “the future of farming” — and as demand surges in North Africa and beyond, the sector is blooming.Shili runs Domaine Elixir Bio, a 94-hectare (230-acre) farm near Tunis that produces organic-certified vegetable, fruit and cereal crops in a way she said “respects nature”.The farm’s revenues have surged thanks to strong demand and the growth of online sales, multiplying five times in as many years to hit 100,000 euros in 2020.That is despite the higher price of organic products in a middle-income country where many people’s wallets have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and years of economic crisis.Indeed, with export demand also on the rise, Shili says the main challenges are on the supply side.“We lack water, like all farmers, and to get organic seeds and plants we have to do everything ourselves,” she told AFP.Despite the challenges, the sector has surged in Tunisia since the turn of the millennium.In 2001, just 16,000 hectares were dedicated to organic farming — a figure that has multiplied 20-fold over two decades.The number of producers and venders has grown at a similar pace to some 8,000, said Samia Maamer, in charge of organic products at the agriculture ministry.Maamer said the sector has helped diversify the country’s economy and now makes up 13 percent of food exports.Out of 250 categories of organic products grown in Tunisia, around 60 are exported — mainly olive oil but also dates, aromatic and medicinal plants as well as some vegetables and fruit.Despite its small size, Tunisia ranks 30th in the world and first in Africa in terms of area certified for organic farming.Maamer said that apart from its chronic water shortages, “the climate in Tunisia is very favourable” to the trade.She added that only five percent of the country’s two million hectares of olive groves had been treated with pesticides, meaning the remainder could potentially win organic certification.“It’s a sector with ongoing and growing international demand,” said Maamer.And due to the coronavirus pandemic, people began increasingly looking for organic products “because… they don’t contain (artificial) chemicals”, she added.While there is strong demand in the US and Europe for bio products, they are also gaining attention among 25-30 year-old Tunisians “who are well-informed” about their benefits, she added.As the market grows, Tunisia hopes that by 2030 the sector will contribute to help develop tourism, renewables and handicrafts, she said.Bio farming is also on the rise in Morocco, where the area of farmland certified for organic production has more than doubled since 2011 to reach over 10,300 hectares.However, “that’s far behind the potential of a farming country like Morocco,” said Reda Tahiri, who heads a union for organic farmers.The majority of the country’s olive, citrus and almond groves are in the southern area around Marrakech and near the capital Rabat in the north-west.But given the country’s 300,000 hectares of aromatic and medicinal plants and the iconic argan tree, there is potential for going organic.Moroccan authorities are trying to develop the sector with the Green Morocco Plan, which helps farmers cover the costs of getting certified.For exports to the European Union to be labelled as organic, they must be inspected once a year by an EU-licenced certification agency.Tahiri said certification for export to European or North American markets can cost up to 1,000 euros ($1,115) per hectare annually.“So the total cost of production is higher than in conventional agriculture, but without the producer getting any guarantees of higher prices for the products,” he said.As well as state help on these costs, Tahiri says that for the organics market to develop, “we need to raise awareness among consumers and ensure better profit margins for producers”.Morocco’s agriculture ministry said it has prioritised organic agriculture and is hoping to reach 100,000 hectares of certified farmland by 2030, with 900,000 tonnes of produce per year — two-thirds of it for export.By comparison, Algeria is trailing.The semi-official economics and development think tank CREAD said that in 2013 just 1,200 hectares were being farmed organically.Although there are no recent statistics, in the past few years some shops have been offering customers organic vegetable boxes delivered straight from small producers.© Agence France-Presse"

So far all treatments have been either intravenous or vaccine shots.Pfizer’s is the second anti-Covid pill after that of Merck, which is actually an influenza medicine rebranded to fight the coronavirus. Pfizer’s has been created specifically to fight Covid.The Pfizer drug called Paxlovid achieved an 89 percent reduction in risk of hospitalization or death among adult patients with Covid who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness, the US company said.The results from the middle-to-late stage clinical trial were so strong that Pfizer will stop recruiting new people for the trial, it said.Pfizer will submit the data to the Food and Drug Administration as soon as possible as part of its “rolling submission” for Emergency Use Authorization.“Today’s news is a real game-changer in the global efforts to halt the devastation of this pandemic,” said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.“These data suggest that our oral antiviral candidate, if approved or authorized by regulatory authorities, has the potential to save patients’ lives, reduce the severity of Covid-19 infections, and eliminate up to nine out of 10 hospitalizations,” he added.Bourla told CNN he hopes the company can submit its authorization request before the Thanksgiving holiday, which this year falls on November 25.President Joe Biden said in remarks at the White House that the government has already secured millions of doses of the new medication.He said the pill “would be another tool in our toolbox to protect people from the worst outcomes of Covid.”The main analysis of the Pfizer pill data looked at numbers from 1,219 adults in North and South America, Europe, Africa and Asia.In the days immediately after symptoms appeared, some of them were given the experimental drug and others got a placebo — for five days, every 12 hours.Ten people who took the placebo died, while among those who got the Pfizer medication, none did. Several companies are working on so-called oral antivirals, which would mimic what the drug Tamiflu does for influenza and prevent the disease from progressing to severe.Britain on Thursday became the first country to approve an anti-Covid pill, as it greenlit the use of Merck’s antiviral drug called molnupiravir to treat patients suffering from mild to moderate coronavirus.Pfizer’s product is known as a “protease inhibitor” and has been shown in lab testing to jam up the virus’ replication machinery.If it works in real life, it will likely only be effective at the early stages of infection.By the time Covid progresses to severe disease, the virus has largely stopped replicating and patients suffer from an overactive immune response.Until now, Covid therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies and Gilead’s remdesivir — authorized for use in the EU under the name Veklury — have been administered intravenously.Merck’s molnupiravir was initially developed as an inhibitor of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus — two other important acute respiratory infections — by a team at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.Britain, which has been one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic, announced on October 20 that it had ordered 480,000 doses of molnupiravir.Pfizer is carrying out two other clinical trials with its pill: among people who are not at risk of progressing to severe Covid, and among people close to someone with Covid to see if it protects them against the illness.Besides Pfizer and Merck, the Swiss pharma giant Roche is also working on a Covid pill."

Those immunised between ages 16-18 saw a 34 percent dip, the study found.Cervical cancer, which is caused by HPV — a common sexually transmitted infection — is preventable with reliable and safe vaccines, and also curable if caught early and treated.Last year, the World Health Organization launched a global strategy to eliminate the disease, which is one of the most common female cancers and kills hundreds of thousands annually.While the latest study appears to support the broad use of HPV vaccines, uptake and availability of the shots pose an issue, according to a commentary accompanying the results.“Even in a wealthy country, such as England with free access to HPV immunisation, uptake has not reached the 90% vaccination target of girls aged 15 years set by WHO,” wrote gynaecologists Maggie Cruickshank and Mihaela Grigore.“Covid-19 is an additional challenge to delivering HPV vaccination but only adds to a long list, including access to affordable vaccines, infrastructure for low temperature-controlled supply chains, delivery, and waste disposal.”The authors of the study also noted several limitations, including that cervical cancer rarely appears in the age group they surveyed — individuals who today are no older than 25 — even in the absence of vaccines.© Agence France-Presse"

I think that if there is nothing they will turn to crime, to easy money,” he told AFP.The community and the government are keen to find a solution to this age-old conflict between conservation and survival.According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), mangroves protect coastlines from erosion and extreme weather events, improve water quality by filtering, and serve as nurseries for many marine creatures.They also help fight climate change — sequestering as much as 22.8 million tons of carbon each year in their leaves, trunks, roots and the soil.They can contain more carbon per square meter than tropical rainforests, according to UNEP.Panama’s mangroves, according to the environment ministry, hold some 52 million tons.But if degraded or lost, mangroves become sources of carbon dioxide and contribute to global warming — which threatens their survival in turn, particularly through sea level rise.At El Espave, the sea enters the bay gently, forming narrow passageways to the coast.Via these water routes, Rodriguez and his colleagues go out by boat every morning, travelling some 15 minutes to areas where the mangrove trunks grow thick. They fell them with machetes and electric saws.One of the men, Israel Gonzalez, 46, says the thinner plants are not touched, to preserve the ecosystem.“When we cut here, we always leave two, three or four trees for the seed to fall and continue to reproduce,” he explained.The community was also working on building a mangrove nursery, he said, to plant new seedlings and expand the forest they depend on so much.According to UNEP, over a quarter of the world’s original mangrove cover has already disappeared.Environment ministry official Jose Julio Casas said authorities were examining ways to work with the community “so that they can use the resource in a responsible way.”Currently engaged in an activity that is technically illegal, they “have to comply with a series of requirements because if they are going to use it, they themselves must help in the process of protecting and conserving the ecosystem,” Casas told AFP.At El Espave, charcoal production happens near the port, in an area dotted with pyramid-shaped pyres smoldering like small volcanos.“First you make the oven, then you stack the (mangrove) wood, then grass (to cover the wood), and then you put the sand” on top, Lesbia Batista 48, explained.Each “oven” smolders for about four days before being doused with water. Once cooled down, the soil is removed to reveal the coal underneath.Each pyre yields about 120 bags of coal that can collectively be sold for about $500 — an estimated $150 profit per “oven.”Besides its contribution to health-threatening air-pollution, coal burning is also one of the major sources of planet-warming greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere.“We are waiting for them (the government) to tell us how we can continue to produce charcoal, or that they bring us job proposals,” Batista.“We do not want to stop working, nor that they take this away from us.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-grants-indias-covaxin-jab-emergency-approval/,WHO grants India’s Covaxin jab emergency approval,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization on Wednesday issued an emergency use listing for the India-made Covaxin vaccine, in a move expected to increase Covid-19 jabs available in poor countries.The vaccine, made by India’s Bharat Biotech and with a 78-percent efficacy rate after two doses over a month “is extremely suitable for low- and middle-income countries due to easy storage requirements,” the UN body said.Covaxin is the first vaccine completely developed and manufactured in India to receive WHO approval.Unlike mRNA vaccines by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna that have emerged as leading jabs against Covid-19, Covaxin uses the more traditional “inactivated” technology that has been used for decades in vaccines against diseases like polio, seasonal influenza and rabies.The technology uses a dead version of a germ that causes a disease to boost the immune response.One of the main advantages of such vaccines is that they are more easily stored that mRNA jabs, which need to be kept at sub-zero temperatures. This makes them easier to distribute, especially in poor countries that may lack the needed facilities.Covaxin can be stored between 2-8 degrees Celsius (36-46 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the company website.India welcomed the move, with Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar tweeting that it “facilitates travel for many Indian citizens and contributes to vaccine equity.”– Group of eight – Covaxin becomes the eighth vaccine against Covid-19 on the WHO’s list, including others from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sinopharm and Sinovac.WHO emergency approval, which includes an assessment of clinical trial data, can speed up international recognition of vaccines.It also allows their use by fellow UN agencies and the global Covax initiative, set up to immunise people in the world’s least-well-off countries.India has administered 121.2 million shots of Covaxin, around 11 percent of the total.The vaccine, developed by Indian drug maker Bharat Biotech together with the Indian Council of Medical Research, was given “emergency approval” in India earlier this year without completion of phase 3 human trials.Despite criticism from doctors and health workers over the lack of data, the company and India’s drug regulator insisted it was safe for use.The firm says it has completed phase 3 trials but has yet to publish the results. In July, releasing “pre-print data,” the company claimed that an overall efficacy of 77.8 percent against symptomatic Covid-19 patients had been found.Prime Minister Narendra Modi received the vaccine in March this year as India started rolling out its mammoth vaccination programme, which has now seen more than a billion shots given.The delay in WHO approval has been a cause of worry for many Indians, in particular students, who have had problems returning to their universities abroad.As of now, around a dozen countries recognise the two-dose vaccine, including Greece, Iran, Mexico, Nepal, Zimbabwe and as of this week, Australia.India has also exported Covaxin to a number of countries including Iran, Myanmar and Zimbabwe.Brazil suspended a deal to import 20 million doses of Covaxin from India after corruption allegations.Owned by husband and wife, Krishan and Suchitra Ella, Bharat Biotech set up in 1996 and has delivered over three billion vaccines for several diseases including Zika and Hepatitis-B.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-father-of-cognitive-therapy-dies-at-100/,US father of cognitive therapy dies at 100,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — American psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck, considered the father of cognitive therapy — an approach developed in the 1960s that revolutionized the field of psychotherapy — died Monday at age 100.He died at his home in Philadelphia, according to a statement from his daughter Judith Beck, the president of the Beck Institute, an organization of thousands of professionals practicing cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT.“My father dedicated his life to the development and testing of treatments to improve the lives of countless people throughout the world facing health and mental health challenges,” she said.“He truly transformed the field of mental health.”Contrary to the psychoanalysis developed by Sigmund Freud — which emphasized the role of the subconscious and encouraged patients to delve into their memories — cognitive therapy is concerned with the present.Throughout his early years as a psychiatrist, Beck noticed that his patients frequently expressed negative thoughts, such as “I am incapable of…”, which he called “automatic thoughts.”Cognitive therapy directs patients to change the way they look at certain situations, and to identify those “automatic thoughts” in order to overcome them. They are then invited to test out those modified beliefs in everyday life.That approach is now the most widely practiced therapy method around the world, used to treat depression, anxiety, eating disorders, personality disorders and other psychiatric problems.“The idea was that if you sat back and listened and said ‘Ah-hah,’ somehow secrets would come out,” Beck told the New York Times in 2000, speaking about earlier psychotherapy methods.“And you would get exhausted just from the helplessness of it.”“I think I am ultimately a pragmatist,” he said during the same interview. “And if it doesn’t work, I don’t do it.”Beck was born in July 1921 in Providence, Rhode Island. He graduated from Brown University and Yale University, and wrote or co-wrote some 20 books.He and his daughter Judith Beck founded the Beck Institute in 1994, which has since trained more than 25,000 mental health professionals in 130 countries in cognitive behavioral therapy.More than 2,000 studies have demonstrated the efficacy of CBT, according to the institute.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-urges-vaccine-against-bacteria-killing-150000-babies-each-year/,WHO urges vaccine against bacteria killing 150,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization on Wednesday called for the urgent development of a vaccine against a bacterial infection responsible for nearly 150,000 stillbirths and infant deaths each year.A fresh report by the UN health agency and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that the impact of Group B Streptococcus infection (GBS), which is estimated to live harmlessly in the intestinal tracts of up to a third of all adults, is a far bigger cause of preterm births and disability than previously thought.The report confirmed a previous devastating finding from 2017 that the bacterium causes almost 100,000 newborn deaths and close to 50,000 stillbirths each year, although it pointed to significant data gaps suggesting the true figures could be higher.And for the first time it quantified the impact on preterm births, finding that GBS is behind more than half a million early deliveries each year, leading to significant long-term disability.In light of such staggering numbers, the report authors lamented that more progress had not been made towards developing a vaccine.“This new research shows that Group B strep is a major and underappreciated threat to newborn survival and wellbeing, bringing devastating impacts for so many families globally,” Phillipp Lambach of WHO’s immunisation department said in a statement.“WHO joins partners in calling for urgent development of a maternal GBS vaccine, which would have profound benefits in countries worldwide.”Professor Joy Lawn, who heads LSHTM’s maternal adolescent, reproductive and child health centre, agreed.“Maternal vaccination could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of babies in the years to come,” she said, decrying the lack of progress since the idea of developing a jab against GBS was first raised three decades ago.On average, 15 percent of pregnant women worldwide, or nearly 20 million annually, carry the GBS bacterium in their vagina.But even though most of these cases show no symptoms, an infected pregnant woman can pass GBS to her foetus via the amniotic fluid, or during birth as the infant passes through the vaginal canal.Babies and foetuses are particularly vulnerable because their immune systems are not strong enough to fight the multiplying bacteria.If untreated, GBS can lead to meningitis and septicaemia, which can be deadly. Babies that survive may develop cerebral palsy, or permanent sight and hearing problems.Wednesday’s report showed that the bacterium leaves some 40,000 infants each year with neurological impairments.Currently, women with GBS are given antibiotics during labour to reduce the chance of it passing to their baby.But this approach poses problems in places where screening and antibiotic administration during labour are less accessible.Tellingly, the highest rates of maternal GBS are found in sub-Saharan Africa — which alone accounts for around half of the global burden — and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, the study showed.It suggested that a GBS vaccine that could be administered to pregnant women during routine pregnancy checkups and that reached over 70 percent of pregnant women could avert 50,000 infant and foetus deaths each year.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-19-compared-with-other-deadly-viruses/,US approval for Moderna teen vaccines delayed,1,"The global death toll from Covid-19, which is set to pass five million, is already far worse than most other viral epidemics of the 20th and 21st centuries.But there have been notable exceptions. The post-World War I Spanish Flu wiped out more than 50 million people in 1918-19, according to some estimates.That is far more than the coronavirus pandemic, even if — as the World Health Organization says — Covid’s true toll is two to three times higher than official figures suggest.Here are some comparisons: The human toll of Covid-19, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, far outstrips that of other viral epidemics in the 21st century.In 2009, the H1N1 virus, or swine flu, caused a pandemic and left an official death toll of 18,500.The toll was later revised upwards by The Lancet medical journal to between 151,700 and 575,400.In 2002-2003, Covid’s predecessor SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) which emerged from China was the first coronavirus to spark global fears, but killed just 774 people. The Covid-19 toll has often been compared to that of seasonal flu, which, without hitting the headlines, accounts for between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths worldwide every year out of around five million serious cases, according to the WHO.In the 20th century, two major non-seasonal flu pandemics — Asian flu in 1957-1958 and Hong Kong flu in 1968-1970 — each killed around one million people, according to counts carried out afterwards.The greatest catastrophe of modern pandemics to date, the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918-1919 was also caused by a new virus.In three successive waves it wiped out 50 million to 100 million people, according to research published in the 2000s. The toll is much higher than the 10 million who died in World War I. The death toll from Covid-19 is far higher than that of the deadly haemorrhagic fever Ebola, which was first identified in 1976.The last major outbreak of Ebola killed nearly 2,300 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo between August 2018 and June 2020.In four decades, periodic Ebola outbreaks have killed some 15,300 people, all in Africa.Ebola has a far higher fatality rate than Covid-19: around 50 percent of people who are infected die from it.But Ebola is less contagious than other viral diseases, largely because it is not airborne but transmitted through direct and close contact.Other tropical viruses like Dengue fever, whose severe form can be fatal, cause a lower death toll.Dengue, which is passed on by mosquitos, has been on the rise for the past two decades but kills only a few thousand people every year — 4,032 in 2015, according to the latest WHO figure available. AIDS is by far the most deadly modern epidemic: since 1980 almost 36.3 million people around the world have died of the disease, which affects the immune system and cannot be cured.No effective vaccine has been found, but retroviral drugs, when taken regularly, efficiently stop the illness in its tracks and heavily reduce the risk of contamination.This treatment has helped bring down the death toll from its peak in 2004 of 1.7 million deaths to 680,000 in 2020, according to UNAIDS.The hepatitis B and C viruses, mainly transmitted by blood, also have a high death toll, killing more than one million people every year, most often in poor countries."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/merck-strikes-deal-for-global-access-to-covid-drug/,Covid-19 compared with other deadly viruses,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — US drugmaker Merck & Co. on Wednesday announced a deal that could see generic versions of its Covid-19 medication widely distributed in poorer countries, in a first during the pandemic.The global Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) said it had signed a voluntary licensing agreement with Merck to facilitate affordable worldwide access for its investigational oral antiviral medicine molnupiravir.Subject to regulatory approval, the deal will help create broad access to molnupiravir in 105 low- and middle-income countries.The US and European Union medicines regulators are reviewing the drug.Antivirals like molnupiravir work by decreasing the ability of a virus to replicate, thereby slowing down the disease.Given to patients within days of a positive test, the treatment halves the risk of hospitalization, according to a clinical trial conducted by Merck, also called MSD outside the United States.Merck’s deal with MPP is “a positive step towards creating broader access to treatment as quickly as possible,” the World Health Organization said in a statement.But it urged the drugmaker to “provide data of clinical trials to WHO as soon as possible so the agency can evaluate the medicine for global use”.It also pressed Merck to “include other key countries in the scope of the agreement in the near future”.The Geneva-based MPP is a United Nations-backed international organisation that works to facilitate the development of medicines for low- and middle-income nations.Under the deal, Merck grants a licence to the MPP, under which the organisation can then sub-licence to makers of generic drugs.The deal means the drug’s developers will not receive sales royalties while Covid-19 remains classified as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the WHO.A PHEIC is the highest alarm the WHO can sound and its emergency committee last week reconfirmed the pandemic’s top-alert status.“The interim results for molnupiravir are compelling and we see this oral treatment candidate as a potentially important tool to help address the current health crisis,” said MPP executive director Charles Gore.Merck is jointly developing molnupiravir with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.The Miami-based company’s chief executive Wendy Holman said the deal meant “quality-assured generic versions of molnupiravir can be developed and distributed quickly following regulatory authorisation”.The MPP was founded by Unitaid, which works on innovations to prevent, diagnose and treat major diseases in poorer countries.Molnupiravir prices have not yet been determined, but its simplicity, plus competition among generic manufacturers should mean low prices in the 105 poorer countries, said Unitaid spokesman Herve Verhoosel.He said in countries with low vaccination rates, millions would need the drug to prevent progression to serious illness.“We also need to see this licence followed by others as soon as possible for other key promising products expected to come out of the pipeline soon, for which we also need to ensure broad supply and affordability,” Verhoosel added.While the search for vaccines has resulted in multiple products being approved for emergency use in the pandemic, the hunt for treatments for those who have already caught the disease has not been as fruitful.The medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) welcomed the announcement but said it did not go far enough.“The licence excludes key upper-middle-income countries like Brazil and China from its territory, where there is strong, established capacity to produce and supply antiviral medicines,” MSF senior policy advisor Yuanqiong Hu said.“Furthermore, the licence contains an unacceptable clause undermining the rights to challenge patents on molnupiravir.”Hu said the agreement underlined the urgent need for a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights for all Covid-19 medicines, vaccines and tests.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/orkneys-seaweed-eating-sheep-offer-hopes-of-greener-farming/,Merck strikes deal for global access to Covid drug,1,", On a tiny island in Scotland’s far-flung Orkneys, thousands of sheep spend the winter munching on seaweed, a unique diet that scientists say offers hope for reducing planet-warming methane emissions.Around 60 people share North Ronaldsay — an island just over 3 miles (5 kilometres) long, ringed by rocky beaches and turquoise waters off the north coast of mainland Britain — with the distinctive native sheep.Boasting brown, beige or black wool, the animals are hemmed into its foreshore owing to a large system of stone walls — called a sheep dyke — built in the early 19th century to keep them away from fields and roads.The island’s crofters — people who live and work on so-called croft agricultural land — wanted to use every available space to grow crops and as pasture for cows.The unintended result: in summer the sheep can nibble on grass, but by winter eating the plentiful seaweed is their only means of survival.While some other mammals — including Shetland ponies native to the neighbouring island chain, and red deer — are known to snack on seaweed, scientists say that the North Ronaldsay sheep are unique worldwide for spending months eating only the marine plants.With the world facing a deepening climate emergency, they are increasingly seen by some as a case study that could lead to a breakthrough in methods for raising livestock, which is a major source of greenhouse gases.Farm animals belch and fart methane gas which, though trivial sounding, is about 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.Given the vast scale of the global meat industry, the issue has become a major focus for climate scientists — just as world leaders prepare to gather in the Scottish city Glasgow from Sunday for the crucial COP26 summit.The seaweed diet of the Orkney sheep has an effect on their complex digestive system and appears to reduce the amount of methane produced.“There’s different components in the seaweed that actually interfere with the process (of) how methane is made,” said Gordon McDougall, a researcher at The James Hutton Institute in Dundee in eastern Scotland who has been examining the sheep’s diet for two decades.Researchers at The University of California, Davis, published results in March showing that a “bit of seaweed in cattle feed could reduce methane emissions from beef cattle as much as 82 percent”.David Beattie, another James Hutton Institute scientist, stressed there is huge interest in such innovation.“There’s a really big movement within the industry to try and cut out the carbon footprint that the industry as a whole has,” he told AFP.“I see seaweed playing a part in that.”This would not necessarily mean cows and sheep switching to a diet entirely comprised of seaweed like the North Ronaldsay sheep, but it could supplement their usual feed.Seaweed is not available in large enough quantities to feed so many animals, McDougall noted, and taking away too much from the sea could also damage the environment and ecosystems.But the marine plants — good sources of minerals, vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids — could partly replace soy, which is heavily used in animal feed but transported for thousands of miles and linked to deforestation.Researchers still need to determine the types and quantities of seaweed which could be best suited to adding to feed.“And then, can you scale that up to a level where you’d actually have an effect on the overall UK farming?” said McDougall.The plump North Ronaldsay sheep, who chow down strands of seaweed as if they were spaghetti, are set to keep providing a useful case study.© Agence France-Presse"

The vast majority were discharged but five remain in intensive care.The rate will probably be lower in the five-to-11 age group than among adolescent males, because it is thought to be linked to testosterone.The panel weighed this theoretical risk against preventing Covid, which may cause more frequent and severe myocarditis.The meeting comes as the United States is emerging from its latest wave driven by the Delta variant.Overall, 57 percent of the total population is now fully vaccinated.Vaccine confidence has risen in recent months, but the United States remains behind every other G7 nation in percent of population fully vaccinated.© Agence France-Presse"

But of course, that average masks huge differences,” he said.“In Africa, less than in one in 10 health workers have been fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, in most high-income countries, more than 80 percent of health workers are fully vaccinated.”He added: “We call on all countries to ensure that all health and care workers in every country are prioritised for Covid-19 vaccines, alongside other at-risk groups.”Annette Kennedy, president of the International Council of Nurses, said the organisation grieved for all health care workers who had lost their lives in the pandemic — “many needlessly; many we could have saved”.“It’s a shocking indictment of governments. It’s a shocking indictment of their lack of duty of care to protect health care workers who have paid the ultimate sacrifice,” she said.Kennedy warned: “They are now burnt out, they are devastated, they are physically and mentally exhausted. And there is a prediction that 10 percent of them will leave within a very short time.”The WHO wants each country to have vaccinated 40 percent of its population by the end of the year, but Tedros said 82 countries are at risk of missing that target, chiefly through insufficient supply.In high-income countries, as categorised by the World Bank, 133 doses have been administered per 100 people. In the 29 lowest-income nations, the figure drops to five.Former British prime minister Gordon Brown, now a WHO ambassador for global health financing, said the October 30-31 G20 summit in Rome would be a critical juncture in combating the pandemic.If the world’s richest countries cannot mobilise an immediate airlift of doses to the unvaccinated in poorer nations, “an epidemiological, economic and ethical dereliction of duty will shame us all”, said Brown, who hosted the 2009 G20 summit.He said that by February, wealthy nations could have built up an unused stockpile of one billion vaccine doses, and denying them to the unvaccinated would be “one of the greatest international public policy failures imaginable”.“It’s a moral catastrophe of historic proportions that will shock future generations,” he said.The novel coronavirus has killed at least 4.9 million people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP, while nearly 242 million cases have been registered.Brown said that without reallocating the growing stockpile, the WHO’s latest forecast was that there could be 200 million more Covid cases, with five million lives hanging in the balance.© Agence France-Presse"

There were 170 against with 76 abstentions.“MEPs highlighted the need for enhanced sustainability at every step of the food supply chain and reiterated that everyone — from farmer to consumer — has a role to play in this,” a statement from the parliament said.The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) called the vote “a hugely important sign of support” for the initiative that aims to cut pesticide use in half by 2030, reduce fertiliser use and commit 25 percent of farming land as organic.“The agri-industry used the tried and tested tactics of scaremongering to delay action by focusing on partial and biased ‘evidence’. However, the science is solid and unquestionable,” said Jabier Ruiz, an agriculture expert at WWF.“With their vote, MEPs showed that they are not ready to cave in.”The legislators recommended the European Commission include “binding reduction targets for pesticide use” and mandatory nutritional labelling on food.They also called for a non-binding vote on measures to reduce overconsumption of meat and end cage-rearing of animals.In a bid to offset fears that the push could harm farmers, lawmakers called for steps including changes to competition rules.The European Commission — which still has to put forward legislative proposals on the strategy — hailed the vote.“The EU is ready to lead this positive change,” tweeted food safety commissioner Stella Kyriakides.© Agence France-Presse"

Many countries vaccinate adolescents from the age of 12, but very few do so below that age.In recent months, the World Health Organization (WHO) has insisted that the urgent issue was to immunize the population of poor countries before children and adolescents in rich countries.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/running-out-of-time-asia-struggles-to-kick-coal-addiction/,‘Running out of time’: Asia struggles to kick coal addiction,1,"CILEGON, Indonesia (AFP) – Smokestacks belch noxious fumes into the air from a massive coal-fired power plant on the Indonesian coast, a stark illustration of Asia’s addiction to the fossil fuel which is threatening climate targets.Asia-Pacific accounts for about three-quarters of global coal consumption — even as the region struggles with the environmental and public health impacts of global warming, from deadly levels of air pollution in India to extreme heatwaves and wildfires in Australia.Hopes for a cleaner future have been fired by pledges from top coal consumer China and other countries to go carbon neutral but much of the region is making a painfully slow transition to renewable sources.“We are moving much slower than the impact of climate change. We are running out of time,” warned Tata Mustasya, a Greenpeace energy campaigner in Indonesia.Change is hard in one of the last bastions of the dirtiest fossil fuel, however — five Asian countries are responsible for 80 percent of new coal power stations planned worldwide, according to a report from Carbon Tracker.Commitments that have been made are too weak, analysts say, with promises to halt construction of plants and tighten overseas funding from key financing countries often not covering projects already planned.And critics say that rich nations are not providing enough help, in terms of financing or technical know-how, to help poorer countries make the transition.The challenge is illustrated by the enormous Suralaya coal plant on Indonesia’s Java island, one of the biggest in Southeast Asia, which can power about 14 million homes a year.Indonesia has committed to be carbon neutral by 2060, and to stop building new coal-fired plants from 2023, but despite this — the facility is undergoing a $3.5 billion expansion that will boost its capacity.Burning coal is responsible for a massive chunk of carbon dioxide emissions, making it a major threat to limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, as agreed in the 2015 Paris climate deal.But beyond its contribution to global warming, it also exacts a heavy toll on local communities.At a village of red-roofed houses in the shadow of the Suralaya plant, coal dust often builds up on rooftops and residents complain of poor health.“Problems reported in the area include coughing and breathing difficulties,” said Misnan Arullah, from NGO Suralaya Care Forum, which campaigns on behalf of those affected by pollution.“People complain of irritation to their eyes when they are out working in the fields.”Resident Edi Suriana said his sister-in-law, who used to run a stall on a beach close to where ash from the plant was dumped, died in 2010 after developing lung problems.“She was exposed to coal dust when she was working at her stall,” he told AFP. “The shop was around 20 to 50 metres from the place where they dumped ash.”Medics were unable to draw a firm conclusion on her cause of death, but Suriana said the family believes it was due to the pollution.And local fisherman Suwiro blamed the plant for a dramatic fall in the size and quality of his catches over the years.“I used to be able to catch 100 kilograms of fish every time I went out to sea,” said the 60-year-old, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.“But since the sea has become so polluted, we are lucky to get five to 10 kilos.”The Suralaya plant expansion has received $1.9 billion of South Korean public financing and is backed by its state-owned electricity giant KEPCO, according to NGO Solutions for Our Climate (SFOC).It is going ahead despite a vow by Seoul earlier this year not to fund any more overseas coal plants.A KEPCO representative told AFP the project — which is due for completion in 2024, and could still run for decades — was not affected by the announcement as it began beforehand.Such cases show governments have “committed to stop digging the hole deeper — but they haven’t really come up with a plan to climb out,” said Sejong Youn, from SFOC.The world’s biggest polluter, China, has vowed to go carbon neutral by 2060, and last month said it would stop its overseas funding of coal power stations.But few further details have been released, such as whether projects in the pipeline would be affected.Nearly 60 percent of China’s economy is still powered by the fossil fuel and in a sign of the difficulties ahead, this month authorities even ordered mines to expand production to cope with a nationwide energy crunch.Japan, another major Asian financier of coal overseas, has also pledged to tighten rules for investment in foreign power stations but will not end government funding.A major complaint from developing nations is the failure to deliver enough aid to help curb carbon pollution, with rich countries falling short on a pledge to provide $100 billion annually.Going into next month’s COP26 climate summit, a key demand of India, the world’s second biggest coal consumer, is for more international help financing renewable energy and to mitigate climate impacts.New Delhi has so far resisted pressure to set a target date for its emissions to reach net zero, and is even pushing ahead with new investments in coal mining.To make progress, the developed world needs to take a constructive approach in its dealings with poorer countries, said Carlos Fernandez Alvarez, senior energy analyst at the International Energy Agency.“It is not just about saying ‘phase out your coal plants’. We need to offer solutions. It’s about policies, finances, technology — everything,” he told AFP.Despite the challenges, there are positive signs, with many financial institutions in Asia stopping or slowing investments in coal in recent times.China plans to increase the non-fossil fuel share of energy consumption from 16 percent to 20 percent by 2025, while India has pledged to quadruple renewable electricity capacity by 2030, according to the IEA.But activists say more needs to be done urgently.“Climate-induced disasters are happening everywhere now in Asia,” said Greenpeace’s Mustasya.Climate change “is happening very fast — but commitments are very slow,” he added.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-panel-votes-to-authorize-jj-covid-vaccine-booster/,US panel votes to authorize J&J Covid vaccine booster,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — A high level panel of US medical experts voted unanimously Friday to recommend authorizing a second shot of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine.The decision will help end a sense of limbo for 15 million Americans who received the first dose but were worried whether it was enough to protect them, particularly after the rise of the Delta variant.The committee members, convened by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), agreed with the pharmaceutical company that safety and efficacy evidence favored a second dose.The recommendation may be tweaked further by the FDA and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and an emergency use authorization should follow within days to weeks.Several of the independent experts suggested that though J&J had applied to authorize a booster, a second J&J vaccine should in fact be regarded as an “additional” dose needed to achieve full vaccination.“I think this frankly was always a two-dose vaccine. It’s hard to recommend this as a one-dose vaccine,” said Paul Offit, a vaccine expert from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.The panel was also asked to discuss, but not to vote on, the question of so-called “mix and match” boosting, in which a person receives a different brand or type of vaccine as a booster than that used for the initial dose.But FDA scientist Peter Marks said “it’s possible” that question will be voted on in future.A preliminary study this week showed that people who have received the J&J vaccine may benefit from a booster dose of a different, messenger-RNA vaccine such as Pfizer or Moderna.The single shot J&J vaccine was never as effective as its double-shot mRNA counterparts, but some evidence suggests it is less susceptible to waning than Pfizer and Moderna, because of the viral vector technology behind it.Nevertheless, the company presented data showing efficacy against symptomatic Covid rose from 70 to 94 percent in a US trial after a second dose given two months after the first, similar to figures associated with mRNA vaccines.Friday’s meeting came after the same panel voted Thursday to authorize a booster dose of Moderna’s vaccine for at-risk groups.In that meeting, the panel decided to authorize a booster dose of Moderna for the over-65s, people aged between 18 and 64 who are at a higher risk of developing a severe version of the coronavirus, and those whose work may involve frequent exposure to the virus.A similar decision was already reached for the Pfizer vaccine several weeks earlier, with experts concerned a booster might not be suitable for everyone, especially younger males at risk of developing myocarditis (heart inflammation) as a side effect.But the J&J decision applies more broadly, to everyone over 18 who received the first shot of the vaccine at least two months earlier.Serious but extremely rare safety concerns include blood clotting with low platelets, particularly in younger women, and Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a rare immune disorder that causes muscle weakness and sometimes temporary paralysis.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-experts-recommend-moderna-booster-for-older-and-at-risk-groups/,US experts recommend Moderna booster for older and at-risk groups,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — An expert committee on Thursday recommended a booster dose of Moderna’s anti-Covid vaccine in the United States for certain at-risk groups, a month after making a similar decision for the Pfizer shot.The opinion submitted by the advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration — composed of researchers, epidemiologists and infectious disease experts — is not binding, but it is rare for the FDA not to follow it.After a day of debate, the experts decided to authorize a booster dose of Moderna for three categories of people: the over-65s, people aged between 18 and 64 who are at a higher risk of developing a severe version of the coronavirus, and those whose work may involve frequent exposure to the virus.The same definitions were adopted for the Pfizer booster.The last category includes supermarket workers, health workers, prisoners and people in homeless shelters.The booster can be administered six months after the second injection of Moderna’s vaccine. The dosage is 50 micrograms, which is half the dosage of the initial shots.A Moderna representative told the panel the booster would help combat the Delta variant, at a time when vaccine effectiveness has been observed to decline over time against infection and mild cases of the disease, even though it remains effective against severe cases.The committee will meet again on Friday to deliver its verdict on a booster dose for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.It will also discuss the results of a study published this week that looked at the possibility of using a different vaccine for the booster shot than that used for the initial dose, which at the moment is not authorized in the United States.The study suggests that people who have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine may benefit from a booster dose of a different, messenger-RNA vaccine such as Pfizer or Moderna.Almost 15 million Americans have received a dose of the J&J vaccine, and nearly 70 million are fully vaccinated with Moderna.If the FDA officially allows booster shots for these two vaccines, an expert committee from the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) will in turn have to deliver its own opinion next week, at a meeting scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.As a final step, the CDC will have to publish precise recommendations for these injections, intended for healthcare professionals administering them.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/moderna-or-pfizer-booster-works-better-for-people-vaccinated-with-jj-study/,Moderna or Pfizer booster works better for people vaccinated with J&J: study,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — People who received Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine may benefit from a booster dose of Pfizer or Moderna, preliminary results of a US study published Wednesday showed.The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was eagerly awaited in the United States because it looked at the possibility of “mixing” vaccines — using a different vaccine than the initial doses for the booster shot — which is not currently allowed in the country.The study was conducted on 458 adults who had been vaccinated with one of three US-approved brands (Pfizer, Moderna or J&J) for at least 12 weeks.These three groups were each divided into three new groups to receive one of the available vaccines as a booster. The nine groups consisted of about 50 people each.Researchers then analyzed antibody levels 15 days after the booster shot.For people originally inoculated with J&J, antibody levels were four times higher after a J&J booster, 35 times higher after a Pfizer booster and 76 times higher after a Moderna booster.And antibody levels for those who had originally received Moderna shots were higher “irrespective of the booster vaccine administered,” when compared with those who had initially received Pfizer or J&J, the study said.Additionally, “no safety concerns were identified” after booster doses were administered, it found.The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, has several limitations, however.The number of participants was small, and the immune response could evolve over time, beyond the 15 days observed during the study.“Important not to get too carried away with the findings,” tweeted Peter Hotez, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine.Results from trials on a second J&J booster shot conducted by the company itself were “impressive,” he said.The NIH study should fuel discussions by a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expert committee, which is scheduled to consider applications for a booster dose from Moderna and J&J on Thursday and Friday, respectively.A booster from Pfizer has already been approved in the United States for certain populations, such as people aged 65 or older, adults with high-risk medical conditions and those in jobs where they are frequently exposed to the coronavirus.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/el-nino-puts-millions-in-childhood-malnutrition-study/,El Nino puts millions in childhood malnutrition: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) – Changing rain patterns caused by the El Nino warming phenomenon frequently drives millions of children into malnutrition and saddles them with life-long health issues, researchers said Tuesday, calling for action against the “predictable” impact.El Nino is a periodic event that affects global weather patterns, occurring every few years when eastern Pacific Ocean waters get unusually warm, leading to heavy rain in some regions but relative drought in others.US-based researchers examined 40 years worth of data for more than one million children across all developing country regions and compared their weight in El Nino with non-El Nino years.They found that warmer and drier El Nino conditions increased childhood malnutrition across the tropics — a part of the world where 20 percent of children are already severely underweight.Crucially, while the children’s weight appeared to rebound following an El Nino, the shock to their nutrition caused by the phenomenon led to stunted growth for years., the team found that a typical El Nino event saw childhood malnutrition rates soar as much as three times higher than that witnessed during the coronavirus pandemic.“It would have been very difficult to prepare the world for a pandemic that few saw coming,” said co-author Amir Jina, from the Harris School of Public Policy.“But we can’t say the same about El Nino events that have a potentially much greater impact on the long-term growth and health of children.”In 2015, a particularly strong El Nino year, the team found that an additional six million children were driven into malnutrition.While it is unclear if global heating will increase the frequency of El Nino years, it is already making hot and dry areas hotter and drier.The authors of Tuesday’s paper said that El Nino had contributed heavily in holding back the developing world’s efforts to reduce hunger.But since the event can be predicted by climatologists at least six months in advance, they called for governments to integrate El Nino into their humanitarian plans.“These are routine events in the climate that lead to real tragedy around the world,” said Jesse Anttila-Hughes, from the University of San Francisco.Anttila-Hughes said that further study of how El Nino affects crop cycles on a regional level could provide insight into how food systems globally are likely to adapt to a warming world.“But the fact that we live through an El Nino every few years, we know they’re coming, and we still don’t act is a bad sign since many of these climate shifts… will be a lot less predictable as the climate changes,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/widely-used-chemical-linked-to-100000-us-deaths-per-year-study/,Widely used chemical linked to 100,1,"NEW YORK, United States (AFP) — Daily exposure to phthalates, a group of chemicals used in everything from plastic containers to makeup, may lead to approximately 100,000 deaths in older Americans annually, a study from New York University warned Tuesday.The chemicals, which can be found in hundreds of products such as toys, clothing and shampoo, have been known for decades to be “hormone disruptors,” affecting a person’s endocrine system.The toxins can enter the body through such items and are linked to obesity, diabetes and heart disease, said the study published in the journal Environmental Pollution.The research, which was carried out by New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine and includes some 5,000 adults aged 55 to 64, shows that those with higher concentrations of phthalates in their urine were more likely to die of heart disease.However, higher concentrations did not appear to increase the risk of death by cancer.“Our findings reveal that increased phthalate exposure is linked to early death, particularly due to heart disease,” said study lead author Leonardo Trasande.“Until now, we have understood that the chemicals connect to heart disease, and heart disease in turn is a leading cause of death, but we had not yet tied the chemicals themselves to death.”Trasande cautioned, however, that the study does not establish a direct cause and effect relationship between phthalate exposure and death, in part because the specific biological mechanisms of that relationship are unclear.“Our research suggests that the toll of this chemical on society is much greater than we first thought,” Trasande said, adding that it “is undeniably clear that limiting exposure to toxic phthalates can help safeguard Americans’ physical and financial wellbeing.”Other studies have already linked phthalates to more than 10,000 deaths per year associated with reduced testosterone levels in adult men.The study added that the economic loss due to phthalates is between $40 billion and $47 billion — more than four times what was previously estimated.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/daily-aspirin-may-harm-more-than-help-seniors-us-medical-panel/,000 US deaths per year: study,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — A US government expert panel said Tuesday it no longer recommends a daily dose of aspirin to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in people aged 60 and over.People aged 40-59 who are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease but have no history of it, should consult with their doctor and make an individual decision on whether to start taking the medicine.The statement was a major reversal in the US medical field, where taking aspirin daily is a widespread practice. The medication thins blood, helping prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke.Since 2016, the Preventive Services Task Force, a government medical expert panel, has recommended a daily dose of aspirin for people in their 50s who have a 10 percent or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years.The panel also said at the time that for at-risk people in their 60s, the decision to take aspirin should be an individual one.But for several years, studies have questioned those recommendations.On Tuesday, experts said that aspirin’s benefits were not enough to offset the increased risk of bleeding, especially in the brain or intestines, in older people.“Daily aspirin use may help prevent heart attacks and strokes in some people, but it can also cause potentially serious harms, such as internal bleeding,” said Task Force member John Wong. “It’s important that people who are 40 to 59 years old and don’t have a history of heart disease have a conversation with their clinician to decide together if starting to take aspirin is right for them.”These new recommendations are not yet final. They will be open to public debate until early November.They also do not apply to patients taking aspirin after suffering a stroke or heart attack, the statement said.An estimated 600,000 Americans suffer a first heart attack, and about 610,000 a first stroke.Taking aspirin to reduce this risk of heart disease is often a spontaneous decision for many Americans. According to a 2017 study, 23 percent of adults aged 40 and over who don’t have cardiovascular disease took aspirin as a preventive measure, of whom 23 percent did so without a doctor’s recommendation.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-experts-back-extra-covid-jab-for-people-with-weak-immune-systems/,Daily aspirin may harm more than help seniors: US medical panel,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization’s vaccine advisers on Monday recommended people with weakened immune systems should be offered an additional dose of all WHO-approved Covid-19 vaccines.The UN health agency’s experts also said over-60s fully immunised with China’s Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines should be offered an additional third vaccine dose.The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) stressed it was not recommending an additional booster dose for the population at large, which is already being rolled out in some countries.The WHO wants a moratorium on booster doses for the general population until the end of the year to prioritise first doses in the dozens of nations starved of vaccines.The WHO’s target of getting 10 percent of the population in each country fully vaccinated by the end of September was missed by 56 states. However almost 90 percent of high-income countries hit the target.SAGE said it would review the issue of general booster doses on November 11.Several Covid-19 vaccines have been given WHO approval for emergency use during the pandemic: Pfizer-BioNTech, Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm, Sinovac and AstraZeneca.They are all two-dose vaccines, except the Janssen jab.The WHO is also on the verge of deciding whether to give emergency use listing (EUL) to India’s Bharat Biotech jab.SAGE held a four-day meeting last week to review the latest information and data on a range of vaccines for Covid-19 and other diseases.“SAGE recommended that moderately and severely immunocompromised persons should be offered an additional dose of all WHO EUL Covid-19 vaccines as part of an extended primary series,” the group said.“These individuals are less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary vaccine series and are at high risk of severe Covid-19 disease.”Kate O’Brien, the WHO’s vaccines chief, said the extra dose now should be considered as part of the normal coronavirus immunisation course for people with weaker immune systems, to be administered after a wait of one to three months.It should bring their level of protection up to that demonstrated to prevent against severe disease, hospitalisation and death in clinical trials — from which people with immunocompromised conditions were excluded.SAGE also said that for people fully immunised with Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines — both two-dose regimens — an additional third shot of the same jab “should be offered to persons aged 60 and above”.A different vaccine “may also be considered based on vaccine supply and access considerations”.SAGE added that when implementing this recommendation, countries should initially aim at maximising two-dose coverage in that population, and thereafter administer the third dose, starting in the oldest age groups.“We have evidence of a more limited protection in the old population, particularly in the very old,” SAGE secretary Joachim Hombach told a press conference.The Sinopharm jab is used in 69 countries, while Sinovac has been rolled out in 36, according to an AFP count.Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Pakistan and the Philippines are among the countries using both jabs, besides China.Most of the information on which the new Sinovac and Sinopharm recommendations were made comes from studies in Latin America, said SAGE chair Alejandro Cravioto.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-vaccines-for-kids-strategies-around-the-world/,Vaccines prevent severe Covid,1,"Pfizer on Thursday requested emergency approval from US health authorities to use its Covid jab in children aged five to 11.Here is a look at different approaches to vaccinating children against the virus and the debates it has launched around the world. Pfizer tested its jab on more than 2,000 US children aged five to 11 and submitted results to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval.The dosage for children in that age range is a third of what it is for adults: 0.1 mL rather than 0.3 mL.Pfizer and BioNTech say children in trials reacted well to the vaccine and that their immune response was “robust” and “comparable” to that observed in older adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 25.If the FDA grants authorisation when it convenes on October 26, children in that age range –- of whom there are some 28 million in the US — could start getting vaccinated by the end of the month.Are other countries doing this? While many countries have begun vaccinating adolescents aged 12 and older very few have extended jabs to children younger than that.On September 15 Cuba began administering doses of its Abdala and Soberana vaccines — which are not approved internationally — to children aged two to 11 years.Also in mid-September Cambodia began vaccinating kids aged six and up with the Chinese Sinovac jab.Sinovac has been approved for adults in more than 50 countries but before Cambodia only China had authorised its use in children over three.Sinovac has also launched clinical trials of its jab in 14,000 children aged six months to 17 years old in Chile, Kenya, Malaysia, the Philippines and in South Africa.In early August the United Arab Emirates started offering Sinopharm, another Chinese jab, to children aged three to 17.Venezuela announced in September that it would start vaccinating children and adolescents aged three to 18 in October.In Israel children aged five to 11 with complicating health factors — such as chronic lung illnesses, autoimmune diseases or neurological problems — have been able to get vaccinated since the end of July. Arnaud Fontanet, an epidemiologist advisor to the French government, told AFP that the major question is whether the risk posed by Covid to children in this age range outweighs the risk of potential jab side effects.For children in America the threat of severe Covid is elevated, he said.“The risk of hospitalisation for an infected child there is 10 times higher than for a child in western Europe,” he said, citing the prevalence of preexisting conditions like obesity and diabetes.Fontanet said that in southern US states where vaccination rates are low, paediatric services in hospitals are stretched thinly.The situation that could push US authorities to quickly approve jabs for younger children.Will more kids get jabs? The last few months have seen the World Health Organization (WHO) hammer home the importance of getting poorer adult populations vaccinated before extending jabs to children in rich countries.In its global vaccine strategy published on Thursday, the WHO said whether young children need to be get jabs depends on how the virus evolves and on proven vaccine safety in that age group.Fontanet says western European countries will be “much more hesitant” than the United States to lower the age range for vaccination.He cites current data that shows infections are relatively benign in children aged five to 11, even with the now-dominant Delta variant.Vaccination rates among the elderly are also rising, he added, which reduces the risk of that fragile population being contaminated by infections in young children.Fontanet also notes that parents of children in that age group tend to show more resistance to vaccines.“We always expect parents to be a little more hesitant,” he said.Getting millions of American children jabs means an opportunity to observe any side effects that may have escaped detection in clinical trials.“It’s really in our best interest to not rush and look at the data that will come from large-scale vaccination of children in the US,” Fontanet added.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pfizer-seeks-us-authorization-of-covid-vaccine-for-ages-5-11/,Pfizer seeks US authorization of Covid vaccine for ages 5-11,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — US drugmaker Pfizer said Thursday it has formally requested emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine in children age five to 11.Children have been infected in greater numbers in the latest coronavirus wave driven by the Delta variant, and inoculating young people is seen as key to keeping schools open and helping end the pandemic.In late September, Pfizer and BioNTech, the German biotechnology giant which co-developed the vaccine, began submitting data to Food and Drug Administration regulators for the highly anticipated authorization.Pfizer tweeted early Thursday that the two companies had “officially submitted our request” to the FDA “for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of our #COVID19 vaccine in children 5 to <12.”“We’re committed to working with the FDA with the ultimate goal of helping protect children against this serious public health threat,” Pfizer said.The FDA said last week it had scheduled a meeting of an advisory committee to review the data on October 26, before giving its opinion on whether authorization should be granted.The agency has previously said that once the formal submission was completed, it would complete its review “likely in a matter of weeks rather than months.”The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would subsequently publish recommendations for use for healthcare providers administering the shots.“If there is approval or authorization, and a CDC recommendation, we are ready, we have the supply,” White House Covid coordinator Jeff Zients told CNN following the announcement.“I think we can all agree that getting a safe and effective vaccine for kids five to 11 is a really important next step in our fight against the virus.”Children in the 5-11 age group received a two-dose regimen of 10 micrograms in the trial, compared with 30 micrograms for older age groups. The shots were given 21 days apart.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been granted full FDA approval for those age 16 and up, and the FDA in May authorized its emergency use in children age 12 to 15.Experts say children are essential to vaccinate to help achieve population immunity against the disease.While younger children are less likely to develop severe cases, they can still become sick and transmit the virus to the general population.“We’re working with states to set up convenient locations for parents and kids to get vaccinated, including pediatricians’ offices and community sites,” Zients said.Nearly 5.9 million children have tested positive for Covid-19 as of September 30, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.Vaccines, masks and other mitigation measures against Covid-19 have become deeply political issues in the United States — especially for children.California announced just last week that Covid vaccinations will be compulsory for all students, a first in the United States.About a third of parents with a child between the ages of 5 and 11 say they will vaccinate their kid as soon as possible, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey from the end of September.Another third say they will wait before making a decision, and a quarter say they will not get their child vaccinated.The Pfizer vaccine received full, formal approval in the US in August and is therefore technically available to children in younger age groups if prescribed by a doctor, but US authorities have cautioned against doing this until the safety data was in.Health officials are focusing in particular on the risk of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle that has been found to be more common in young adults and adolescents after vaccination, with an aim of determining whether benefits outweigh risks.Pfizer and BioNTech are also trialling their vaccine on infants aged six months to two years, and on children aged two to five.Initial data for these groups may come before the end of the year.The United States has an estimated 28 million children age five to 11, according to US Census Bureau data from 2019.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/bootleg-alcohol-kills-17-in-russia/,Bootleg alcohol kills 17 in Russia,1,"MOSCOW, Russia (AFP) — Seventeen people in Russia have died after drinking surrogate alcohol containing highly toxic methanol, officials said Friday, with investigators launching criminal probes.The deaths are the latest in Russia from the consumption of a cheap alcohol substitute, a persistent problem that authorities have previously said must be solved.An additional 16 people in the region of Orenburg, around 1,500 kilometres (930 miles) southeast of Moscow in the southern Urals, suffered alcohol poisoning.“As of now we know of 33 victims, 17 of whom have died,” the governor’s office said on the messaging app Telegram.Tests showed that the victims had consumed alcohol containing methanol, which unlike ethanol — the usual form of alcohol found in drinks — is highly toxic and can cause blindness even in very small doses.“In some cases, its concentration in the body was 3-5 times higher than the lethal dose,” the governor’s office said.A workshop distributing the surrogate alcohol was uncovered in the city of Orsk, and more than 1,200 bottles were confiscated, officials said.The consumption of spirits and household products containing alcohol is fairly common in Russia’s poorer regions and is blamed for a large number of alcohol-related deaths.Those who consume the products are usually the most socially disadvantaged.A team of narcologists and critical care physicians has been dispatched to the east of the Orenburg region where the deaths were registered.“All resources have been mobilised, including ventilators,” the governor’s office said.Governor Denis Pasler said that regional authorities had launched inspections of alcohol distributors.He asked residents to refrain from drinking until the checks were completed, describing it as “life-threatening”.The Orenburg branch of the Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes in Russia, said on Friday it had opened five probes after the deaths, including into the sale of goods not meeting safety standards.Three people were detained in connection with the deaths. One, a 29-year-old man from Orsk, is suspected of producing surrogate alcohol, investigators said in a statement.The fatalities come less than a year after seven people in Russia’s Far East republic of Yakutia died in November after consuming diluted hand sanitiser.The largest bootleg alcohol-related tragedy in recent memory was in 2016, when dozens of people died in the Siberian city of Irkutsk after drinking bath essence containing methanol, a toxic substance used in anti-freeze.After those deaths, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the tragedy required “very close attention.”Dmitry Medvedev, who was prime minister at the time, ordered the government to “sort out” the problem of selling alcoholic products not intended for drinking to impoverished alcoholics.© Agence France-Presse"

Sputnik V is already being used in countries including Algeria, Argentina, India, Iran, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Russia itself.“There are still the issues around complete information on the dossier that has to be provided by the applicant,” said Simao.“Then there is also the issues regarding the final finalisation of the inspections in the different manufacturers in Russia, but I’m happy to say that the about the process is about to be restarted.”In June, the WHO said it conducted nine inspections of Sputnik V manufacturing sites and uncovered various problems at the Pharmstandard Ufa Vitamin Plant in Ufa, southern Russia.Moscow insisted the problems had since been resolved.Russia is among the countries hardest-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with the fifth-highest number of recorded deaths according to an AFP tally on Thursday: 213,549 fatalities from 7,690,110 cases.Several Russian vaccines including Sputnik V have been available for months, but authorities have struggled to immunise a vaccine-sceptic population."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-recommends-use-of-first-malaria-vaccine-for-children/,WHO recommends use of first malaria vaccine for children,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization on Wednesday endorsed the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine, the first against the mosquito-borne disease that kills more than 400,000 people a year, mostly African children.The decision followed a review of a pilot programme deployed since 2019 in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi in which more than two million doses were given of the vaccine, first made by the pharmaceutical company GSK in 1987.After reviewing evidence from those countries, the WHO said it was “recommending the broad use of the world’s first malaria vaccine”, the agency’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.The WHO said it was recommending children in sub-Saharan Africa and in other regions with moderate to high malaria transmission get four doses up to the age of two.Every two minutes, a child dies of malaria, the agency said.More than half of malaria deaths worldwide are in six sub-Saharan African countries and almost a quarter are in Nigeria alone, according to 2019 WHO figures.Symptoms include fever, headaches and muscle pain, then cycles of chills, fever and sweating.Findings from the vaccine pilot showed it “significantly reduces severe malaria which is the deadly form by 30 percent,” said Kate O’Brien, Director of WHO’s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals.The vaccine is “feasible to deliver”, she added and “it’s also reaching the unreached… Two thirds of children who don’t sleep under a bed net in those countries are now benefiting from the vaccine.”Many vaccines exist against viruses and bacteria but this was the first time that the WHO recommended for broad use a vaccine against a human parasite.The vaccine acts against plasmodium falciparum — one of five malaria parasite species and the most deadly.“From a scientific perspective this is a massive breakthrough,” said Pedro Alonso, Director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme.Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa said Wednesday’s recommendation “offers a glimmer of hope for the continent which shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease.”The estimated cost of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa is over 12 billion dollars a year, Alonso said at a news conference following the announcement.Before the newly recommended vaccine can reach children in need, the next step will be funding.“That will be the next major step… Then we will be set up for scaling of doses and decisions about where the vaccine will be most useful and how it will be deployed,” said O’Brien.Gavi vaccine alliance said in a statement after the WHO announcement that “global stakeholders, including Gavi, will consider whether and how to finance a new malaria vaccination programme for countries in sub-Saharan Africa.”The fight against malaria received a boost in April when researchers from Britain’s Oxford University announced that their Matrix-M vaccine candidate had become the first to surpass the WHO’s threshold of 75-percent efficacy.Germany’s BioNTech, which developed a coronavirus vaccine with US giant Pfizer, also said it aimed to start trials for a malaria vaccine next year using the same breakthrough mRNA technology.The WHO also hopes this latest recommendation will encourage scientists to develop more malaria vaccines.The RTS,S/AS01 is “a first generation, really important one,” said Alonso, “but we hope… it stimulates the field to look for other types of vaccines to completement or go beyond this one.”© Agence France-Presse"

They have become like any normal child. The danger has disappeared,” he said.A United Nations medical flight had brought the babies and their parents to Jordan in February.Born in mid-December in Yemen’s rebel-held capital Sanaa, they were in critical condition.“When they arrived, they both weighed three kilograms and 700 grams (eight pounds). We waited until they weighed nine kilograms together” before separating them, Hammouri said.The babies are still in Jordan with their parents but expected to return home in two or three weeks, he added.Seven years of war between the Huthi rebels and pro-government forces have devastated health services in Yemen.About 80 percent of the country’s 30 million people, long the Arabian Peninsula’s poorest country, are dependent on aid.In February 2019, conjoined twins died in Sanaa two weeks after their birth.Conjoined twins develop when an early embryo only partially separates, to form two individuals who will remain physically connected, the Mayo Clinic says on its website.Many conjoined twins are stillborn or die shortly after birth, but advances in surgery and technology have improved survival rates.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/youtube-cracks-down-on-anti-vaccine-misinformation/,YouTube cracks down on anti-vaccine misinformation,1,"SAN FRANCISCO, United States (AFP) — YouTube announced Wednesday it would remove videos and some high-profile users that falsely claim approved vaccines are dangerous, as social networks seek to crack down on health misinformation around Covid-19 and other diseases.Video-sharing giant YouTube has already banned posts that spread false myths around coronavirus treatments, including ones that share inaccurate claims about Covid-19 vaccines shown to be safe. But the Google-owned site said its concerns about the spread of medical conspiracy theories went beyond the pandemic.“We’ve steadily seen false claims about the coronavirus vaccines spill over into misinformation about vaccines in general,” YouTube said in a statement.“We’re now at a point where it’s more important than ever to expand the work we started with Covid-19 to other vaccines.”A YouTube spokesperson said channels of several “well-known vaccine misinformation spreaders will be terminated,” naming Joseph Mercola and Sherri Tenpenny as well as a Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. affiliated channel.An AFP investigation found that Tenpenny runs a sprawling enterprise based on anti-vaccine activism, disdain for masks and testing, and denials that Covid-19 is real.Mercola, a Florida-based osteopathic physician, was the subject of a New York Times article titled: “The most influential spreader of coronavirus misinformation online”.While Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had already been blocked from Instagram in February for spreading misinformation about Covid-19 and vaccines. YouTube said the expanded policy will apply to “currently administered vaccines that are approved and confirmed to be safe and effective by local health authorities and the WHO (World Health Organization).”It will see false claims about routine immunizations for diseases like measles and Hepatitis B removed from YouTube. These would include cases where vloggers have claimed that approved vaccines do not work, or wrongly linked them to chronic health effects.Content that “falsely says that approved vaccines cause autism, cancer or infertility, or that substances in vaccines can track those who receive them” will also be taken down.“As with any significant update, it will take time for our systems to fully ramp up enforcement,” YouTube added.It stressed there would be exceptions to the new guidelines, with personal testimonials of negative experiences with vaccines still allowed, so long as “the channel doesn’t show a pattern of promoting vaccine hesitancy.”YouTube said it had removed more than 130,000 videos since last year for violating its Covid-19 vaccine policies.On Tuesday, the company told German media that it had blocked the German-language channels of Russia’s state broadcaster RT for violating its Covid misinformation guidelines.YouTube said it had issued a warning to RT before shutting the two channels down, but the move has prompted a threat from Moscow to block the video site.It is not the only social media giant grappling with how to deal with the spread of Covid-19 conspiracy theories and medical misinformation in general. Facebook this month launched a renewed effort to tackle extremist and conspiracy groups, beginning by taking down a German network spreading Covid misinformation."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/turn-the-page-on-covid-19-not-so-fast-say-experts/,Turn the page on Covid-19? Not so fast,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — With global Covid cases declining and pandemic fatigue on the rise, many countries are easing restrictions put in place to block the spread of the virus.But it’s far too soon to declare victory, say experts, who warn that unequal vaccine access could still lead to the emergence of new and more deadly variants of the virus.On September 14 the World Health Organization (WHO) announced “the first substantial decline in weekly [Covid] cases in more than two months” after new infections during the week of September 6 totalled four million.That number fell again the following week to 3.6 million as did the number of deaths, to “just under 60,000”, the WHO said in its most recent update this week.In Europe — where a large percentage of adults are now vaccinated — the pandemic seems to be waning after spikes of infections caused by the Delta variant.“I believe that most of the world (including most of Europe and the Americas) is entering the final phase of the pandemic,” Francois Balloux of the University College of London tweeted last week.“There will be outbreaks over the coming months/years but I don’t anticipate Covid-19 waves comparable to those we’ve experienced over the last 18 months.”Epidemiologist Mircea Sofonea, a specialist on the evolution of infectious diseases at the University of Montpellier, said Covid is spreading differently now, especially in Europe.“We are seeing the transition from a wave pattern to more scattered spikes that aren’t as high,” he told AFP.This improvement has emboldened several European countries to end some or even all pandemic-related restrictions, as Denmark did on September 10.“We will know in two or three weeks whether the results of Denmark’s experiment are positive or not,” epidemiologist Antoine Flahault told AFP.He said that what happens in Denmark will determine “whether we can encourage other European countries to lift the widespread use of health passes and even mask-wearing without risking a new spike in the pandemic.”“The measures could always be reinstated if infections go up again,” he added.So is the pandemic in its final phase?“I think it is too early to say just yet for everyone, though in the highly vaccinated parts of the world, this will be more true,” virologist Julien Tang told AFP by email.For now, he said, statements about how the pandemic is progressing “have to be very country- or region-specific”.“There are now clear inequalities in terms of vaccination coverage across the world,” Tang said.Less than two percent of the world’s poorest populations have received even a first dose of vaccine, noted Flahault, director of the University of Geneva’s Institute of Global Health.“In certain places — eastern and central Europe, Africa, Asia, Israel, Canada, El Salvador, Belize — cases are increasing exponentially, so we can’t say the pandemic is behind us,” he said.Even in rich, well-vaccinated countries showing a downward trend, things could reverse, experts caution.As the northern hemisphere approaches winter, people will once again gravitate toward large, indoor gatherings that boost circulation of the virus.“We have to be careful of the situation in Europe and North America as we enter the middle of autumn,” says Sofonea.“What we know about this pandemic is that it is unpredictable,” added Flahault.“No one foresaw the appearance of the Delta variant in India last spring, even though we feared that kind of thing might happen.”The highly contagious Delta variant is now dominant across the world.Although vaccines are less effective at impeding its spread, they still work very well in preventing hospitalisation and death.But that could change.“If a mutation of the Delta variant made it more resistant to existing vaccines, it could reverse the improvement we are currently seeing,” Flahault said.Since a huge proportion of the population of poor countries is not vaccinated, it is likely that major spikes in infections could cause new variants to emerge, he added.“As long as the virus is circulating at a high rate somewhere in the world, we won’t be safe from new waves,” Flahault said.“Right now for world safety we must vaccinate as many people on Earth as possible.”© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-says-air-pollution-kills-7-million-a-year-toughens-guidelines/,US biotech billionaire to make Covid,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization strengthened its air quality guidelines on Wednesday, saying air pollution was now one of the biggest environmental threats to human health, causing seven million premature deaths a year.Urgent action is needed to reduce exposure to air pollution, said the UN body, ranking its burden of disease on a par with smoking and unhealthy eating.“WHO has adjusted almost all the air quality guideline levels downwards, warning that exceeding the new… levels is associated with significant risks to health,” it said.“Adhering to them could save millions of lives.”The guidelines aim to protect people from the adverse effects of air pollution and are used by governments as a reference for legally binding standards.The UN health agency last issued air quality guidelines, or AQGs, in 2005, which had a significant impact on pollution abatement policies worldwide.In the 16 years since however, the WHO said more evidence had emerged showing that air pollution effected health at lower concentrations than previously understood.“The accumulated evidence is sufficient to justify actions to reduce population exposure to key air pollutants, not only in particular countries or regions but on a global scale,” the organisation said.The new guidelines come just in time for the COP26 global climate summit held in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12.The WHO said that alongside climate change, air pollution was one of the biggest environmental threats to human health.Its climate change chief Maria Neira said the WHO was preparing a major report to present in Glasgow to stress the “enormous health benefits” of reducing air pollution through mitigating climate change.“You can imagine the incredible number of lives we will save,” she told journalists.The new WHO guidelines recommend lower air quality levels for six pollutants, including ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide.The other two are PM10 and PM2.5 — particulate matter equal or smaller than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter.Both can penetrate deep into the lungs but researchers say PM2.5 can even enter the bloodstream, causing mainly cardiovascular and respiratory problems, but also affecting other organs, said the WHO.In response, the PM2.5 guideline level has been halved.In 2019, more than 90 percent of the world’s population lived in areas where concentrations exceeded the 2005 AQG for long-term PM2.5 exposure, with southeast Asia the worst-affected region.“Almost everyone around the world is exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.“Inhaling dirty air increases the risk of respiratory diseases like pneumonia, asthma… and increases the risk of severe Covid-19.”Air quality markedly improved since the 1990s in high-income countries, the WHO noted. But the global toll in deaths and lost years of healthy life barely declined because air quality deteriorated in most other countries, in line with their economic development.“Every year, exposure to air pollution is estimated to cause seven million premature deaths and result in the loss of millions more healthy years of life,” the WHO said.In children, this could mean reduced lung growth and function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma.In adults, ischaemic heart disease — also called coronary heart disease — and strokes are the most common causes of premature death attributable to outdoor air pollution.The evidence since 2005 showed how air pollution affected “all parts of the body, from the brain to a growing baby in a mother’s womb”, said Tedros.Evidence is also emerging of other effects such as diabetes and neurodegenerative conditions, said the organisation.Professor Alastair Lewis, of Britain’s National Centre for Atmospheric Science, said the guidelines “dramatically increase the scale of challenge to society” in cutting air pollution.But he said the PM2.5 guidelines were “the most contentious” as they come from natural sources too — even from cooking — and can stay airborne for weeks.“PM2.5 is, to an extent, also an inevitable and unavoidable consequence of living a 21st-century life,” said Lewis.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/delta-overwhelming-other-covid-variants-of-concern-who/,cancer vaccines in S.Africa,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — Delta has all but elbowed out the three other Covid-19 variants of concern, which now represent a tiny fraction of the samples being sequenced, the WHO said Tuesday.“Less than one percent each of Alpha, Beta and Gamma are currently circulating. It’s really predominantly Delta around the world,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization’s technical lead on Covid-19.Delta “has become more fit, it is more transmissible and it is out-competing, it is replacing the other viruses that are circulating,” she told a WHO social media live interaction, adding that Delta had been detected in more than 185 countries to date.All viruses mutate over time, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19 disease.During late 2020, the emergence of variants that posed an increased risk to global public health prompted the WHO to start characterising them as variants of interest, and the more-worrying variants of concern, to inform the response to the pandemic.The UN health agency decided to name the variants after the letters of the Greek alphabet, to avoid the countries that first detected them being stigmatised.Besides the four variants of concern, there are also five variants of interest, but Van Kerkhove said three of them — Eta, Iota and Kappa — were now being downgraded to variants under monitoring.“This is really due to changes in circulation and that the variants of interest are just out-competed by the variants of concern. They’re just not taking hold,” she said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/johnson-johnson-announces-positive-covid-booster-data/,WHO says air pollution kills 7 million a year,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine is more effective when given as a two-dose regime, according to new data released by the company on Tuesday.A second shot given 56 days after the first provided 75 percent protection against symptomatic Covid in a global clinical trial, with that level rising to 94 percent in the United States.The reason behind this difference was not clear from the company’s press release, but it could be linked to fewer variants in the US when the data accrued.It was 94 percent effective in preventing severe or critical Covid at least 14 days post final vaccination in America — but there were relatively few cases to judge from.When a second shot was given two months after the first, antibody levels rose to four to six times higher than observed after the single dose.Overall, the data is positive news for the almost 15 million Americans who received one dose of the J&J vaccine but have been left in the dark about if and when they might need a booster.President Joe Biden’s administration in August announced plans for Americans vaccinated with mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) to get third shots.An expert panel convened by the Food and Drug Administration last week greenlighted Pfizer boosters for the elderly, high-risk, and those in high-risk occupations, and decisions on Moderna are expected to follow.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said it expects a second dose of the J&J vaccine will be required, but that it needs more data before making a firm recommendation.J&J’s new announcement might help inform that strategy. The company said it had provided data to the FDA and other regulatory agencies.It also said that when a booster was given six months after the first shot, “antibody levels increased nine-fold one week after the booster and continued to climb to 12-fold higher four weeks after the booster,” irrespective of age.In a separate study of 390,000 US people who received the J&J vaccine from March to July 2021, efficacy of a single J&J shot was 79 percent against infection and 81 percent against hospitalization.The estimates for efficacy against hospitalization were higher than those found in two recent studies by the CDC, one of which estimated 68 percent while the other estimated it was 60 percent.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pfizer-says-its-covid-jab-safe-for-children-aged-5-11/,toughens guidelines,1,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AFP) — Pfizer and BioNTech on Monday said trial results showed their coronavirus vaccine is safe and produces a robust immune response in children aged five to 11, adding that they would seek regulatory approval shortly.The vaccine would be administered at a lower dosage than for people over 12, they said.“In participants five to 11 years of age, the vaccine was safe, well tolerated and showed robust neutralising antibody responses,” US giant Pfizer and its German partner said in a joint statement.They plan to submit their data to regulatory bodies in the European Union, the United States and around the world “as soon as possible”.Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University School of Public Health and a leading Covid expert in the US, called it the “good news” many parents had been waiting for.If all goes well and approval follows, “my 9-year will get a shot by Halloween!” he tweeted.The trial results are the first of their kind for children under 12, with a Moderna trial for 6-11 year olds still ongoing.Both the Pfizer and Moderna jabs are already being administered to adolescents over 12 in several countries, as well as to adults around the globe.England, Scotland and Wales became the latest to join the list of nations vaccinating younger teenagers, rolling out jabs for 12 to 15 year-olds this week. Northern Ireland is to follow suit next month.Although children are considered less at risk of severe Covid, there are concerns that the highly contagious Delta variant could lead to more serious cases.Innoculating children is also seen as key to keeping schools open and helping end the pandemic.“We are eager to extend the protection afforded by the vaccine to this younger population,” said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, noting that “since July, paediatric cases of COVID-19 have risen by about 240 percent in the US”.Kids in the 5-11 age group received a two-dose regimen of 10 microgrammes in the trial, compared with 30 microgrammes for older age groups, the companies said. The shots were given 21 days apart.The 10 microgramme dose was “carefully selected as the preferred dose for safety, tolerability and immunogenicity” for that age group, the statement said.The side effects were “generally comparable to those observed in participants 16 to 25 years of age”, it added.Among the most commonly reported side effects in the past have been pain and swelling at the injection site as well as headache, chills and fever.The Pfizer-BioNTech statement made no mention of the rare side effect of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle that has been linked to the vaccine, mostly among younger males.The Pfizer vaccine received full, formal approval in the US in August and is therefore technically available to younger children if prescribed by a doctor, but US authorities have cautioned against doing this until the safety data was in.The US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said in a statement earlier this month it would “carefully” review emergency authorisation requests for vaccines for under -12s, a process it expected to take “weeks rather than months”.Israel has already given special authorisation to vaccinate children aged 5-11 who are “at significant risk of serious illness or death” from Covid, using the Pfizer jab at the lower dosage.Pfizer and BioNTech are also trialling their vaccine on infants aged six months to two years, and on children aged two to five.The topline results for those trials are expected “as soon as” the fourth quarter of this year, the companies said.All together, up to 4,500 children aged six months to 11 years have enrolled in the Pfizer-BioNTech trials in the US, Finland, Poland and Spain.Like its Moderna rival, the Pfizer jab is based on novel mRNA technology that delivers genetic instructions to cells to build the coronavirus spike protein, in order to evoke antibodies when bodies encounter the real virus.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-panel-recommends-covid-boosters-for-people-65-and-older/,Delta overwhelming other Covid variants of concern: WHO,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — A panel of leading US medical experts advising the government voted in favor of authorizing boosters of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine for everyone aged 65 and up, as well as people at high risk of developing severe Covid.The same committee however rejected an initial proposal, submitted by Pfizer and backed by President Joe Biden’s administration, to fully approve boosters to everyone aged 16 and over.The decisions came after a day-long meeting full of data presentations and at times charged debate that was convened by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Tens of millions of Americans will soon be eligible for a third shot.“I think this should demonstrate to the public that the members of this committee are independent of the FDA, and that in fact we do bring our voices to the table,” said Archana Chatterjee, dean of Chicago Medical School.The panel — which included vaccinologists, infectious disease researchers, and epidemiologists — concluded that the benefit-risk balance differed for younger people, especially males at risk for myocarditis.A clinical trial for the booster involved just over 300 people, which they felt was too small to be able to draw firm conclusions about safety.The panel voted 16-2 against granting a third dose full approval.They were then presented with a new motion, and voted 18-0 for granting emergency authorization for people aged over 65 and those at high risk. They agreed this should extend to health care workers and people at high risk of occupational exposure.Now the issue turns to another committee, this time convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on September 22-23 to further define who is eligible and decide on rollout.Pfizer will work with the FDA to address the committee’s questions as “we continue to believe in the benefits of a booster dose for a broader population,” Kathrin Jansen, head of vaccine research and development at the company, said in a statement. Even prior to the meeting, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had struck a cautious note.In its briefing document, the FDA stated: “Data indicate that currently US-licensed or authorized Covid-19 vaccines still afford protection against severe Covid-19 disease and death.”Two senior FDA officials meanwhile co-signed a Viewpoint in The Lancet this week opposing boosters for the general population, in what was seen as a rebuke of the White House for taking a decision before consulting its scientific agencies, effectively placing the cart before the horse.At the meeting, Pfizer officials cited studies that demonstrated waning immunity against infection several months out from the first two doses.“The demonstrated safety and effectiveness of a third dose support adding a booster dose to the vaccination schedule,” said Donna Boyce, Pfizer’s senior vice president of global regulatory affairs.But a growing body of US research — including a dataset presented by Pfizer itself at Friday’s meeting — has shown two doses continue to confer high protection against severe outcomes, albeit at slightly diminished levels for the elderly.Pfizer also presented data showing boosters increased antibody levels against the Delta variant, but an FDA scientist countered that these lab studies could not translate directly to efficacy estimates.Sharon Alroy Preis, an official with Israel’s health ministry, presented data from her country which ran a booster campaign after experiencing a Delta wave, and has approved boosters for everyone aged 12 and up.Jay Portnoy, a pediatrician with Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, said the Israeli experience should serve as a warning beacon and that the United States should follow its lead.But most of the panel did not see the two countries as closely analogous. Because the US has a much lower overall vaccination rate, the unvaccinated are the primary drivers of spread, rather than breakthrough cases among the vaccinated."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/surprise-may-be-key-to-mozart-effect-on-epilepsy-study/,Johnson & Johnson announces positive Covid booster data,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — A Mozart sonata that can calm epileptic brain activity may get its theraputic power thanks to melodies that create a sense of surprise, according to a study published Thursday.The research on 16 patients hospitalized with epilepsy that did not respond to medication has bolstered hopes that music could be used for new non-invasive treatments.“Our ultimate dream is to define an ‘anti-epileptic’ music genre and use music to improve the lives of those with epilepsy,” said Robert Quon of Dartmouth College who co-authored the study published in Scientific reports.Mozart’s Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major K448 is known for its effects on cognition and other brain activity, but researchers are still seeking to understand why.In this study, scientists played the piece for patients equipped with brain implant sensors to monitor the occurrence of IEDs — brief but harmful brain events suffered by epileptics between seizures.They found IEDs decreased after 30 seconds of listening, with significant effects in parts of the brain associated with emotion.When they compared the response to the structure of the work, they found the effects increased during transitions between longer musical phrases — ones that lasted ten seconds or more.Quon says the findings suggest that longer phrases may create a sense of anticipation — and then answer it in an unexpected way “creating a positive emotional response”.The so-called ‘Mozart effect’ has been the subject of research since scientists in 1993 claimed people who had listened to K448 for 10 minutes showed improved spatial reasoning skills.Subsequent research has has tested K448’s effects on various brain functions and disorders, including epilepsy.But the authors said this is the first to break down observations based on the song’s structure, which they described as “organised by contrasting melodic themes, each with its own underlying harmony”.As with previous studies, patients showed no change in brain activity when exposed to other auditory stimuli or pieces of music that were not K448 — even those from their preferred musical genres.The patients in this study listened to 90 seconds of a Wagner work characterised by changing harmonies but “no recognisable melody”.Listening to Wagner did not produce any calming effect, leading researchers to home in on melody as important in K448.The study notes further testing could use other carefully-selected pieces of music for comparison to further pinpoint the sonata’s theraputic components.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/ebola-virus-in-survivors-can-trigger-outbreaks-years-after-infection/,Pfizer says its Covid jab safe for children aged 5-11,1,"TOKYO, Japan (AFP) — Ebola survivors can relapse and trigger outbreaks at least five years after infection, and long-term follow-up of former patients is needed to prevent devastating flare-ups, according to new research.Scientists already knew Ebola could lie dormant in survivors, who test negative because the virus is in tissue rather than circulating in the blood.But analysis of an outbreak this year in Guinea, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, found these “virus reservoirs” can awaken and cause new infections and transmission years on.To trace the source of the Guinea outbreak, which involved 16 confirmed cases, 12 of whom died, researchers analysed the genomes of samples from several patients.Ebola outbreaks are usually thought to result from the virus “spilling” from an animal host to a human.But the analysis showed the Guinea strain was virtually identical to that from a 2013-16 wave.If the virus had been circulating actively in the community since then, it would have accumulated a certain number of mutations as it spread.Instead, the 2021 virus had just 12 changes, “far fewer than would be expected… during six years of sustained human-to-human transmission”.That strongly suggests the source was reactivated virus that had lain dormant in a survivor, said Alpha Keita, a researcher at the University of Montpellier who led the study.“This is the longest known time between the declared end of an epidemic and a viral resurgence,” he told AFP.“It’s a new paradigm: the possibility that transmission from an individual infected during a previous epidemic could be the source of a new outbreak.”How and why dormant Ebola virus suddenly awakens and sickens a person remains something of a mystery, though there are some tantalising clues.Sometimes a spike in Ebola antibodies can be detected in survivors at a given time — a possible sign that the body is responding to a resurgent virus.Around two-thirds of Ebola survivors have high antibody levels even five years after infection, but “the question to pose is what happens if there’s a resurgence in the people whose immunity has dropped”, said Keita.The study’s findings have “considerable implications for public health and care of survivors of Ebola”, said Robert F.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/no-need-for-a-vaccine-third-jab-booster-study/,US panel recommends Covid boosters for people 65 and older,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Vaccines are effective enough at preventing severe cases of Covid-19 that there is no current need for the general population to be given third doses, according to a report in The Lancet published Monday.Some countries have started offering extra doses over fears about the much more contagious Delta variant, causing the World Health Organization to call for a moratorium on third jabs amid concerns about vaccine supplies to poorer nations, where millions have yet to receive their first jab.The new report by scientists, including from the WHO, concluded that even with the threat of Delta, “booster doses for the general population are not appropriate at this stage in the pandemic”.The authors, who reviewed observational studies and clinical trials, found that vaccines remain highly effective against severe symptoms of Covid-19, across all the main virus variants including Delta, although they had lower success in preventing asymptomatic cases of the disease.“Taken as a whole, the currently available studies do not provide credible evidence of substantially declining protection against severe disease, which is the primary goal of vaccination,” said lead author Ana-Maria Henao-Restrepo, of the WHO.She said vaccine doses should be prioritised to people around the world still waiting for a jab.“If vaccines are deployed where they would do the most good, they could hasten the end of the pandemic by inhibiting further evolution of variants,” she added.Countries like France have started distributing third jabs to the elderly and people with compromised immune systems, while Israel has gone further, offering children 12 and older a third dose five months after receiving a second jab.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has called on countries to avoid giving out extra Covid jabs until the end of the year as the UN health agency urges all nations to vaccinate at least 10 percent of their populations by the end of this month, and at least 40 percent by the end of this year.The Lancet study concluded that the current variants had not developed sufficiently to escape the immune response provided by vaccines currently in use.The authors argue that if new virus mutations do emerge that are able to evade this response, it would be better to deliver specially modified vaccine boosters aimed at the newer variants, rather than a third dose of an existing vaccine.Commenting on the study Azra Ghani, Chair in Infectious Disease Epidemiology, at Imperial College London, described it as a “very thorough review” of current research.But she said that while the reduction in efficacy of vaccines against variants like Delta might be small, when considered across a population it could still lead to “a substantial increase” in people needing hospitalisation.“Even in the most developed countries, these small differences can put a severe strain on the health system,” she said in a statement to the Science Media Centre, adding there was no “one size fits all” approach to booster vaccines.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-vaccines-hold-up-against-severe-delta-us-data/,Surprise may be key to ‘Mozart effect’ on epilepsy: study,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Fully vaccinated people were 11 times less likely to die of Covid and 10 times less likely to be hospitalized compared to the unvaccinated since highly contagious Delta became the most common variant, US health authorities said Friday.The data came from one of three new papers published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all of which underscored Covid vaccines’ ongoing effectiveness against severe outcomes.For reasons that are not yet well understood, data from one of the studies suggests Moderna’s vaccine has offered a slightly higher level of protection in the Delta period.It comes a day after President Joe Biden announced an aggressive new immunization plan that includes requiring companies employing more than 100 people to either vaccinate their workers or test them weekly.“As we have shown in study after study, vaccination works,” said CDC director Rochelle Walenksy during a press briefing on Friday.The first study examined hundreds of thousands of cases in 13 US jurisdictions from April 4 – June 19, the period before Delta was dominant, and compared them to June 20 – July 17.Between these periods, a vaccinated person’s risk of Covid infection rose slightly: from being 11 times less likely to be infected compared to an unvaccinated person, to five times less likely.Protection against hospitalization and death remained more stable, but fell more among people aged 65 and above than for younger age groups.The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration are assessing the need for booster shots, and it is likely the elderly will be among the first to receive them when the Biden administration starts to roll them out later this month.One of the studies, which assessed vaccine effectiveness from June – August at more than 400 hospitals, emergency departments and urgent care clinics, stratified efficacy by brand.Efficacy against hospitalization was highest for Moderna at 95 percent; then Pfizer at 80 percent; and finally Johnson & Johnson at 60 percent.Overall efficacy against hospitalization was 86 percent for all age groups but this fell to 76 percent for those over 75.The two mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna, have always performed slightly better than the J&J adenovirus vector vaccine — possibly because the latter is administered as one dose.It isn’t clear why Moderna’s vaccine appears to have a slight edge on Pfizer in the Delta period.It could be linked to its higher dosing level of 100 micrograms versus 30 micrograms, or possibly the greater interval between the first and second shots (four versus three weeks), which might be associated with a heightened immune response. © Agence France-Presse"

Most mutations have little or no effect but some can influence properties of viruses including how easily they spread, the severity of the disease they cause, and their resistance to vaccines.The WHO currently identifies four Covid-19 variants of concern, including Alpha, which is present in 193 countries, and Delta, present in 170 countries.Five variants, including Mu, are to be monitored.After being detected in Colombia, Mu has since been reported in other South American countries and in Europe.The WHO said its global prevalence has declined to below 0.1 percent among sequenced cases. In Colombia, however, it is at 39 percent.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/co-inventor-of-mrna-shots-sets-sights-on-pan-coronavirus-vaccine/,Co-inventor of mRNA shots sets sights on pan-coronavirus vaccine,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Drew Weissman’s decades of research helped pave the way for mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, but the scientist isn’t resting on his laurels.The University of Pennsylvania immunologist, who on Thursday shared the $3 million 2022 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences with his longtime collaborator Katalin Kariko, is now spearheading efforts to design a new vaccine against all coronaviruses.The Silicon Valley-backed award honors major discoveries with the highest cash amounts in science.“There have been three (coronavirus) pandemics or epidemics in the past 20 years,” Weissman told AFP in an interview, referring to the original SARS virus, MERS and Covid-19.“You have to assume there’s going to be more, and our idea was that we could wait for the next coronavirus epidemic or pandemic, and then spend a year and a half making a vaccine. Or we could make one now and have it either ready to go, or use it now.”The 62-year-old and his team started work on the project last spring and have so far published two papers, with promising results.One of the vaccines was shown to prevent SARS and a few other animal coronaviruses that have the potential to cross into humans.By now, many are familiar with the basic principles of mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccines: they deliver genetic instructions to our cells to build the spike protein of the coronavirus, in order to evoke antibodies when our bodies encounter the real virus.The new focus is to try to train our immune systems to parts of the virus that do not mutate as fast as the spike. These are called “conserved regions.”As a practicing doctor for most of his life, “my dream since starting college and medical school was to make something that helps people,” Weissman said, adding it made him “incredibly happy” to see the vaccines he laid the groundwork for save lives.But while he foresaw the issue of global vaccine inequality — and is working on a project with the Thai government to develop their own Covid-19 vaccine for this reason — he admitted to being astonished by the level of vaccine hesitancy seen in wealthy countries.“The conservative anti-science, anti-government people completely surprised us. I just didn’t expect that group to come out against vaccines,” he said. While mRNA technology is enjoying huge attention, Weissman remembers a time when the field was a scientific backwater.“We started working together in 1998, and that was without much funding and without much in the way of publications,” he said of his work with Kariko.In 2005, they found a way to alter synthetic RNA to stop it from causing a massive inflammatory response found in animal experiments.“Just before our paper was published I said ‘Our phones are going to ring off the hook,'” he recalls.“We sat there staring at our phones for five years, and they never rang!”With a second big breakthrough in 2015, they found a new way to deliver the particles safely and effectively to their target cells, using a fatty coating called “lipid nanoparticles.”Both developments are part of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines today.Beyond vaccines, mRNA technology is also being heralded for its potential to revolutionize medicine.Weissman’s team is working on using RNA to develop a single-injection gene therapy to overcome the defect that causes sickle cell anemia, a genetic blood disease that 200,000 babies are born with in Africa every year.Significant technical challenges remain to ensure the treatment is able to correctly edit genes and is safe, but the researchers are hopeful.Bone marrow transplant, an expensive treatment with serious risks, is currently the only cure.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/enough-covid-vaccines-to-cover-global-population-industry/,Enough Covid vaccines to cover global population: industry,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — There will be enough Covid-19 vaccine doses produced by the end of this year to cover the global population, industry heavyweights said Tuesday.There is a yawning gap in vaccination rates between rich and poor countries, but the threshold of 7.5 billion vaccine doses will be reached in September, Thomas Cueni, the head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) told a news conference in Geneva.Up to 70 percent of adults have received two vaccine doses in richer nations while in Africa the figure is a mere six percent.About 1.5 billion doses are being manufactured every month, according to Airfinity, a scientific data analysis firm.The global production of coronavirus vaccine doses is projected to reach 12 billion by the end of 2021.This means that even if rich countries want to vaccinate everyone aged 12 and over, there will be at least 1.2 billion doses available for redistribution to poor countries, Airfinity said.“It also means that governments still holding back doses stocks in case of shortages no longer need to do so,” Cueni said.IFPMA said that the production of vaccine doses would reach 24 billion by the middle of next year — a figure it said was greater than global demand.Albert Bourla, head of US pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer, which makes a vaccine in collaboration with Germany’s BioNTech, said the cost of the jab was not an issue.He said his company priced the doses according to the economic strength of the country where it was being sold.Paul Stoffels, the scientific director of US drug maker Johnson & Johnson, said lifting patents, as demanded by some non-governmental organisations, was also not an issue currently.“At the moment it’s all about optimising existing manufacturing capacity of vaccines by those people who know how to produce,” he said.“If it takes us 18 months to get to upscaling manufacturing in existing plants… it will take different companies so much longer and so it doesn’t help.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/study-suggests-delta-does-not-cause-more-severe-childhood-covid/,Study suggests Delta does not cause more severe childhood Covid,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — US pediatric Covid hospitalizations have surged since Delta became predominant, but a new study that offers a first look at the relevant data suggests that fears the variant causes more severe disease are unfounded.The paper by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also found that between June 20 and July 31, 2021, unvaccinated adolescents were more than 10 times more likely to be hospitalized than those who were vaccinated.The health agency analyzed hospital records from across an area covering around 10 percent of the US population, between March 1, 2020 and August 14, 2021.This covered the period before the emergence of Delta, the most contagious strain to date, and after it became dominant, from June 20 onwards.Weekly hospitalizations of children aged 0-17 were at their lowest between June 12 and July 3, at 0.3 per 100,000, before rising to 1.4 per 100,000 in the week ending August 14 — a 4.7-fold increase.Pediatric hospitalizations reached their all-time peak of 1.5 per 100,000 in the week leading up to January 9, when the US experienced its winter wave that was driven by the Alpha variant.Consistent with prior research, children aged 12-17 and 0-4 are at higher risk of Covid hospitalization than those aged 5-11.After examining 3,116 hospital records from the period before Delta, and comparing them to 164 records during the Delta period, the percentage of children with severe indicators was found to not differ greatly.Specifically, the percent of hospitalized patients admitted to intensive care was 26.5 pre-Delta and 23.2 post; the percent placed on ventilators was 6.1 pre-Delta and 9.8 post; and the percent who died was 0.7 pre-Delta and 1.8 post.These differences did not rise to the level of statistical significance.The finding comes with the important caveat that because the number of hospitalizations in the post-Delta period is small, more data will need to accrue for scientists to gain greater confidence about the conclusion.The study also underscored vaccine effectiveness against pediatric Covid hospitalization during Delta.Between June 20 and July 31, among 68 adolescents hospitalized with Covid-19 whose vaccination status was known, 59 were unvaccinated, five were partly vaccinated, and four were fully vaccinated.This meant the unvaccinated were 10.1 times more likely to be hospitalized compared to vaccinated. A second study by the CDC examined childhood Covid cases, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits from June to August 2021, and compared them to the levels of community vaccination at the time.Covid-related pediatric (ages 0-17) emergency department visits and hospitalizations were 3.4 times higher and 3.7 times higher respectively in states that fell in the bottom quartile of overall vaccinated per capita, compared to states in the highest quartile.The takeaway message is that, while clinical trials for vaccines among those under the age of 12 and subsequent authorizations are awaited, high community rates of vaccination squelch Covid transmission and protect children."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/s-africa-scientists-monitoring-new-coronavirus-variant/,S.Africa scientists monitoring new coronavirus variant,1,"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AFP) — Scientists in South Africa are monitoring a new coronavirus variant with an unusually high mutation rate, and whose frequency has gradually increased in recent months, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases said Monday.The variant, known as C.1.2., was flagged last week by the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation and Sequencing Platform in a preprint study that has yet to be peer reviewed.While the majority of South Africa’s coronavirus cases are currently caused by the Delta variant — first detected in India — C.1.2. caught scientists’ attention because its mutation is almost twice as fast as observed in other global variants.Its frequency remains relatively low, however, and it has so far been detected in less than three percent of genomes sequenced since it was first picked up in May — although this has increased from 0.2 to two percent last month.NICD scientists on Monday said C.1.2. was only “present at very low levels” and that it was too early to predict how it might evolve.“At this stage we do not have experimental data to confirm how it reacts in terms of sensitivity to antibodies,” NICD researcher Penny Moore said during a virtual press briefing.But “we have considerable confidence that the vaccines that are being rolled out in South Africa will continue to protect us against severe illness and death,” she added.So far C.1.2 has been detected in all nine of South Africa’s provinces, as well as in other parts of the world including China, Mauritius, New Zealand and Britain.It is however not frequent enough to qualify as a “variant of interest” or a “variant of concern” such as the highly transmissible Delta and Beta variants, which emerged in South Africa late last year.South Africa is the continent’s hardest hit country with over 2.7 million Covid cases reported to date, of which at least 81,830 have been fatal.The Beta variant drove a second wave of infections in December and January, and the country is now grappling with a persistent third Delta-dominated wave predicted to overlap with a looming fourth. © Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/has-delta-killed-the-herd-immunity-dream/,Has Delta killed the herd immunity dream?,1,"As the Delta variant continues its global surge, experts are questioning whether the long-held goal of achieving herd immunity from Covid-19 through vaccination is still viable.Herd immunity is achieved when a certain threshold of the global population has either been inoculated against a pathogen or has recovered from infection.But whether or not it is achievable with Covid-19, with the regular emergence of more infectious strains, is up for debate.“If the question is ‘will vaccination alone allow us to dampen and control the pandemic?’ the answer is: no,” epidemiologist Mircea Sofonea told AFP.He said herd immunity hinged on two basic factors.“That’s the intrinsic infectiousness of the virus and the efficacy of vaccines to protect against infection. And at the moment, that efficacy isn’t there.”Delta has shown to be roughly 60 percent more transmissible than the Alpha variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and up to twice as infectious as the original strain that emerged in late 2019.The more effective the virus becomes at infecting people, the higher the herd immunity threshold becomes.“Theoretically, it’s a very simple calculation to make,” said epidemiologist Antoine Flahault.For the original virus, which had a reproduction rate between zero and three — meaning each infected person infects up to three others — herd immunity could have been achieved with around 66 percent of people immunised, Flahault told AFP.“But if the reproduction rate is eight, as with Delta, that puts us closer to 90 percent,” he said.Were vaccines 100 percent effective at stopping Delta infections, that 90 percent could conceivably be possible. Unfortunately, they aren’t. According to data published this week by US authorities, the efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines at preventing infection has fallen from 91 percent to 66 percent since Delta became the dominant variant.And studies have shown that the vaccine efficacy against infection with Delta falls over time — one of the reasons why several countries are now readying for an autumn third shot, or “booster”, vaccination campaign.With all this taken into account, absent other health measures such as mask-wearing or social distancing, Sofonea said it would take more than 100 percent of people to be vaccinated in order to guarantee transmissions end — an obvious impossibility.“The Delta variant will still infect people who have been vaccinated and that does mean that anyone who’s still unvaccinated, at some point, will meet the virus,” Andrew Pollard, director of Britain’s Oxford Vaccine Group, told lawmakers this month. But even if, as Pollard termed it, the “mythical” aim of herd immunity is no longer in play, experts stressed that getting vaccinated remained paramount.As with vaccines against other, now-endemic diseases such as measles and influenza, the Covid vaccines offer excellent protection against severe illness.“What scientists are recommending is to get the maximum number of people protected” through vaccination, said Flahault.Eventually, of course, all pandemics end.Sofonea said it would still be possible that Covid would become another endemic disease over time, “just not with vaccines alone”.He envisioned a near future where “masks and social distancing continue in certain regions” in order to limit transmission and, ultimately, severe illness.“During the AIDS pandemic, when scientists said we needed to wear condoms, lots of people said: ‘OK, we’ll do it for a while’,” said Flahault.“And in the end they kept on using them. It could well be that we will continue using masks in enclosed spaces and on transport for quite some time.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-delta-doubles-hospital-risk-vs-alpha-variant/,Covid: Delta doubles hospital risk vs Alpha variant,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — The Delta variant of the virus that causes Covid-19 doubles the risk of hospitalization compared to the Alpha variant it has supplanted as the dominant strain worldwide, researchers reported Saturday in The Lancet.Only 1.8 percent of the more than 43,000 Covid cases assessed in comparing the two variants were in patients who had been fully vaccinated.Three-quarters were completely unvaccinated, and 24 percent had only received one jab of a two-dose vaccine.“The results from this study therefore primarily tell us about the risk of hospital admission for those who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated,” said co-lead author Anne Presanis, a Senior Statistician at the University of Cambridge’s MRC Biostatistics Unit.Researchers analysed healthcare data from 43,338 COVID-19 cases in England from March 29 to May 23 of this year, including vaccination status, emergency care, hospital admission and other patient information.All virus samples underwent whole-genome sequencing, the surest way to confirm which variant had caused the infection.Just under 80 percent of the cases were identified as the Alpha variant, and the rest were Delta.Around one in 50 patients were admitted to hospital within 14 days of their first positive COVID-19 test.After accounting for factors that are known to affect susceptibility to severe illness — including age, ethnicity, and vaccination status — the researchers found the risk of being admitted to hospital was more than doubled with the Delta variant.Since these samples were taken, Delta has surged and now accounts for over 98 percent of new Covid-19 cases in Britain, the authors said.Multiple studies have shown that full vaccination prevents infection with symptoms and hospitalisation, for both Alpha and Delta variants.“We already know that vaccination offers excellent protection against Delta,” said Gavin Dabrera, another lead author and a consultant epidemiologist at the National Infection Service, Public Health England.“It is vital that those who have not received two doses of vaccine do so as soon as possible.”An earlier study from Scotland also reported a doubling in hospitalization risk with Delta over Alpha, suggesting that Delta causes more severe disease.The Delta variant was first reported in India in December 2020 and early studies found it to be up to 50 percent more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which was first identified in England in September last year.Nearly 4.5 million deaths worldwide have been attributed to Covid-19, though the final tally is likely to be higher once “excess deaths” are calculated over the pandemic period.In some countries — and some states in the United States — hospitalization and death rates are the highest they have been since the first cases reported at the beginning of 2020.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/malaria-trial-shows-70-reduction-in-severe-cases/,Malaria trial shows 70% reduction in severe cases,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — A new approach using existing medicines to prevent malaria has been shown to reduce severe cases of parasitic disease among infants by more than 70 percent in sub-Saharan Africa, according to a study.The “dramatic” results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, came from combining booster shots of an antimalarial vaccine ahead of the rainy season together with preventative drugs.Malaria kills more than 400,000 people a year, the vast majority under the age of five.The paper’s senior author Brian Greenwood of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told AFP that members of the team were in touch with the World Health Organization about updating its recommendations.The RTS,S vaccine, made by British pharmaceutical company GSK, was developed more than 20 years ago but by itself is not highly effective, said Greenwood.Prior research has shown the vaccine’s protection wanes over time and it offers around 30 percent efficacy over a period of three to four years.Since malaria is highly seasonal in the Sahel and sub-Sahel region, the team wanted to test whether giving boosters before each year’s rainy season, when mosquito populations peak, would improve outcomes.The trial followed around 6,000 children aged five to 17 months from Burkina Faso and Mali over the course of three years.The children were split into three groups: those who received only the anti-malarial drugs sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine and amodiaquine; those who received only the RTS,S vaccine; and those who received a combination.The combination was the most effective intervention, reducing malaria cases by 63 percent, hospitalizations by 71 percent, and deaths by 73 percent compared to the drugs alone.“That was pretty dramatic,” said Greenwood — stressing that these numbers are on top of the impact of the already effective drugs, not compared to no medicine, which would have been unethical to test.He estimated that the combination of the booster vaccine doses and antimalarial drugs reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 90 percent compared to no intervention.Children initially receive three doses of the vaccine to prime their systems, then a booster every year. It is based on a particle that trains the immune system against the Plasmodium falciparum parasite.The anti-malarial drugs are given for three days a month every four months.Greenwood said the study showed the value of developing plans in accordance with local epidemiological conditions — in this case administering vaccines ahead of peak season, instead of during times when there was no transmission and their impact would fade.“Like a lot of these things it’s sort of common sense but nobody has actually put this into practice, to see whether it actually would work,” he said.“Hopefully this may get implemented in several countries and save lots of people’s lives.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/vaccine-protection-of-pfizer-astrazeneca-wanes-within-6-months-phone-app-study/,Vaccine protection of Pfizer,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — Protection from two doses of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines wanes within less than six months, according to a study of phone app data Wednesday, suggesting that booster shots may be needed to ensure prolonged coverage.The latest finding comes as several countries are rolling out additional jabs for the fully vaccinated, a move slammed by the World Health Organization as millions in the world have yet to receive a single dose.The Pfizer jab was 88 percent effective a month after the second dose, but protection fell to 74 percent after five to six months, according to the latest analysis of data from the Zoe Covid Study.The study uses real-world data gathered via a mobile phone app with over a million active users, who log details on their vaccinations and test results, which is then analysed by researchers including scientists at King’s College London.The study drew on more than 1.2 million test results and participants.Protection from the AstraZeneca vaccine fell from 77 percent one month after a second dose to 67 percent after four to five months.The lead scientist on the Zoe app, Professor Tim Spector, said that more data was needed on how vaccine effectiveness changes in different age groups.UK cases grew sharply after social restrictions lifted in July but hospitalisations have been stable for the last month.But Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, warned that waning vaccine effectiveness among the most vulnerable could lead to more hospitalisations and deaths by winter.“In my opinion, a reasonable worst-case scenario could see protection below 50 percent for the elderly and healthcare workers by winter,” he said.If high levels of infection remain, fuelled by the more transmissible Delta variant and easing of restrictions, “this scenario could mean increased hospitalisations and deaths”, the scientist said.“We urgently need to make plans for vaccine boosters,” Spector added.He also said the UK needed to decide whether its current focus on vaccinating children was “sensible if our aim is to reduce deaths and hospital admissions”.The latest findings come after another study by University of Oxford scientists published last week found that the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine declines faster than that of AstraZeneca.The UK began vaccinating older or clinically vulnerable people in December last year, so these make up most of the people who have been fully vaccinated for half a year and are now likely to be at increased risk of infection."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-19-cases-in-seattle-area-increase-regardless-of-vaccination-status/,AstraZeneca wanes within 6 months: phone app study,1,"(Eagle News) — Nearly a year and a half has passed since the world went into lockdown to slow the transmission of Covid-19. Even though vaccines have been developed to help protect individuals, the virus mutated to the ‘Delta variant.’ This variant’s impact is being felt in the Seattle area, a place some consider as ground zero of the Covid-19 infections in the U.S.According to the Washington State Department of Health, “the Delta variant causes more infections and spreads than earlier forms of the virus that causes Covid-19.” Those who are not vaccinated are most vulnerable to the Delta variant and even the fully vaccinated are still at risk of contracting this new variant.Like many, those in the Seattle, Washington Area, wonder how the Delta variant has affected the region. What percentage of the population of three counties of the Greater Seattle area have been vaccinated? How many positive cases, hospitalization and death rates are there? How can a person be protected from the Delta variant?In King County, 65.8% of residents over the age of 12 have received and completed their vaccinations which equates to 1,487,558 individuals as mentioned from the county’s website.In Pierce County, 56.1% of females and 45.0% of males across all age groups have been fully or partially vaccinated.In Snohomish County 64% of residents over the age of 12 are fully vaccinated via the Snohomish Health District’s website.When it comes to positive cases deriving from COVID-19 and the Delta variant, cases are increasing daily regardless of vaccination status.As of this publication, the Washington State Department of Health reports in King County there are 124,891 positive cases, 6,975 hospitalizations and 1,693 deaths. In Pierce County, there are 64,121 cases, 3,945 hospitalizations and 673 deaths. In Snohomish County, positive cases are at 45,981 with 2,810 hospitalizations and 632 deaths.According to the Washington Department of Health, King and Pierce counties increased from 300% to 599% while Pierce County’s cases have risen to 100% to 299% across all age groups. It is estimated that one in 179 Washington residents have a Covid-19 infection.In light of the Delta variant’s impact, the Centers for Disease and Control (CDC) continues to release recommendations on how to be protected from Covid-19. The CDC recommends all individuals to be fully vaccinated and to wear masks in areas of high transmission such as public indoor places.Children two years and older are strongly encouraged to also wear a mask.Social distancing up to six feet apart from people who are not within your household for all indoor and outdoor activities is also recommended.The CDC also encourages the washing of hands often for 20 seconds or longer. If soap and water are not available the use a hand sanitizer with a minimum of 60% alcohol is recommended.Other precautions are to avoid crowded areas and poorly ventilated places and to cover your coughs and sneezes.Using cleaners and disinfectants that are proven to kill the Coronavirus will also help in the spread of COVID-19 for high touch areas.Lastly, the CDC recommends that all individuals monitor their symptoms carefully and daily for any signs of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.Even though vaccines have provided an additional layer of protection against Covid-19, like what the statistics show in the Greater Seattle Area, the Delta variant is a threat that all should be taking seriously."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/astrazeneca-hails-trial-results-for-covid-treatment/,AstraZeneca hails trial results for Covid treatment,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — Drug firm AstraZeneca on Friday announced positive results from a trial of a treatment for Covid-19 symptoms.The drug, made from a combination of two antibodies, was initially developed as a treatment for those who had already been exposed to the disease.A new trial of 5,197 participants who had not been exposed showed a 77-percent reduced risk of developing symptomatic disease, with no severe cases recorded, Astra said in a statement.A previous trial of the AZD7442 drug had shown it only reduced the risk of developing symptoms by 33 percent, which it concluded in June was not statistically significant.The data show that one dose could “quickly and effectively prevent symptomatic Covid-19”, said Myron Levin, principal trial investigator.“With these exciting results, AZD7442 could be an important tool in our arsenal to help people who may need more than a vaccine to return to their normal lives.”It is hoped that the drug could be used alongside vaccines for those who need more protection, affording up to 12 months of defence.Participants in the trial were adults who were poor responders or intolerant to vaccines, or who had increased risk of infection because of their locations or circumstances.The US government has funded the development of AZD7442 and has agreements to receive 700,000 doses.The company will now send the data to health authorities for potential emergency use authorisation or conditional approval.AstraZeneca already makes the most widely offered vaccine in the UK, although those under 40 are offered Pfizer or Moderna instead because of concerns over possible side effects."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pfizer-covid-jab-declines-faster-than-astrazeneca-study/,Pfizer Covid jab declines faster than AstraZeneca: study,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against Covid-19 declines faster than that of the AstraZeneca jab, according to a new study published on Thursday.“Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech have greater initial effectiveness against new COVID-19 infections, but this declines faster compared with two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca,” researchers at Oxford University said.The study, which has not been peer reviewed, is based on the results of a survey by Britain’s Office for National Statistics that carried out PCR tests from December last year to this month on randomly selected households.It found that “the dynamics of immunity following second doses differed significantly” between Pfizer and AstraZeneca, according to the university’s Nuffield Department of Medicine.Pfizer had “greater initial effectiveness” but saw “faster declines in protection against high viral burden and symptomatic infection”, when looking at a period of several months after full vaccination, although rates remained low for both jabs.“Results suggest that after four to five months effectiveness of these two vaccines would be similar,” the scientists added, while stressing that long-term effects need to be studied.The study’s findings come as Israel is administering booster shots, after giving 58 percent of the population two shots of the Pfizer jab.The United States is also set to offer booster vaccines to boost antibody levels following concerns over declining effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.The Oxford research also found that protection was higher among those who had already been infected with the virus.The study examined two groups of more than 300,000 people over 18, first during the period dominated by the Alpha variant, which emerged in Kent, southeast England, and secondly from May 2021 onwards, when the Delta variant has been dominant.It confirmed that vaccines are less effective against Delta, which was first seen in India.The AstraZeneca vaccine is the most widely offered in the UK, while those under 40 are offered Pfizer or Moderna due to blood clotting concerns."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-slams-wealthy-nations-rush-towards-covid-vaccine-boosters/,WHO slams wealthy nations’ rush towards Covid vaccine boosters,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization condemned Wednesday the rush by wealthy countries to provide Covid vaccine booster shots, while millions around the world have yet to receive a single dose.Speaking before US authorities announced that all vaccinated Americans would soon be eligible to receive additional doses, WHO experts insisted there was not enough scientific evidence that boosters were needed.Providing them while so many were still waiting to be immunised was immoral, they argued.“We’re planning to hand out extra life jackets to people who already have life jackets, while we’re leaving other people to drown without a single life jacket,” WHO’s emergency director Mike Ryan told reporters, speaking from the UN agency’s Geneva headquarters.“The fundamental, ethical reality is we’re handing out second life jackets while leaving millions and millions of people without anything to protect them.”Earlier this month, the WHO called for a moratorium on Covid vaccine booster shots to help ease the drastic inequity in dose distribution between rich and poor nations.That has not stopped a number of countries moving forward with plans to add a third jab, as they struggle to thwart the Delta variant. US authorities, warning that Covid-19 vaccination efficacy was decreasing over time, said Wednesday they had authorised booster shots for all Americans from September 20. They will start eight months after an individual has been fully vaccinated.While the vaccines remain “remarkably effective” in reducing the risk of severe disease, said officials, hospitalisation and death from the effects of Covid, protection could diminish in the months ahead without boosted immunisation.Washington had already authorised an extra dose for people with weakened immune systems.Israel has also begun administering third doses to Israelis aged 50 and over.But WHO experts insisted that the science was still out on boosters and stressed that ensuring that people in low-income countries where vaccination is lagging received jabs was far more important.“What is clear is that it’s critical to get first shots into arms and protect the most vulnerable before boosters are rolled out,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told Wednesday’s press conference.“The divide between the haves and have nots will only grow larger if manufacturers and leaders prioritise booster shots over supply to low- and middle-income countries,” he said.– ‘Shame on all humanity’ – Tedros voiced outrage at reports that the single-dose J&J vaccine currently being finished in South Africa was being shipped for use in Europe “where virtually all adults have been offered vaccines at this point”.“We urge J&J to urgently prioritise distribution of their vaccines to Africa before considering supplies to rich countries that already have sufficient access,” he said.“Vaccine injustice is a shame on all humanity and if we don’t tackle it together, we will prolong the acute stage of this pandemic for years when it could be over in a matter of months.”South African NGOs have denounced the shipments from South Africa as “vaccine apartheid” when less than two percent of 1.3 billion Africans have been fully vaccinated so far.“Millions of doses” produced there have been exported since March to Europe and the United States, several NGOs said in a statement Tuesday.“J&J are complicit in vaccine apartheid, diverting doses from those who really need them to the wealthiest countries on earth,” Fatima Hassan, of the South African NGO Health Justice Initiative, told AFP.“It’s colonialist extraction, plain and simple,” said Hassan.Doses are assembled and packaged in South Africa by the pharmaceutical giant Aspen in Gqeberha, formerly known as Port Elizabeth.“Global allocation of vaccines is currently not being made by public health officials but instead by a handful of company officials, who consistently prioritise Europeans and North Americans over Africans,” said Dr Matthew Kavanagh of the Health Law Institute at Georgetown University."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-authorizes-covid-vaccine-boosters-for-those-with-weakened-immune-systems/,US authorizes Covid vaccine boosters for those with weakened immune systems,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The United States on Thursday authorized an extra dose of Covid vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, as the country struggles to thwart the Delta variant.Emergency use authorization for a third injection of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was granted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulator.“The country has entered yet another wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the FDA is especially cognizant that immunocompromised people are particularly at risk for severe disease,” said acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock in a statement.The FDA said the additional dose was for solid organ transplant recipients or those with equivalent weakened immune systems.US health authorities had been debating whether a third dose may be required, following a similar move by Israel.Some United States media reports suggest that one million Americans may have had unauthorised third doses in an attempt to increase protection against Covid.“Individuals who are fully vaccinated are adequately protected and do not need an additional dose of Covid-19 vaccine at this time,” Woodcook said. Earlier this month, the United States rejected an appeal from the World Health Organization for a moratorium on booster shots to help ease the drastic inequity in dose distribution between rich and poor nations.More than 619,000 people have died in the United States from Covid-19, with case numbers increasing sharply in recent months due to the spread of the Delta variant.The country’s rapid vaccination program has slowed particularly in politically conservative regions in the South and Midwest, and among younger people, those with lower income and racial minorities.“Right now at this moment, other than the immune compromised, we’re not going to be giving boosters to people,” top US Covid advisor Anthony Fauci told NBC on Thursday.“But we will be following them very carefully, and if they do need it, we’ll be ready to give it to them… inevitably there will be a time when we will have to give boosts.”Covid-19 vaccines are free and widely available in the United States, yet only half the population is fully vaccinated.President Joe Biden announced in July that all federal employees must attest to being vaccinated or face tough restrictions such as regular testing amid a surge in hospitalizations.Propelled by the highly contagious Delta variant, coronavirus infections have soared to a daily average of more than 100,000, a level not seen since the winter surge.© Agence France-Presse"

Solidarity Plus will test 3 drugs: artesunate, a treatment for severe malaria, imatinib, a drug for certain cancers, and infliximab, a treatment for immune system disorders such as Crohn’s disease. These drugs were chosen by an independent panel of experts that evaluates all the available evidences on all potential therapeutics. The trial involves thousands of researchers at more than 600 hospitals in 52 countries,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.“Finding more effective and accessible therapeutics for Covid-19 patients remains a critical need,” he said.Artesunate is a treatment for severe malaria; imatinib a drug used for certain cancers and infliximab a treatment for immune system disorders such as Crohn’s and rheumatoid arthritis.The coordinated research across dozens of countries allows the trial to assess multiple treatments using a single protocol, thereby generating robust estimates on the effect a drug may have on mortality, including moderate effects, said the WHO.The drugs were chosen by an independent expert panel for their potential in reducing the risk of death in hospitalised Covid-19 patients.They were donated for the trial by their manufacturers and are already being shipped out to the hospitals involved.The testing of artesunate, imatinib and infliximab on Covid-19 patients is the second stage of the WHO’s Solidarity hunt for effective treatments against the killer disease.Previously, four drugs were evaluated by the Solidarity trial, involving almost 13,000 patients in 500 hospitals across 30 countries.The provisional results issued in October showed that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and interferon had little or no effect on hospitalised patients with Covid-19.The final results are due out next month.“We already have many tools to prevent, test for and treat Covid-19, including oxygen, dexamethasone and IL-6 blockers. But we need more, for patients at all ends of the clinical spectrum, from mild to severe disease,” Tedros told a news conference.The WHO Covid-19 Therapeutics Advisory Group recommended evaluating the anti-inflammatory properties of artesunate, which has been extensively used in the treatment of malaria and other parasitic diseases for more than 30 years, and is regarded as being very safe.A randomised clinical trial in the Netherlands reported that imatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, might confer clinical benefit in hospitalised Covid-19 patients.Meanwhile infliximab has shown favourable efficacy and safety in restricting broad spectrum inflammation, including in the elderly populations who are the most clinically vulnerable to Covid-19.The novel coronavirus has killed at least 4.3 million people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP, while nearly 204 million cases have been registered.Lamenting that the 200 millionth known case came just six months after the 100 millionth, Tedros said the real number of cases was “much higher”.“Whether we reach 300 million, and how fast we get there, depends on all of us,” the UN health agency chief said.“At the current trajectory, we could pass 300 million reported cases early next year. But we can change that. We’re all in this together, but the world is not acting like it.”The WHO has consistently decried the drastic imbalance between rich and poor countries in access to Covid-19 vaccines."

It is the first DNA-based vaccine to be trialled in China.China is battling its worst coronavirus outbreak in months, with officials saying many of those infected had already been vaccinated.This has added to calls for China’s two biggest vaccine producers — state-run Sinopharm and privately owned Sinovac — to provide data proving their jabs work against the Delta variant.Beijing is yet to approve any foreign vaccines for domestic use.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/factfile-the-marburg-virus-ebolas-deadly-cousin/,Factfile: The Marburg virus,1,"CONAKRY, Guinea (AFP) — , a lethal cousin to Ebola, the UN’s World Health Organization (WHO) says.Here is a factfile on the disease (source: WHO, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Marburg virus is a highly dangerous pathogen that causes haemorrhagic fever.According to past outbreaks, the average fatality rate is 50 percent, in a range of 24-88 percent.The virus is part of the so-called filovirus family to which the Ebola virus also belongs.It takes its name from the German city of Marburg, where it was first identified in 1967, in a lab where workers had been in contact with infected green monkeys that had been imported from Uganda.Two other outbreaks occurred at the same time in Frankfurt, also in Germany, and in Belgrade, then the capital of Yugoslavia, now Serbia. Seven people died. The natural “reservoir,” or host, of the Marburg virus is the African fruit bat.The cave-dwelling mammals carry the virus but do not fall sick from it, and can hand the virus to primates in close proximity, including humans — one suspected pathway is the killing or butchering of infected bats for food.Human-to-human transmission then occurs through contact with blood or other bodily fluids, or contact with surfaces such as bedding or clothing that are contaminated with these fluids. Some infections have happened accidentally in the lab, through needle wounds. The virus takes between two and 21 days to incubate, leading to abrupt symptoms of high fever, severe headaches, muscular pain, vomiting and diarrhoea — symptoms that can make Marburg difficult to diagnose initially, as they are similar to diseases such as typhoid and malaria.Haemorrhagic episodes typically follow between five and seven days later, with blood in the vomit and faeces and bleeding from the nose, gums and vagina. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days. There are no vaccines or antiviral treatments for Marburg disease. However, rehydration with oral or intravenous techniques improves survival and experimental use of monoclonal antibody drugs has been promising.This is why it is crucial to stamp out the disease from the outset, say experts.“You have to step up surveillance, identify all contact cases in order to isolate them if they start developing the disease, to prevent any transmission,” said Ousmane Faye, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. The single case that has so far been detected in Guinea occurred in a village in the district of Gueckedou, in a forested region in the south of the country close to the borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia.The patient is a man who died on August 2 after developing symptoms on July 25.Three of his relatives and a health workers have been identified as being at high risk and are under close surveillance. Around 150 others, considered contact cases, are also being monitored daily. The country has also stepped up cross-border vigilance.Previous outbreaks and sporadic cases have been recorded in South Africa, Angola, Kenya, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.The deadliest epidemic so far occurred in northern Angola in 2005, in which 329 patients out of 374 died.Guinea is one of the poorest countries in the world.It was one of three countries, along with Liberia and Sierra Leone, which was hit by the biggest-ever epidemic of Ebola, an episode that ran from 2013-16 and claimed more than 11,300 lives.A second outbreak in Guinea began in February this year, killing 12 people before being declared over on June 19."

Once caught by a human, it is spread through contact with bodily fluids of infected people, or with contaminated surfaces and materials, according to the WHO.“We applaud the alertness and the quick investigative action by Guinea’s health workers,” Moeti said.The case was detected in a village in a forested region close to the borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia.The man’s symptoms date back to July 25, the WHO said.After being initially treated at a local clinic and tested for malaria, the patient died “in the community”, the WHO said.Post-mortem samples then tested negative for Ebola, but positive for Marburg.Ten WHO experts, including epidemiologists and socio-anthropologists, are already in the field to support national health authorities.The emergency response includes risk assessment, disease surveillance, community mobilisation and screening, clinical care, infection control and logistical support, WHO said.Cross-border surveillance has also been stepped up so that possible cases can be quickly detected, it said.Three family members of the deceased and a healthcare worker have been identified as high-risk close contacts and are being monitored, while investigations are under way to identify the source of the infection and any other possible contacts, the WHO said.Previous outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in South Africa, Angola, Kenya, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.But this is the first time the virus has been detected in West Africa.The disease begins suddenly, with a high fever, severe headache and discomfort.Fatality rates have ranged from 24 percent to 88 percent in previous outbreaks, depending on the virus strain and case management, the WHO says.Although there are no approved vaccines or antiviral treatments, oral or intravenous rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival rates, it says.© Agence France-Presse"

Walensky then issued a statement warning the public about the need for extra precautions, and wearing of masks even for fully vaccinated individuals because of the highly infectious nature of the Delta variant.The results of the outbreak study in Massachusetts were clear: even fully vaccinated people can transmit the virus. This presents a big challenge to children or the immuno-compromised who are not yet vaccinated as the Delta variant can infect both young and old.“Today, some of those data were published in CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), demonstrating that Delta infection resulted in similarly high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated people,” said.“High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus,” she said in a statement.Walensky further said that “this finding is concerning and was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC’s updated mask recommendation.”“The masking recommendation was updated to ensure the vaccinated public would not unknowingly transmit virus to others, including their unvaccinated or immunocompromised loved ones,” she stressed.It was only last July 27 that the US CDC updated its guidance for fully vaccinated people, recommending that everyone wear a mask in indoor public settings in areas of substantial and high transmission, regardless of vaccination status.“This decision was made with the data and science available to CDC at the time, including a valuable public health partnership resulting in rapid receipt and review of unpublished data,” Walensky said.According to the study held last month in the outbreak of cases in Massachusetts, 74 percent of the COVID-19 cases there occurred in fully vaccinated individuals. Upon testing, the Delta variant was found in 90 percent of the specimens. As of July 27, no deaths were reported among the infected fully vaccinated individuals.“In July 2021, following multiple large public events in a Barnstable County, Massachusetts, town, 469 COVID-19 cases were identified among Massachusetts residents who had traveled to the town during July 3–17; 346 (74%) occurred in fully vaccinated persons,” the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report said.“Testing identified the Delta variant in 90% of specimens from 133 patients. Cycle threshold values were similar among specimens from patients who were fully vaccinated and those who were not.”The fully vaccinated persons who were infected with the Delta variant had been given vaccinated with Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen shots.“Among the 469 cases in Massachusetts residents, 346 (74%) occurred in persons who were fully vaccinated; of these, 301 (87%) were male, with a median age of 42 years,” the CDC report said.“Vaccine products received by persons experiencing breakthrough infections were Pfizer-BioNTech (159; 46%), Moderna (131; 38%), and Janssen (56; 16%); among fully vaccinated persons in the Massachusetts general population, 56% had received Pfizer-BioNTech, 38% had received Moderna, and 7% had received Janssen vaccine products.”“Among persons with breakthrough infection, 274 (79%) reported signs or symptoms, with the most common being cough, headache, sore throat, myalgia, and fever. Among fully vaccinated symptomatic persons, the median interval from completion of ≥14 days after the final vaccine dose to symptom onset was 86 days (range = 6–178 days). Among persons with breakthrough infection, four (1.2%) were hospitalized, and no deaths were reported,” the CDC report on the study said.“Real-time RT-PCR Ct values in specimens from 127 fully vaccinated patients (median = 22.77) were similar to those among 84 patients who were unvaccinated, not fully vaccinated, or whose vaccination status was unknown (median = 21.54).”The report also recommended additional measures including “limiting capacity at gatherings or event postponement, based on current rates of COVID-19 transmission, population vaccination coverage, and other factors.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-urges-action-to-suppress-covid-before-deadlier-variants-emerge/,WHO urges action to suppress Covid before deadlier variants emerge,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The Delta variant of Covid-19 is a warning to the world to suppress the virus quickly before it mutates again into something even worse, the WHO said Friday.The highly-transmissible variant, first detected in India, has now surfaced in 132 countries and territories, the World Health Organization said.“Delta is a warning: it’s a warning that the virus is evolving but it is also a call to action that we need to move now before more dangerous variants emerge,” the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan told a press conference.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus added: “So far, four variants of concern have emerged — and there will be more as long as the virus continues to spread.”Tedros said that on average, infections increased by 80 percent over the past four weeks in five of the six WHO regions.Though Delta has shaken many countries, Ryan said proven measures to bring transmission under control still worked — notably physical distancing, wearing masks, hand hygiene and avoiding long periods indoors in poorly ventilated, busy places.“They are stopping the Delta strain, especially when you add in vaccination,” he said.“The virus has got fitter, the virus has got faster. The game plan still works, but we need to implement and execute our game plan much more efficiently and much more effectively then we’ve ever done before.” The UN health agency has consistently called for vaccines to be distributed evenly around the world and has branded the drastic imbalance a “moral outrage”.More than four billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have now been administered globally, according to an AFP count.In countries categorised as high income by the World Bank, 98 doses per 100 people have been injected.That figure drops to 1.6 per 100 in the 29 lowest-income countries.If the four billion doses had been administered equally to people aged over 60, “we basically could have gotten two doses into everybody at highest risk of severe consequences when we got to a strain like Delta”, said Bruce Aylward, the WHO’s frontman on the Covax scheme which aims to get donor-funded jabs to poorer countries.Instead, those nations, “in the face of the Delta variant — they’re going to pay a very, very different price as a result”. The WHO wants every country to have vaccinated at least 10 percent of its population by the end of September; at least 40 percent by the end of this year, and 70 percent by the middle of 2022.“We are a long way off achieving those targets,” Tedros lamented.He said that just over half of the 194 WHO member states have fully vaccinated 10 percent of their population; less than a quarter have vaccinated 40 percent; and only three countries have vaccinated 70 percent.Meanwhile the WHO says Burundi, Eritrea and North Korea are the only remaining member states yet to start Covid-19 vaccination campaigns.The novel coronavirus has killed at least 4.2 million people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, while nearly 196.6 million cases have been registered, according to tallies from official sources compiled by AFP.Tedros said that on current rates of infection, the 200 million known infections mark will be surpassed within the next two weeks, although the true figure will be much higher.“There are no magical solutions,” said Ryan. “The only magic dust we have is vaccination. The problem is we’re not sprinkling that evenly around the world and we are working against ourselves.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/astrazeneca-searching-for-vaccines-for-virus-hit-southeast-asia/,AstraZeneca searching for vaccines for virus-hit Southeast Asia,1,"BANGKOK, Thailand (AFP) — Drugmaker AstraZeneca said Saturday it was scouring its supply chain to find more doses of its Covid-19 vaccine for Southeast Asia, which is facing its most serious outbreak yet of the virus.The statement from the Anglo-Swedish company — which produces its vaccine in Thailand for use domestically and in neighbouring countries — comes in the wake of a supply shortage which has sparked heavy criticism of Thai Premier Prayut Chan-O-Cha’s administration.Under the terms of AstraZeneca’s agreement with Thai authorities, 180 million doses are due for production, one-third destined for the Thai market and the rest to be exported.By the end of July AstraZeneca will have delivered 11.3 million doses for Thailand, according to James Teague, AstraZeneca’s representative in the country.Exports have still not begun, even as the region faces a particularly virulent wave of Covid-19.“We are delivering in the fastest possible timeframe, however, given the gravity of the Delta variant, we are leaving no stone unturned to accelerate supply further still,” Teague said in an “open letter to the people of Thailand”.“We are also scouring the 20+ supply chains in our worldwide manufacturing network to find additional vaccines for Southeast Asia, including Thailand.”But “a global supply crunch” for Covid-19 vaccines and a shortage of the materials required to make them made it difficult to provide a specific timeframe, he added.The AstraZeneca contract was awarded last year to Siam Bioscience, a firm owned by King Maha Vajiralongkorn that has no track record of producing vaccines.It set out to produce vaccines for nine countries including Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, as well as Thailand.Siam Bioscience has not commented on reports of insufficient production or late delivery.But Thailand has been forced to change its vaccine strategy by importing millions of doses of Chinese vaccines.Anger is mounting, with just five percent of Thailand’s 70 million residents fully vaccinated.Most Thais avoid talking about it openly because of harsh lese majeste laws that make it illegal to criticise the monarch. Those that do face between three and 15 years in prison.Former opposition leader and billionaire Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit has already been accused under the law after he said the vaccination policy was too dependent on Siam Bioscience.Thailand is among a host of Southeast Asian countries that kept infection numbers low during 2020 but now face record numbers of cases amid slow vaccination campaigns."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/philippines-approves-gmo-golden-rice-for-commercial-production/,Philippines approves GMO ‘golden rice’ for commercial production,1,"MANILA, Philippines (AFP) — The Philippines became the world’s first country Friday to approve the commercial production of genetically modified “golden rice” that experts hope will combat childhood blindness and save lives in the developing world.A biosafety permit issued by government regulators paves the way for the rice — enriched with the vitamin A-precursor beta-carotene to make it more nutritional — to be grown by farmers across the country, its developers said.“It’s a really significant step for our project because it means that we are past this regulatory phase and golden rice will be declared as safe as ordinary rice,” Russell Reinke of the Philippine-based International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) told AFP ahead of the announcement.The next step was to “take our few kilos of seed and multiply it… so it can be made more widely available”, he said.IRRI has spent two decades working with the Department of Agriculture-Philippine Rice Research Institute to develop golden rice — named for its bright yellow hue.It is the first genetically modified rice approved for commercial propagation in South and Southeast Asia, officials said Friday.Golden rice has faced strong resistance from environmental groups opposed to genetically altered food plants. At least one test field in the Philippines was attacked by activists.Despite passing the final regulatory hurdle, the rice is still a way off appearing in food bowls.“Limited quantities” of seed could start to be distributed to Filipino farmers in selected provinces next year, Reinke said.Ordinary rice, a staple for hundreds of millions of people particularly in Asia, produces beta-carotene in the plant, but it is not found in the grain.“The only change that we’ve made is to produce beta-carotene in the grain,” Reinke said.“The farmers will be able to grow them in exactly the same way as ordinary varieties… it doesn’t need additional fertiliser or changes in management and it carries with it the benefit of improved nutrition.”Vitamin A is essential for normal growth and development, the proper functioning of the immune system, and vision.World Health Organization data show vitamin A deficiency causes up to 500,000 cases of childhood blindness every year, with half of those dying within 12 months of losing their sight.Nearly 17 percent of children under the age of five in the Philippines are deficient in vitamin A, according to IRRI.“We’ve always said we will provide 30-50 percent of that estimated average requirement (of vitamin A), and when you add that to what is existing in the diet you push up a whole cohort of the population from insufficiency to sufficiency,” Reinke said.Golden rice was analysed by food safety regulators in Australia, the United States and Canada and was given the thumbs up, he said, but it has not been approved in these countries for commercial production.It is also being reviewed by regulators in Bangladesh."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-warns-of-long-term-covid-impact-on-mental-health/,WHO warns of ‘long term’ Covid impact on mental health,1,"ATHENS, Greece (AFP) — The mental health impact of the pandemic will be “long-term and far-reaching”, the World Health Organization said Thursday, as experts and leaders called for action on Covid-linked anxiety and stress. “Everyone is affected in one way or another,” the WHO said in a statement at the start of a two-day meeting in Athens with health ministers from dozens of countries. It said “anxieties around virus transmission, the psychological impact of lockdowns and self-isolation” had contributed to a mental health crisis, along with stresses linked to unemployment, financial worries and social alienation. “The mental health impacts of the pandemic will be long term and far-reaching,” the statement added.The WHO’s regional director for Europe Hans Kluge said mental health should be considered a “fundamental human right”, stressing how the virus had torn lives apart. “The pandemic has shaken the world,” he told the conference. “More than four million lives lost globally, livelihoods ruined, families and communities forced apart, businesses bankrupted, and people deprived of opportunities.”The WHO called for the strengthening of mental health services in general and the improvement of access to care via technology. It also urged better psychological support services in schools, universities, workplaces and for people on the front line of the fight against Covid-19.The ministers heard from a 38-year-old Greek woman called Katerina who told them how she had been receiving treatment for a psychiatric disorder since 2002 and had been coping well until the pandemic hit.She was no longer able to attend in-person support groups and could not see her father, forcing her to boost her treatment. “The pressure of social isolation led to increased anxiety,” she said."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-warns-of-dangerous-variants-as-covid-cases-rise-globally/,WHO warns of ‘dangerous’ variants as Covid cases rise globally,1,"The World Health Organization (WHO) warned Thursday that “more dangerous” variants of Covid-19 could tear across the world as global infections soared to half a million daily, largely driven by the virulent Delta strain.An AFP tally of official sources found that after an initial dip, cases have been rising again worldwide since the end of June, topping 540,000 on Tuesday and again on Wednesday.“The pandemic is nowhere near finished,” the WHO’s emergency committee said in a statement.It highlighted “the strong likelihood for the emergence and global spread of new and possibly more dangerous variants of concern that may be even more challenging to control”.The virus has reappeared in places long believed to have dodged the worst of the pandemic, with Australia — lauded for its successful “Covid zero” strategy — facing a resurgence that has grown to almost 1,000 cases nationwide in a month.About 12 million Australians went under stay-at-home orders in the country’s second biggest city Melbourne, joining residents in Sydney.State premier Dan Andrews said he took the decision to return the city — and surrounding Victoria — to its fifth lockdown “with a heavy heart”.“Nothing about this virus is fair,” he said. The coronavirus continues to wreak havoc from Asia to Africa, killing more than four million people since it first emerged in China in December 2019.In Tokyo — now just over a week away from the opening ceremony of the virus-postponed Olympics — local authorities recorded 1,308 new cases, the highest number since January.Organisers confirmed that an athlete in Japan and five Olympic workers, mostly contractors, had tested positive for Covid-19.This came after eight staff at a hotel hosting Brazil’s Olympic judo team tested positive, and a staff member from Russia’s rugby sevens team was hospitalised after a positive test.Covid-19 is posing a unique challenge for organisers of sports events.Three members of the McLaren Formula One team tested positive, including chief executive officer Zak Brown, the British outfit announced Thursday, ahead of the British GP in Silverstone.And India wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant tested positive as the squad prepared for a Test series in England. Countries where healthcare infrastructure — and vaccine rollout capabilities — remain limited are under particular pressure, with Rwanda set to put the capital Kigali and eight other districts under lockdown from Saturday.The East African nation had previously avoided the worst of the pandemic by enforcing some of the strictest containment measures on the continent.But hospitals have been overwhelmed in recent weeks, with a critical shortage of beds and medicines.Overall, coronavirus-linked deaths in Africa surged by 43 percent in the space of week, driven by a lack of intensive-care beds and oxygen, the WHO said Thursday. In Asia, Indonesia Thursday posted a record 56,757 daily infections as the world’s fourth-most populous nation overtook India as the region’s Covid-19 epicentre.The China-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank said it was loaning the Southeast Asian nation $500 million to boost its response.Vaccine doses are flowing into the hard-hit country by the millions, including from Japan and the United States, while Jakarta on Thursday approved the Pfizer/BioNTech jab for emergency use.Also facing chronic shortages of medical supplies is Myanmar, where residents across the coup-hit country’s biggest city of Yangon defied a military curfew in a desperate search for oxygen to keep their loved ones with Covid breathing.Residents told AFP they had slipped out in the dead of night to secure spots in lines to refill oxygen cylinders — dismissing claims from the country’s military rulers that there is more than enough to go around.As the virus shows no sign of easing, the WHO is working towards the second phase of an investigation into where Covid-19 originated, and urged China on Thursday to better cooperate.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus demanded more access to raw data after a report compiled by a team of independent experts in Wuhan earlier this year was widely criticised for lack of transparency and access."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/biontech-produces-10-times-more-antibodies-than-chinas-sinovac-hk-study/,BioNTech produces 10 times more antibodies than China’s Sinovac: HK study,1,"HONG KONG, China (AFP) — People who received BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine had ten times the amount of antibodies than those given China’s Sinovac, a Hong Kong study has shown, adding to growing data on different jabs’ effectiveness.The University of Hong Kong (HKU) research, based on a study of 1,442 healthcare workers, was published in Lancet Microbe on Thursday.Researchers said antibodies are not the only measure of a vaccine’s success at fighting a particular disease.But they warned that “the difference in concentrations of neutralising antibodies identified in our study could translate into substantial differences in vaccine effectiveness”.Those who received Sinovac had “similar or lower” levels of antibodies to those seen in patients who caught and successfully fought off the disease.The study adds to the growing body of evidence that vaccines using pioneering mRNA technology — such as BioNTech and Moderna — offer better protection against the coronavirus and its variants that those developed by more traditional methods such as using inactivated virus parts.Traditional vaccines are cheaper to produce and less complicated to transport and store, making them a vital tool for fighting the pandemic in less wealthy countries. Epidemiologist Ben Cowling, one of the report’s authors, said people should still get vaccinated with Sinovac if there was no other option because some protection was always better than none.“Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” he told AFP.“It is clearly better to go and get vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine than to wait and not get vaccinated,” he added.“Many, many lives have been saved by the inactivated vaccine.”The researchers said their data suggested “alternative strategies” such as earlier booster shots might be needed to increase protection for those who have received Sinovac.Cowling said when to give booster shots would be the next phase of their ongoing studies.“The priority would be boosters for people who received Sinovac while boosters for people who initially received BioNTech might not be so urgent,” he said. Hong Kong has been a world leader in studying coronaviruses ever since a SARS outbreak which began in southern China swept through the city in 2003.The city currently offers both German-made BioNTech shots and Sinovac.Despite ample supplies, take-up has been slow, with only 28 percent of the city’s 7.5 million residents fully vaccinated with two shots.So far some 2.6 million BioNTech doses have been administered compared to 1.8 million Sinovac shots.The rollout has been caught up in Hong Kong’s febrile politics, as China cracks down on dissent in the city in response to huge and often violent democracy protests two years ago.At the start of the vaccination campaign Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing leaders very visibly and near unanimously opted for Sinovac.One doctor’s clinic that recommended BioNTech over Sinovac was kicked out of the city’s vaccination programme.Many of the city’s leading epidemiologists have gone with BioNTech, and said publicly that it is their preferred shot."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/90-year-old-infected-with-two-virus-variants-at-once/,90-year-old infected with ‘two virus variants at once’,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — A 90-year-old woman who died after falling ill with Covid-19 was infected with both the Alpha and Beta variants of the coronavirus at the same time, researchers in Belgium said Sunday, adding that the rare phenomenon may be underestimated.The unvaccinated woman, who lived alone and received at-home nursing care, was admitted to the OLV Hospital in the Belgian city of Aalst after a spate of falls in March and tested positive for Covid-19 the same day.While her oxygen levels were initially good, her condition deteriorated rapidly and she died five days later.When medical staff tested for the presence of any variants of concern they found that she was carrying both the Alpha strain, which originated in Britain, and the Beta variant first detected in South Africa.“Both these variants were circulating in Belgium at the time, so it is likely that the lady was co-infected with different viruses from two different people,” said molecular biologist Anne Vankeerberghen from the OLV Hospital who led the research.“Unfortunately, we don’t know how she became infected.”Vankeerberghen said it was difficult to say whether the co-infection played a role in the fast deterioration of the patient.The research, which has not yet been submitted to a medical journal for publication, is being presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases.While Vankeerberghen said in a press release that there had been “no other published cases” of similar co-infections, she added that the “phenomenon is probably underestimated”.This is because of limited testing for variants of concern, she said, calling for an increase in the use of fast PCR testing to detect known variant mutations.In January, scientists in Brazil reported that two people had been simultaneously infected with two different strains of the coronavirus, but the study has yet to be published in a scientific journal.In comments reacting to the research, Lawrence Young, a virologist and Professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick, said it was not a surprise to find an individual infected with more than one strain.“This study does highlight the need for more studies to determine whether infection with multiple variants of concern affects the clinical course of Covid-19 and whether this in any way compromises the efficacy of vaccination,” he added.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/sinovacs-coronavac-jab-less-effective-against-gamma-variant-study/,Sinovac’s CoronaVac jab less effective against Gamma variant: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — The Chinese CoronaVac jab, a key tool in Brazil’s fight against Covid-19, is less effective against the Gamma variant first detected in the virus-ravaged South American country, a study said Friday.Researchers found that antibodies generated by the vaccine work less well against the variant than a previous coronavirus strain, while Gamma may also be able to reinfect people who had previously had the virus.Gamma’s capacity to evade these immune system responses even in immunised people suggest “the virus can potentially circulate in vaccinated individuals — even in areas with high vaccination rates,” the study authors said in a press release.In the small study, researchers at the University of Campinas in Brazil exposed both Gamma and a previous strain of the virus to antibodies in blood plasma from 53 vaccinated people and 21 people who had been previously infected with the virus.In the vaccinated group, 18 people had received just one dose of CoronaVac — one of the main vaccines in Brazil’s coronavirus response — while 20 had recently received a second jab and a further 15 had been vaccinated as part of the Sinovac clinical trial in August 2020.They found that Gamma was able to escape the antibodies of almost all the participants who had received only one dose, as well as those vaccinated in 2020.The antibodies from those more recently vaccinated were effective, but less so than against the previous virus strain.The study, published in The Lancet Microbe, also found that antibodies produced by previous infections had to be nine times higher to prevent infection by Gamma than to prevent illness from the previous strain.The authors said those results mean people who have already survived a case of Covid-19 could be reinfected.But they said since clinical trials suggest the vaccine is effective in preventing severe illness and death, it could be that the immune response is more complex. CoronaVac was approved by the World Health Organization for emergency use in June.At the time the WHO said it had a 51 percent efficacy against symptomatic disease and 100 percent against hospitalisation.But results from CoronaVac phase 3 trials in Turkey — that did not take variants into account — published Friday in the Lancet found two doses of the vaccine had an efficacy of 83.5 percent in protecting against symptomatic infections.It also found the vaccine was 100 percent effective against hospitalisation.The study involved 6,559 participants who received the vaccine and 3,470 who were given a placebo.All were adults aged between 18 and 59 and were given doses 14 days apart.The authors said the limitations of the trial include that the participants were under 60 and low risk, calling for further research to test efficacy among older adults and under 18s, as well as against new variants.“The world needs every possible dose of any safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2,” they said.Both papers are to be presented at this year’s European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases."

The companies anticipate the clinical studies will begin in August, subject to regulatory approvals.The companies added that, based on drop-offs in efficacy seen in Israel after six months, they believe that a third dose may be needed within six to 12 months after full vaccination“While protection against severe disease remained high across the full 6 months, a decline in efficacy against symptomatic disease over time and the continued emergence of variants are expected,” the statement said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-urges-extreme-caution-in-lifting-covid-restrictions/,WHO urges ‘extreme caution’ in lifting Covid restrictions,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization on Wednesday urged “extreme caution” for countries considering lifting Covid-19 restrictions, warning that high vaccination rates would not stop transmission of the virus increasing.The UN health agency urged governments not to squander hard-won gains and return to scenes of overwhelmed hospitals and exhausted health workers.Asked about England’s plans to ditch most of its coronavirus restrictions from July 19, WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said: “I would urge extreme caution in the complete lifting of public health and social measures at this time, because there are consequences for that.”WHO figures show that globally, after a decline in newly reported cases for seven consecutive weeks, there was a slight increase in new cases in the past two weeks.Cases jumped 30 percent in the WHO’s European region over the past week.European countries have administered 70 vaccine doses per 100 inhabitants, according to AFP figures.“Making assumptions that transmission will not increase because we’re opening up, because of vaccine, is a false assumption,” said Ryan.“Transmission will increase when you open up, because we don’t have vaccines in everybody… and we’re still not sure to what extent vaccination protects against the ability to be infected or have onward transmission.“With increased transmission in the community, we then put our most vulnerable at risk again.”British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday revealed plans to lift most of England’s legal coronavirus restrictions, including face masks and social distancing, urging personal responsibility rather than government edict.Ryan stressed he did not want to comment on specific countries, but said: “The idea that everyone is protected… and everything goes back to normal, I think right now is a very dangerous assumption anywhere in the world.”And that included Europe, where “we’ve seen wave after wave of cases,” he said.“We would ask governments to be really careful at this moment not to lose the gains we’ve made. To open up very carefully.“I would hope that in the European environment we won’t see a return to the overwhelmed hospitals and the exhausted health workers. But that’s not a given.”Ryan said countries lifting restrictions needed to follow the data and give themselves the option of rowing back if it resulted in negative consequences.Opening up with low vaccine coverage and variants circulating “is a real toxic mixture for your hospitals filling up again, and this is something that must absolutely be avoided”, he added.Ryan flatly rejected the notion that it would be better to lift restrictions and risk triggering a fresh wave of infections in the summer than doing so in the winter months.“The logic of more people being infected is better, is, I think, logic that has proven its moral emptiness and its epidemiologic stupidity,” he said."

It has been detected in 29 countries, eight in Latin America. Recently it has also been discovered in the UK, US, Germany, Australia and in other countries in Europe as well.The World Health Organization (WHO) classified Lambda as a “variant of interest” and not yet a variant of concern.On June 23, the UK’s Public Health England (PHE) classified Lambda as a “variant under investigation” due to “international expansion and several notable mutations including L452Q and F490S.”It has identified six cases of the Lambda variant across the UK as of June 25.“There is currently no evidence that this variant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines currently deployed any less effective. PHE is carrying out laboratory testing to better understand the impact of mutations on the behaviour of the virus,” PHE said in a statement.WHO virologist Jairo Mendez-Rico told DW News earlier that they are still closely studying this Lambda variant and so far they “have seen no indication” that it is more aggressive.“It is possible that it may exhibit higher infection rates, but we don’t yet have enough reliable data to compare it to gamma or delta,” he said.“So far we have seen no indication that the Lambda variant is more aggressive,” the WHO virologist Jairo Mendez-Rico said. “It is possible that it may exhibit higher infection rates, but we don’t yet have enough reliable data to compare it to gamma or delta.”Chilean researchers, however, who studied the Lambda variant noted “the presence of critical mutations in the spike protein.”Concerned about the “impact of such mutations in infectivity and immune escape from neutralizing antibodies,” Chilean scientists and researchers Mónica L. Acevedo, Luis Alonso-Palomares, Andrés Bustamante, Aldo Gaggero, Fabio Paredes, Claudia P. Cortés, Fernando Valiente-Echeverría, and Ricardo Soto-Rifo conducted their study on Santiago City health workers. The results of their study which had not yet been peer reviewed was published on The health workers who were the subject of their study received two doses of CoronaVac vaccine of Sinovac.“We observed an increased infectivity mediated by the Lambda spike protein that was even higher than that of the D614G (lineage B) or the Alpha and Gamma variants. Compared to the Wild type (lineage A), neutralization was decreased by 3.05-fold for the Lambda variant while it was 2.33-fold for the Gamma variant and 2.03-fold for the Alpha variant,” the researchers explained in their study results.“Our results indicate that mutations present in the spike protein of the Lambda variant of interest confer increased infectivity and immune escape from neutralizing antibodies elicited by CoronaVac,” they said in the published preprint of their research.They noted the importance of continuing genomic surveillance of COVID-19 cases even in countries with massive vaccination campaigns. This is to further determine the impact of the mutations in escaping immunity.“These data reinforce the idea that massive vaccination campaigns in countries with high SARS-CoV-2 circulation must be accompanied by strict genomic surveillance allowing the identification of new isolates carrying spike mutations and immunology studies aimed to determine the impact of these mutations in immune escape and vaccines breakthrough,” they said.In Chile, there is an “intentive vaccination campaign which mostly relies in the inactivated virus vaccine from Sinovac Biotech and to a lesser extent in the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech and the non-replicative viral vector vaccines from Oxford/AstraZeneca and Cansino Biologicals.”Still, the scientists noted that the last surge reported there “has been dominated by the SARS-CoV-2 variants Gamma and Lambda, the former classified as a variant of concern several months ago and the latter being recently recognized as a variant of interest by the WHO.”According to another research pre-print published in medRxiv, the Lambda variant “now accounts for 97% of Peruvian public genomes in April 2021.”“It is expanding in Chile and Argentina, and there is evidence of onward transmission in Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, the USA, Germany, and Israel,” said a study entitled “The Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Variant Lambda (C.37) in South America” posted by .The new variant has emerged even in countries with high vaccination rates.The results of the research published in the medRxiv preprint has not yet been peer-reviewed. The researchers who conducted this study were Pedro E. Romero, Alejandra Dávila-Barclay, Guillermo Salvatierra, Luis González, Diego Cuicapuz, Luis Solis, Pool Marcos-Carbajal, Janet Huancachoque, Lenin Maturrano, and Pablo Tsukayama."

A report by the European Union’s disease control agency ECDC estimated the more contagious strain could account for 90 percent of new cases in the EU by the end of August."

That means protecting their lives and livelihoods, including their ability to travel and conduct trade,” WHO said in its Joint COVAX Statement on the Equal Recognition of Vaccines issued on July 1.“As travel and other possibilities begin to open up in some parts of the world, COVAX urges all regional, national and local government authorities to recognise as fully vaccinated all people who have received COVID-19 vaccines that have been deemed safe and effective by the World Health Organization and/or the 11 Stringent Regulatory Authorities (SRAs) approved for COVID-19 vaccines, when making decisions on who is able to travel or attend events,” WHO said in a statement.The organization also lamented measures in some countries that will choose only certain types of vaccines from the WHO’s EUL over other approved vaccines, saying this would further widen the global vaccine divide.”“Any measure that only allows people protected by a subset of WHO-approved vaccines to benefit from the re-opening of travel into and with that region would effectively create a two-tier system, further widening the global vaccine divide and exacerbating the inequities we have already seen in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines,” WHO said.“It would negatively impact the growth of economies that are already suffering the most.”WHO also hinted that measures or policies where Western-made vaccines are preferred over other COVID jabs undermine confidence in the vaccines which had passed WHO’s expert scrutiny.“Such moves are already undermining confidence in life-saving vaccines that have already been shown to be safe and effective, affecting uptake of vaccines and potentially putting billions of people at risk. At a time when the world is trying to resume trade, commerce and travel, this is counter-effective, both in spirit and outcome,” it said.“COVAX commends countries that have already shown commitment to equity as well as safety by accepting travelers protected by all vaccines validated by WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) and/or the 11 Stringent Regulatory Authorities (SRAs) approved for COVID-19 vaccines. We call on other nations and regions to do the same,” it added."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/frances-sanofi-to-invest-2-billion-euros-in-mrna-vaccines/,France’s Sanofi to invest 2 billion euros in mRNA vaccines,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi said Tuesday that it would invest 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in the mRNA vaccine technology behind the pioneering Covid-19 jabs developed by rivals BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna.Sanofi, which was left trailing in the race to break out a Covid vaccine in 2020, said it would invest 400 million euros a year between now and 2025 to develop at least six vaccine candidates using messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA).It said it would set up an mRNA “centre of excellence” employing 400 people at its laboratories in the US city of Cambridge and Marcy-L’Etoile near the French city of Lyon.“This massive new investment clearly puts us in the race to develop next-generation vaccines where mRNA technologies can have greatest impact,” Thomas Triomphe, global head of Sanofi Pasteur, said in a statement.“While mRNA won’t be the solution for every infectious disease, its translation into routine prevention could have immense impact for many unmet public health needs,” he added.For Covid-19, mRNA works by providing human cells with the genetic instructions to make a surface protein of the coronavirus, which trains the immune system to recognise the real virus.Making a traditional vaccine is a longer process that normally involves developing a weakened form of a pathogen.Sanofi, which initially went the traditional route, is still racing to make up ground in the colossal market for Covid jabs.Jean-Francois Toussaint, head of R&D at Sanofi Pasteur, said that while mRNA had “demonstrated potential to deliver new vaccines faster than ever before” the technology still needed improvements to be used “in routine vaccination against a broader set of infectious diseases and across all ages.”The company and its British partner GSK started the final tests of their belated Covid jab in May, with the aim of launching it by the end of 2021, a year after Pfizer’s and Moderna’s jabs received regulatory approvalThe Sanofi-GSK vaccine combines an antigen, which stimulates the production of germ-killing antibodies, with adjuvant technology, a substance that bolsters the immune response triggered by a vaccine.Sanofi is however also developing an mRNA shot with US firm Translate Bio and recently began human trials of an anti-flu jab using the same platform."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/delta-variant-mutation-delta-plus-variant-declared-as-new-variant-of-concern-in-india/,Delta variant mutation – “Delta Plus” variant declared as new variant of concern in India,1,"(Eagle News) – A new variant of concern was declared in India, known as the “Delta Plus” variant.This new variant of concern is a mutation of the earlier Delta variant which caused the surge in cases in India early this year.India’s Ministry of Health declared that the Delta Plus variant, or AY.1, was observed in three states – Maharashtra, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh. It said 40 cases had been identified so far.“As of now among the samples sequenced (45000+) in India, Delta plus variant — AY.1 –has been observed sporadically in Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh, with around 40 cases identified so far and no significant increase in prevalence,” the Union Ministry of Health statement said.The health ministry further identified the following characteristics of the new variant of concern: • Increased transmissibility • Stronger binding to receptors of lung cells • Potential reduction in monoclonal antibody responseIt is however not yet known is this is deadlier than the Delta variant — B.1.617.2 – which caused the deadly surge in India in late March to April.According to India’s health ministry, the Delta variant as well as all Delta sub-lineages including Delta Plus are classified as variants of concern or VOC.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the new Delta Plus variant has already been observed in 10 countries: India, US, UK, Portugal, Switzerland, Japan, Poland, Nepal, China and Russia.Meanwhile, the highly contagious Delta strain, which was also first detected in India, has already been found in 92 countries, according to Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization’s technical lead for COVID-19."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-patients-with-liver-disease-history-of-alcohol-abuse-80-more-likely-to-die-from-virus-study/,COVID patients with liver disease,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — A survey of people hospitalised for Covid-19 found those with chronic liver disease and a history of alcohol abuse were 80 percent more likely to die from the virus and less likely to receive life-saving intubation.In research to be presented this week at the International Liver Congress, researchers based in France analysed the national database of 259,000 Covid patients admitted to hospitals in 2020.Some 16,300 of those had been previously diagnosed with chronic liver disease.The average rate of death among all patients hospitalised with the virus was 15 percent. Among those with chronic liver disease, however, the rate jumped to nearly a quarter.But while previous studies had looked at liver failure as a factor in the severity of Covid, this study found that mortality could be linked to which patients were placed on ventilation.According to the study, patients who suffered alcoholism, advanced cirrhosis or liver cancer and showed higher Covid-19 morbidity and were less likely to have been intubated.Patients with milder liver problems — from chronic liver disease unrelated to alcohol abuse, organ transplants and viral hepatitis for example — were not at heightened risk for Covid-19 mortality but received ventilation at a greater rate.“Our results suggest that a limitation of the therapeutic effort may have contributed to the excess mortality of patients with a liver-related complication and of patients with alcohol use disorders,” the study said.Thomas Berg, incoming president of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), told AFP the findings reflected a trend in care for liver patients that pre-dates the pandemic.“There is already some public data showing that having a liver-related complication and an alcohol-abuse disorder reduces the likelihood of being mechanically ventilated by 20-25 percent,” he said. A 2013 US survey of 300 people with mild and advanced liver diseases found the majority of respondents perceived a stigma against their diagnosis.“Most patients are willing to talk about if they have a cardiac disease or cancer,” Berg said, “but when it comes to liver disease there is always the perception it is self-inflicted, related to drugs or alcohol.”The national survey is the largest that has looked at the question of how likely chronic liver disease patients are to survive a coronavirus infection.France’s universal access to hospital care means a wide range of Covid patients were represented, and analysts could look back at 10 years of records from the national discharge database to determine comorbidities.“It’s an important study because the data is coming from a natural registry and the data is quite robust,” said Berg.Other studies to be presented at the conference look at how the pandemic has affected alcohol use in general.Last month figures from Britain’s Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed there had been 7,423 deaths directly caused by misuse of alcohol in 2020 — a 20 percent rise from 2019 and a 20-year high."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-19-how-vaccines-work-against-the-delta-variant/,history of alcohol abuse 80% more likely to die from virus: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) – The Delta variant of the coronavirus, first identified in India, is a cause for global concern with studies showing it is more contagious and resistant to vaccines than other forms of Covid.But there is also evidence vaccines retain important effectiveness against Delta after two doses.Here is what we know about how variants respond to jabs.Several lab tests show that the Delta variant seems to have stronger resistance to vaccines than other variants do.A British study published in the Lancet medical journal in early June looked at levels of neutralising antibodies produced in vaccinated people exposed to the Delta, Alpha (first identified in Britain) and Beta (first identified in South Africa) variants.It found that antibody levels in people with two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot were six times lower in the presence of the Delta variant than in the presence of the original Covid-19 strain on which the vaccine was based.The Alpha and Beta variants also provoked lower responses, with 2.6 times fewer antibodies for Alpha and 4.9 times fewer for Beta.A French study from the Pasteur Institute concluded that neutralising antibodies produced by vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech jab are three to six times less effective against the Delta variant than against the Alpha variant.Although they represent an essential marker, the levels of antibodies measured in a lab are not enough to determine the efficacy of a vaccine.In particular they do not take into account a second immune response in the form of killer T cells — which attack already-infected cells and not the virus itself.As a result, real-world observations are crucial to measuring vaccine effectiveness — and the first results are reassuring.According to data published on Monday by Public Health England, vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca is as effective at preventing hospitalisation in the case of the Delta variant as it is in the case of the Alpha variant.Two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab prevent 96 percent of hospitalisations due to the Delta variant, while AstraZeneca prevents 92 percent, according to a study involving 14,000 people.Previous data released by British health authorities at the end of May come to similar conclusions for less serious forms of the illness.The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is 88 percent effective against symptomatic Covid caused by the Delta variant two weeks after the second dose, while the jab is 93 percent effective for cases caused by the Alpha variant.AstraZeneca shows efficacy of 60 percent against cases caused by the Delta variant and 66 percent in the case of Alpha.Scottish authorities published similar data on Monday in the Lancet.The team behind the Sputnik V jab meanwhile tweeted on Tuesday that theirs was “more efficient against the Delta variant… than any other vaccine that published results on this strain so far”.They did not publish results but said the study by the Gamaleya Center, a Russian research institute, had been submitted for publication in an international peer-reviewed journal.Among authorised vaccines only one — developed by Janssen — is given in one dose instead of two, and not enough data exists to determine its effectiveness against the Delta variant.For the others, lab and real-world tests both conclude that one dose of any vaccine only gives limited protection against the Delta variant.“After a single dose of Pfizer-BioNTech, 79% of people had a quantifiable neutralising antibody response against the original strain, but this fell to… 32% for B.1.617.2 (Delta),” says the lab study from June.The Pasteur Institute found that a single dose of AstraZeneca would have “little to no efficacy” against the Delta variant.Data from the British government confirms the tendency in real-world scenarios: both vaccines were 33 percent effective against symptomatic cases caused by Delta 3 weeks after the first dose compared to around 50 percent effectiveness against the Alpha variant.In the UK — where the Delta variant is now responsible for 96 percent of new cases — these findings pushed the government on Monday to reduce the waiting period between doses from 12 weeks to eight for people over 40.In France the wait has been reduced to three weeks from five for a second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.The Pfizer/BioNTech jab does however offer very high (94 percent) protection against hospitalisation due to the Delta variant after one dose.Scientists agree that the best defence against the Delta variant is to get a full two-dose vaccination against coronavirus.Top French scientist Jean-François Delfraissy says creating a “block of vaccinated people” will help keep the Delta variant from spreading throughout the population.A US study from June 10 points to the importance of vaccination to keeping the list of variants from growing.“Increasing the proportion of the population immunised with current safe and effective authorised vaccines remains a key strategy to minimise the emergence of new variants and end the COVID-19 pandemic”, it says.Antoine Flahault, who heads up the University of Geneva’s Institute of Global Health, insists it is still crucial to observe social distancing, share infection information, and observe restrictions when necessary to “keep virus circulation low”.The more the virus circulates, he says, the more opportunity it has to mutate and generate new variations.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-19-vaccine-more-than-90-percent-effective-novavax/,Covid-19: How vaccines work against the Delta variant,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Novavax’s Covid-19 jab is more than 90 percent effective, including against coronavirus variants, the vaccine maker said Monday after a large-scale US study.The jab “demonstrated 100% protection against moderate and severe disease, 90.4% efficacy overall,” the company said in a statement, adding “the study enrolled 29,960 participants across 119 sites in the U.S. and Mexico to evaluate efficacy, safety and immunogenicity.”The Maryland-headquartered company said it intended to apply for regulatory approval by the third quarter of 2021.After that, it said, it would be on course to make 100 million doses per month by the end of the third quarter and 150 million doses per month by the end of the year.“Today, Novavax is one step closer to addressing the critical and persistent global public health need for additional COVID-19 vaccines,” said Stanley C. Erck, Novavax’s president and chief executive.“Novavax continues to work with a sense of urgency to complete our regulatory submissions and deliver this vaccine, built on a well understood and proven platform, to a world that is still in great need of vaccines.”While some rich countries have made progress on vaccinating their populations, there remain concerns that many poorer countries are being left out of the global inoculation drive.Vaccination rates in the world’s poorest nations are far behind the Group of Seven industrialized powers and other wealthy states — in terms of doses administered so far, the imbalance between the G7 and the planet’s low-income countries, as defined by the World Bank, is 73 to one.Unlike some rival jabs, Novavax’s vaccine — formally known as NVX-CoV2373 — does not have to be stored at ultra-low temperatures.The company said it was “stored and stable at 2°- 8°C, allowing the use of existing vaccine supply chain channels for its distribution.”In theory at least, this means the shots should be more easily transported and administered in countries with less well developed health infrastructures.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/moderna-seeks-us-authorization-for-covid-vaccine-in-teens/,Covid-19 vaccine more than 90 percent effective: Novavax,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — American biotech company Moderna said Thursday it was asking the US Foods and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine to be given to adolescents.The move was widely expected after the company announced in May-early results from a trial of 3,700 12-to-17-year-olds that found the two-dose regimen was safe and highly effective.On Monday, Moderna made similar requests to the European and Canadian regulators.“We are encouraged that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection in adolescents,” said the company’s CEO Stephane Bancel.Vaccine efficacy was shown to be 100 percent after two doses when using the same definition of symptomatic disease that was applied to the adult trial.It fell to 93 percent after one dose when using a more stringent definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that requires just one symptom in addition to a positive test.No significant safety concerns were noted. The most common side effects outside the injection site after the second dose were headache, fatigue, body aches and chills.The FDA authorized the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for children aged 12 to 15 years old in May.Although adolescents are much less susceptible to severe Covid than adults, experts believe they are important to reach in order to help achieve population immunity against the disease.The Moderna Covid-19 vaccine was developed in collaboration with the US National Institutes of Health using messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology.It uses genetic material to deliver instructions to human cells to create the spike protein of the coronavirus, thereby training an immune response without exposing the host to a real infection.The US has reached almost 52 percent of its population of 332 million with at least one dose, but its vaccination campaign is slowing in the face of hesitancy.President Joe Biden has set a target of having 70 percent of adults vaccinated with at least one dose by July 4. The current figure is just under 64 percent, and the goal might be missed.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/coronavac-reduces-mortality-by-97-percent-uruguay-study/,Moderna seeks US authorization for Covid vaccine in teens,1,"MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AFP) — The CoronaVac vaccine reduces coronavirus mortality by 97 percent, according to early results of the immunization campaign in Uruguay, which relies heavily on the Chinese jab.In people who had received two doses, it reduced infection with the coronavirus by 57 percent and intensive care admissions by 95 percent, said a report by the health ministry of the South American nation.Compared to other vaccines in use, there have been few scientific publications on the efficacy of CoronaVac, produced by Chinese firm Sinovac, and widely divergent reported results.Coronavac is nevertheless widely used in China and in some two dozen other countries.Chile reported last month that early results from its immunization campaign showed CoronaVac to be 67 percent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 and 80 percent at preventing death.Trial results with CoronaVac in Brazil showed efficacy of about 50 percent in preventing symptomatic infection, while Turkish data said it was more than 80 percent effective.Uruguay, which started vaccinating on March 1, has used CoronaVac in more than 80 percent of cases.It has reserved the Pfizer-BioNTech jab for older people, health workers, and people other illnesses.The results are based on outcomes two weeks after administering two shots to some 862,000 people — more than 712,000 who received CoronaVac and almost 150,000 Pfizer.The Pfizer shot, the results showed, was 75 percent effective at preventing infection, 99 percent effective at preventing illness requiring ICU admission, and 80 percent effective at preventing death.The results with the two vaccines are not directly comparable, as recipients of Pfizer in Uruguay fell into higher-risk categories, the ministry said.Other studies have attached much better outcomes to Pfizer.The largest real-world Pfizer study yet, in Israel, said this month it provided more than 95 percent protection against Covid-19.CoronaVac is a traditional type of vaccine, using inactivated virus to trigger immunity, while Pfizer uses RNA messenger technology.Uruguay, with a population of 3.5 million, has given at least one vaccine dose to 45.8 percent of the target population and two doses to 28.29 percent by May 25 — placing it third in the Americas behind Chile and the United States.The country has never had a lockdown, and had comparatively few cases in the first months of the outbreak, but in recent weeks led the world in daily deaths per capita.The ministry said the results are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution, as some data has yet to be processed.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-approves-first-new-alzheimers-drug-in-almost-two-decades/,Sinovac’s CoronaVac reduces mortality by 97 percent: Uruguay study,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The United States on Monday approved a drug called Aduhelm to treat patients with Alzheimer’s, the first new medicine against the disease in almost two decades and the first to address cognitive decline linked to the condition.The decision was highly anticipated but also contentious, because an independent expert panel convened by the regulatory Food and Drug Administration last November found insufficient evidence of Aduhelm’s benefit and recommended against approval.“Aduhelm is the first treatment directed at the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease, the presence of amyloid beta plaques in the brain,” said the FDA’s Patrizia Cavazzoni.Nevertheless, the decision falls under the FDA’s “Accelerated Approval” pathway which it uses when it believes a medicine may provide meaningful benefit over existing treatments but there is still some uncertainty.“As is often the case when it comes to interpreting scientific data, the expert community has offered differing perspectives,” said Cavazzoni in a statement acknowledging the controversy.Aduhelm, a monoclonal antibody also known by its generic name aducanumab that is administered intravenously, was tested in two late-stage human trials known as Phase 3 trials.It showed a reduction in cognitive decline in one, but not the other.But in all studies, it convincingly showed a reduction in the build-up of a protein called beta-amyloid in the brain tissue of Alzheimer’s patients.One theory holds that Alzheimer’s disease comes from an excessive accumulation of these proteins in some people’s brains as they age and their immune systems decline.Providing such patients antibodies could therefore be a means to restore some of their capacity to clear the plaque buildup.“We feel a great sense of purpose and responsibility to turn the hope of today’s FDA approval of Aduhelm into a reality for people living with Alzheimer’s disease and their families,” said Alisha Alaimo, president of Biogen US in a statement.She added the company was committed to “health equity” and helping lower-income patients get access to the treatment, delivered once a month.The yearly cost of the treatment would be $56,000, but the cost to US patients would depend on their type of insurance.“On behalf of those impacted by Alzheimer’s & all other dementia, we celebrate today’s historic decision,” tweeted the Alzheimer’s Association, a US nonprofit, in response to the news.Expert reaction was more mixed, with scientists hoping the approval might serve as a catalyst for better drugs to be developed in the future.“While I am pleased that aducanumab has received approval, we have to be clear that, at best, this is a drug with marginal benefit which will help only very carefully selected patients,” said John Hardy, a professor of neuroscience at University College London.“We will need better amyloid drugs down the line,” he added.The last Alzheimer’s drug was approved in 2003, and all previous medicines have targeted symptoms associated with the disease, not its underlying cause.Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia, is thought to affect 50 million people worldwide and usually starts after age 65.It progressively destroys brain tissue, robbing people of their memory, leaving them disoriented and at times unable to carry out everyday tasks.It is also associated with dramatic mood swings and trouble communicating.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/new-oral-experimental-drug-tempol-identified-as-potential-antiviral-drug-for-covid-19/,US approves first new Alzheimer’s drug in almost two decades,1,"The experimental drug TEMPOL may be a promising oral antiviral treatment for COVID-19, suggests a study of cell cultures by researchers at the National Institutes of Health. TEMPOL can limit SARS-CoV-2 infection by impairing the activity of a viral enzyme called RNA replicase. The work was led by researchers at NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The study appears in Science.“We urgently need additional effective, accessible treatments for COVID-19,” said Diana W. Bianchi, M.D., NICHD Director. “An oral drug that prevents SARS-CoV-2 from replicating would be an important tool for reducing the severity of the disease.”The study team was led by Tracey A. Rouault, M.D., head of the NICHD Section on Human Iron Metabolism. It discovered TEMPOL’s effectiveness by evaluating a more basic question on how the virus uses its RNA replicase, an enzyme that allows SARS-CoV-2 to replicate its genome and make copies of itself once inside a cell.Researchers tested whether the RNA replicase (specifically the enzyme’s nsp12 subunit) requires iron-sulfur clusters for structural support. Their findings indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA replicase requires two iron-sulfur clusters to function optimally. Earlier studies had mistakenly identified these iron-sulfur cluster binding sites for zinc-binding sites, likely because iron-sulfur clusters degrade easily under standard experimental conditions.Identifying this characteristic of the RNA replicase also enables researchers to exploit a weakness in the virus. TEMPOL can degrade iron-sulfur clusters, and previous research from the Rouault Lab has shown the drug may be effective in other diseases that involve iron-sulfur clusters. In cell culture experiments with live SARS-CoV-2 virus, the study team found that the drug can inhibit viral replication.Based on previous animal studies of TEMPOL in other diseases, the study authors noted that the TEMPOL doses used in their antiviral experiments could likely be achieved in tissues that are primary targets for the virus, such as the salivary glands and the lungs.“Given TEMPOL’s safety profile and the dosage considered therapeutic in our study, we are hopeful,” said Dr. Rouault. “However, clinical studies are needed to determine if the drug is effective in patients, particularly early in the disease course when the virus begins to replicate.”The study team plans on conducting additional animal studies and will seek opportunities to evaluate TEMPOL in a clinical study of COVID-19.NIH authors on the study include researchers from the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/first-human-case-of-h10n3-bird-flu-what-we-know/,First human case of H10N3 bird flu: What we know,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — China revealed the first human case of H10N3 bird flu on Tuesday, an announcement that has so far raised no alarm among world health authorities.Here is what we know.The case of H10N3 bird flu announced by China on Tuesday is the first of its strain observed in humans.“The patient is a 41-year-old male from Jiangsu Province, China,” the World Health Organization told AFP in an email.“He developed illness on 22 April 2021 and was hospitalised on 28 April in an intensive care unit. He is currently recovering,” it said.China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said the man was diagnosed with H10N3 a month after being hospitalised.“The source of the patient’s exposure to the H10N3 virus is not known at this time,” the WHO said.“Bird flu, or avian flu, is caused by influenza viruses that spread between birds,” said Nicole Robb of the University of Warwick, cited by the Science Media Centre (SMC).“It can often spread easily between birds, but very rarely causes disease in humans,” she said.John W. McCauley of the Francis Crick Institute added: “There is a very wide range of influenza viruses in circulation in birds, much wider than in the main mammalian hosts of influenza: man, pigs and horses.”Two strains of bird flu, H5N1 and H7N9, (first seen in 2013) led to human contamination in Asia through infected birds.Two strains of bird flu, H5N1 and H7N9, led to human contamination in Asia through infected birds.H5N1 first broke out in 1997, then spread between 2003 and 2011, while H7N9 was first seen in 2013.Cases of transmission between humans remain extremely rare.H7N9 has infected 1,668 people and killed 616 since 2013, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization.The H5N8 virus, derived from H5N1, was detected in February among workers at a Russian poultry factory after circulating for a few months in several European farms.McCauley also cites sporadic infection incidents involving the H9N2 and H10N8 viruses across the world over the last 20 years.“Transmission to humans is usually by direct contact,” McCauley says, citing “very close contact with infected birds, poultry or ducks with direct exposure whilst handling them or in preparation of meat from the infected animal”.McCauley points to the H5N1 outbreak in 1997 in Hong Kong that was halted by the closure of bird markets.“Once cooked, infected meat poses a very low threat,” he adds.“As long as avian influenza viruses circulate in poultry, sporadic infection of avian influenza in humans is not surprising,” noted the WHO, “which is a vivid reminder that the threat of an influenza pandemic is persistent.”As for transmission among humans, Vincent Enouf of the Pasteur Institute says: “Mutations would be necessary as the virus crosses the species barrier.”“At this time, there is no indication of human-to-human transmission” of H10N3, the WHO said.“We don’t have any information about mutations of this H10N3 virus that could be useful in determining whether it might have the potential to be transmitted among humans,” Enouf added.“Today Chinese authorities say the virus hasn’t been detected in other people, which is reassuring,” he says.Even among the bird population, where H10N3 has been detected in live bird markets periodically since 2002, the WHO says it is a “low pathogenicity” virus, meaning it causes few signs of illness in its host.Robb said viruses belonging to the H5 or H7 subtypes were “more worrying” as they have proven to evolve into highly dangerous strains.These, she said, “cause fatal disease in birds and can cause serious illness in humans in the rare cases that humans have been infected”.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/more-than-two-billion-covid-vaccines-given-afp/,More than two billion Covid vaccines given worldwide: AFP,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — More than two billion Covid-19 vaccines have been given across the world, according to an AFP tally Thursday drawn from official sources.The milestone comes six months after the first vaccination campaigns against Covid-19 began.At least 2,109,696,022 shots have been given in 215 countries and territories, according to the count from an AFP database taken at 0915 GMT.Israel, which has led the race from the start, is still out in front, with nearly six in 10 people there fully vaccinated.It is followed by Canada (59 percent of the population have had at least one jab), the United Kingdom (58.3 percent), Chile (56.6 percent) and the United States (51 percent).Six out of 10 of the injections have been administered in the world’s three most populous countries — China (704.8 million doses), the US (296.9 million) and India (221 million).Nearly four out of 10 people in the European Union have had at least one shot, with Germany leading with 43.6 percent, followed by Italy (40 percent) and France and Spain on 39.4 percent.Only six countries in the world have not yet started vaccinating — North Korea, Haiti, Tanzania, Chad, Burundi an Eritrea.But with vaccination programmes now accelerating globally, China leads the league of countries giving doses the fastest over the last week, injecting 1.37 percent of its population per day.Bahrain and Uruguay are also covering about one percent a day.Germany is not far off that as the leader of the EU bunch followed by Italy (0.81 percent) and Spain (0.71 percent).Despite being ravaged by the pandemic, the speed of vaccination in India and Brazil has been much slower, covering only 0.19 of the population in India’s case and 0.29 of Brazil’s.In fact there is still huge inequality in the spread of vaccines, with only 2.5 doses per 100 people in Africa against 87 per 100 in the US and Canada and 47 in Europe.The world’s poorest countries have given only 0.3 percent of the jabs while the richest got four out of 10 shots even though they have only 16 percent of the global population.Oxford/AstraZeneca is the most widely given vaccine, administered in 170 of the 215 countries where campaigns have begun.It is followed by Pfizer/BioNTech, which is being used in at least 97 countries; Moderna (at least 46); Sinopharm (45); Sputnik V (40); Johnson & Johnson (29).The Oxford/AstraZeneca shot is also the mainstay of the Covax vaccine sharing programme for poorer countries, while the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna jabs — which are more difficult to store — are the preserve of wealthier countries.Like Russia’s Sputnik V, the Chinese vaccines developed by Sinopharm and Sinovac have been used most by emerging or developing nations.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-origins-mystery-continues-to-spark-speculation-and-tension/,Covid origins mystery continues to spark speculation and tension,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has scorched its way across the world killing millions and bringing economies to a standstill. But where exactly did it come from?With few clear answers, speculation has persisted since the beginning of the pandemic, spawning misinformation and conspiracy theories as well as sharp diplomatic tensions.Here is a look at leads scientists are following — and others they have rejected — in trying to determine how the virus made the leap to humans. Finding the right answer, they say, could help avoid the next pandemic.Bats were identified early on as the probable origin of Covid-19.But scientists think the virus would have passed from the winged mammals to another species before reaching humans.The pangolin was singled out as a suspect because it is one of the wild animal species sold at the market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which was linked to most of the first known cases of coronavirus.However, uncertainty about this theory persists.A joint investigation by World Health Organization (WHO) experts and Chinese scientists who visited Wuhan in January 2021 was supposed to help shed light on the theory but did not find the missing link.Other animal intermediaries have come under suspicion, including minks and the ferret-badger.Another idea floated early on was that the virus did not reach people through animals but was engineered.This idea often went hand-in-hand with the theory that the virus had leaked from a secure biolab in Wuhan. The idea spread widely online with some help from former US president Donald Trump.One version of this theory alleges that the virus was created and spread on purpose.Some internet publications have claimed that the existence of coronavirus patents offer “proof” of this, although in reality they are pointing to patented research on other coronaviruses.The idea that the other pathogens had been spliced into the virus has also proved popular, even though scientists say such genetic manipulation would be visible in the Sars-CoV-2 genome.Professor Olivier Schwartz of the Pasteur institute calls such ideas “completely unfounded”.The idea that a virus of natural origins — taken from a bat, for example — could have escaped from a secure biolab has been under increased consideration in recent weeks.The WHO team that travelled to Wuhan in January said in their report that animal transmission was “likely to very likely” while a lab leak was “extremely unlikely”.But WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus has said the laboratory leak theory “requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy”.In May, a group of 18 experts echoed the sentiment in an editorial that appeared in the journal Science.“We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,” they wrote.“A proper investigation should be transparent, objective, data-driven, inclusive of broad expertise, subject to independent oversight, and responsibly managed to minimise the impact of conflicts of interest.”Citing a US intelligence report, The Wall Street Journal reported in May that three workers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology were hospitalised with a seasonal illness in November 2019, a month before Beijing disclosed the existence of a mysterious pneumonia outbreak.Days later US President Joe Biden gave intelligence agencies three months to report to him on whether the Covid-19 virus first emerged in China from an animal source or from a laboratory accident.Experts point out, however, that the renewed interest in this theory comes from a lack of information — not from new evidence.“There is no new factual element that has moved the needle one way or the other,” says Schwartz at the Pasteur Institute, noting that the natural transmission theory remains “the most plausible” explanation.Assigning blame for the pandemic has had Beijing and Washington eager to point the finger at one another.As host country to the world’s first identified cases, China has come under intense scrutiny.Western countries have accused it of lacking transparency, both in its initial response and in its cooperation with investigations into the origins of the virus.Tensions between the US and China were already high in the spring of 2020 when Trump raised the lab-leak theory — a charge Beijing answered with its own hypothesis that the virus came from an American lab.Last week, WHO emergencies chief Michel Ryan told reporters that the finger-pointing was not helping investigations to go forward.“This whole process is being poisoned by politics,” he warned.The WHO says understanding how an epidemic began is “essential to preventing further introductions to the human population”.But at the end of last year, even before its team embarked to Wuhan, the organisation warned that the process of tracing how a disease jumped from animals “is a riddle that can take years to solve”.“The introduction of a new virus to the human population is one of the greatest mysteries an epidemiologist can hope to unravel,” it said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-approves-chinas-sinovac-covid-jab/,WHO approves China’s Sinovac Covid jab,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization on Tuesday approved the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use — the second Chinese jab to receive the WHO’s green light.The UN health agency signed off on the Beijing-based firm Sinovac’s two-dose vaccine CoronaVac, which is already being deployed in several countries around the world.“I’m happy to announce that the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine has been given WHO emergency use listing after being found to be safe, effective, and quality-assured,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference.“The easy storage requirements of CoronaVac make it very suitable for low-resource settings,” he added.“It’s now crucial to get these life-saving tools to the people that need them quickly.”The WHO said the emergency use listing (EUL) gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that the vaccine has met international standards.Last month Sinopharm became the first Chinese vaccine to be approved by the WHO.The organisation has also given EUL status to vaccines being made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and the AstraZeneca jab being produced in India, South Korea and the EU, which it counts separately.WHO’s listing paves the way for countries worldwide to approve and import a vaccine for distribution quickly, especially those states without an international-standard regulator of their own.It also opens the door for the jabs to enter the Covax global vaccine-sharing facility, which aims to provide equitable access to doses around the world, particularly in poorer countries.Currently only AstraZeneca and some Pfizer jabs are flowing through the scheme.“The world desperately needs multiple Covid-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe,” said Mariangela Simao, the WHO’s assistant director general for access to health products.“We urge manufacturers to participate in the Covax facility, share their know-how and data and contribute to bringing the pandemic under control.”“WHO recommends the vaccine for use in adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of two to four weeks,” the agency said in a statement.“Vaccine efficacy results showed that the vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 51 percent of those vaccinated and prevented severe Covid-19 and hospitalisation in 100 percent of the studied population.”The Sinovac vaccine contains an inactivated form of coronavirus that cannot cause the disease. It also has a substance that helps strengthen the immune response to the vaccine.When given the shot, the immune system identifies the inactivated virus as foreign and makes antibodies against it, which will then recognise the active virus and defend the body against it.Few people aged over 60 took part in the clinical trial of Sinovac’s jab.However, the WHO said there should be no upper age limit on the vaccine as there is “no reason to believe it has a different safety profile” in older generations.The Sinovac jab is already in use in 22 territories around the world, according to an AFP count.Apart from China, the countries using Sinovac include Chile, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand and Turkey.Chen Xu, China’s ambassador in Geneva, said CoronaVac’s EUL status expanded the number of global tools to fight the pandemic.“China will continue to work with the international community to promote the accessibility and affordability of Covid-19 vaccines especially in (the) developing world,” he said in a tweet.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/study-shows-dogs-can-detect-covid-positive-arrivals/,Study shows dogs can detect Covid-positive arrivals,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Dogs can be trained to detect more than 90 percent of Covid-19 infections even when patients are asymptomatic, according to research published Monday, which authors hope could help replace the need to quarantine new arrivals.Using their remarkable sense of smell — which can pick up the equivalent of half a teaspoon of sugar in an olympic-sized swimming pool — dogs have already shown that they can sniff out maladies such as cancer, malaria and epilepsy.Several previous studies have shown proof-of-concept that dogs can detect SARS-CoV-2.Researchers from the London School of Tropical Medicine wanted to see if dogs could detect a distinctive odour given off from chemical compounds associated with someone who is Covid positive but doesn’t show symptoms.They gathered samples of clothing and face masks from people who had tested positive for mild or symptomatic SARS-CoV-2.Samples of the socks of 200 Covid-19 cases were collected and arranged in lab tests for six dogs that had been trained to indicate either a presence or absence of the chemical compound.The dogs needed to be trained not to identify “false positives” in a bid to hack their reward system and obtain treats even if there were no Covid-19 samples in a given test.“This means that the dog fully understands and gets a reward for a correct negative as well as a correct positive,” said Claire Guest, from the school’s Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases.Overall, the dogs were successfully able to identify between 94 and 82 percent of SARS-CoV-2 samples.The researchers then modelled how effectively these success rates, combined with traditional PCR tests, could help detect mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 cases.They found that using dogs to screen arrivals at terminuses such as airports could detect 91 percent of cases, resulting in a 2.24 times lower rate of transmission than with PCR tests alone.Authors of the research, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, said they hoped it could eventually replace the need for travellers to quarantine — which necessarily disrupts every arrival even though the vast majority are not Covid positive.“The key thing is that dogs are significantly quicker than other tests,” said co-author James Logan.“What we’re suggesting is that dogs would give the first initial screening, and then those (arrivals) that were indicated as positive would then receive a complimentary PCR test.”The team said that out of a plane full of arrivals — around 300 people — less than one percent were statistically likely to be carrying SARS-CoV-2.Under current quarantine regulations employed by some countries, all 300 would need to isolate, causing significant inconvenience.But given the sensitivity of trained dogs, a maximum of 35 people on board would be indicated as positive, the paper said.Of these, only around 3 would be expected to return a positive PCR test.“This is a really important start and could lead to a useful, usable system,” said Mick Bailey, professor of Comparative Immunology at the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the research.“But there’s a lot more validation needs to be done before we could be confident that the dogs can reliably and specifically detect asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in people in airports and train stations.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/new-cdc-study-in-health-workers-shows-94-efficacy-of-covid-19-mrna-vaccines/,New CDC study in health workers shows 94% efficacy of Covid-19 mRNA vaccines,1,"https://youtu.be/VI3Ye2gcvak(Eagle News) — A new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on a group of health care workers showed that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are effective in protecting health care personnel (HCP) against COVID-19 by as much as 94 percent.In a release from the US CDC, it said that the mRNA vaccines Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna “reduced the risk of getting sick with COVID-19 by 94% among HCP who were fully vaccinated.”“This report provided the most compelling information to date that COVID-19 vaccines were performing as expected in the real world,” said CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, MD, MPH. “This study, added to the many studies that preceded it, was pivotal to CDC changing its recommendations for those who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.”This assessment, conducted in a different study network with a larger sample size from across a broader geographic area than in the clinical trials, independently confirms U.S. vaccine effectiveness findings among health care workers that were first reported March 29, it said.Data for the new study came from a network covering 500,000 HCP across 33 sites in 25 U.S. states. This provides additional robust evidence that mRNA vaccines are effective against symptomatic illness in real-world conditions, the CDC explained.“The assessment compared vaccination status of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (cases) with vaccination status of those who tested negative (controls). Among the 1,843 participants, there were 623 cases and 1,220 controls. Vaccine effectiveness estimates were calculated by comparing the odds of COVID-19 vaccination in cases and controls. The large sample size in this study allowed for a precise vaccine effectiveness estimate with narrower confidence intervals than earlier CDC findings published March 29.”The CDC assessment found that COVID-19 symptomatic illness was reduced by 94% among HCP who were fully vaccinated, defined in this study as seven or more days after receipt of a second vaccine dose, and by 82% among those who were partially vaccinated, defined in this study as 14 days after receipt of dose one through six days after dose two. It noted the importance of getting two doses of the vaccine “to get the most protection.”“Understanding vaccine effectiveness among HCP is important because they are at higher risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through patient interactions. Vaccination of HCP protects them and their patients against COVID-19 and ensures continuation of critical health care services.”“This assessment is part of CDC’s comprehensive strategy of using complementary methods to understand how COVID-19 vaccines are working in different populations and real-world settings. On May 12, CDC expanded COVID-19 vaccination recommendations to include adolescents 12 years through 15 years of age under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization. These adolescents are now authorized to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. CDC has several surveillance networks that will continue to assess how well FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are working in real-world conditions in people of different age groups, including children and adolescents.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/dont-vaccinate-kids-but-give-doses-to-covax-who-chief/,Don’t vaccinate kids,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The WHO urged wealthy countries Friday to stop vaccinating children against Covid-19 and instead donate doses to poorer nations, while warning that the pandemic’s second year looked set to be more deadly.World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus voiced outrage that a number of rich countries were now vaccinating children and teenagers, while poorer states had barely begun vaccinating health workers and the most vulnerable groups.Instead of offering jabs to young and healthy people, he called on countries to give their doses to the Covax global vaccine-sharing scheme and thereby ensure that those most in need in all countries receive protection.“In January, I spoke about the potential unfolding of a moral catastrophe,” he told a press conference.“Unfortunately, we’re now witnessing this play out. In a handful of rich countries, which bought up the majority of the supply, lower-risk groups are now being vaccinated.“I understand why some countries want to vaccinate their children and adolescents, but right now I urge them to reconsider and to instead donate vaccines to Covax.“Because in low and lower-middle income countries, Covid-19 vaccine supply has not been enough to even immunise healthcare workers, and hospitals are being inundated with people that need lifesaving care urgently.” Nearly 1.4 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been injected in at least 210 territories around the world, according to an AFP count.Some 44 percent of the doses have been administered in high-income countries accounting for 16 percent of the global population.Just 0.3 percent have been administered in the 29 lowest-income countries, home to nine percent of the world’s population. In the face of this inequity in access, Tedros warned that the world would likely see more deaths this year than last, despite the arrival of vaccines.“We’re on track for the second year of this pandemic to be far more deadly than the first,” he said.“Saving lives and livelihoods with a combination of public health measures and vaccination — not one or the other — is the only way out.”The novel coronavirus has killed at least 3.3 million people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.Tedros, 56, meanwhile said that he had been vaccinated against Covid-19 earlier this week in Geneva, the Swiss city where the WHO is based.“It was a bittersweet moment,” he said, explaining that his thoughts were with health workers around the world who had been battling the pandemic.“The fact that so many are still not protected is a sad reflection on the gross distortion in access to vaccines across the globe,” Tedros said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/experts-call-for-new-standards-to-combat-airborne-disease/,but give doses to Covax: WHO chief,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Building standards need to undergo a “paradigm shift” to better protect against airborne diseases, a group of experts said Thursday, drawing on hard-won lessons from the Covid pandemic.Future building designs must incorporate increased ventilation and air-cleaning measures, including filtration and disinfection using both filters and ultraviolet devices, they wrote in the journal Science.This comes as accumulating data suggest that tiny particles containing the coronavirus that are released by breathing, speaking, sneezing, and coughing are a major driver of Covid spread.The 39 experts, who include some of the world’s foremost environmental engineers, noted that there was a marked disparity in the way governments regulated food safety, sanitation and drinking water compared to airborne pathogens.Aerial transmission of diseases wasn’t recognized for a long time, the authors wrote, because “it is much harder to trace airborne infections,” while food and water contamination nearly always come from an easily identifiable source.“Airborne studies are much more difficult to conduct because air as a contagion medium is nebulous, widespread, not owned by anybody and uncontained.”What’s more, “most modern building construction has occurred subsequent to a decline in the belief that airborne pathogens are important” and therefore lack design and construction elements to mitigate the risk.“The ventilation rate will differ for different venues according to the activities conducted there,” they said, with higher rates required for exercising in gyms compared to resting in movie theaters.Rates will also have to differ depending on the type of pathogen that is currently prevalent, given that emission rates and infectious doses vary.It is also important to add control systems to adjust energy use and prevent air pollution from outside contaminants indoors, the paper added.The authors called for global indoor air quality standards (IAQ) led by the World Health Organization and the development of comprehensive standards by national governments and professional bodies.They also called for wide use of monitors, so that members of the public are aware of the air quality in the indoor spaces they share.“A paradigm shift is needed on the scale that occurred when Chadwick’s Sanitary Report in 1842 led the British government to encourage cities to organize clean water supplies and centralized sewage systems,” they concluded.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/doctors-sound-alarm-over-5-fold-jump-in-kids-swallowing-magnets-from-toys/,Experts call for new standards to combat airborne disease,1,"Doctors from major hospitals in England sounded an alarm on Wednesday over a fivefold increase in the number of young children requiring medical treatment after swallowing magnets from toys.Nearly half of these kids aged four months and up required surgery to remove the magnets, often followed by complications, they reported in a research letter published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, a medical journal.From 2016 through 2020, four major hospitals in southeastern England admitted 251 children who had swallowed a foreign object.Coins accounted for 37 percent of the items ingested, ahead of magnets (21 percent) and button batteries (17 percent).Across all categories, the number of cases increased by more than half over this period.But those involving magnets — mostly brightly coloured, matchstick-like pieces found in building sets — jumped five fold, they reported.More than 40 percent of these incidents required surgery for removal.“This was either laparoscopy — also known as ‘key-hole’ surgery — or open abdominal surgery to retrieve the magnets from the intestine,” Hemanshoo Thakkar, a paediatric surgeon at Evelina London Children’s Hospital, told AFP.In half of the cases, there were complications.“As the children suffer from a perforation, their abdomen becomes contaminated and this can result in ongoing infections,” Thakkar explained. “Some children have lost some of their bowel, which has to be removed if unhealthy.”The most serious case involved a youngster who underwent several operations, stayed in intensive care for a month, and in hospital for nearly five months.No deaths were reported. “But left untreated, the injuries caused can be life-threatening,” Thakkar said.In Britain, regulations require that all magnetic toys be accompanied by a warning notice, but most manufacturers do not display them prominently enough, the authors wrote.In a case reported earlier this year in the Journal of Emergency Medicine, a three-year old boy in the United States swallowed six magnetized pieces one after the other. Two of them stuck together in his throat, and the rest settled in his abdomen.Bryan Rudolph, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore in New York City, estimated in a commentary last year that there have been nearly 20,000 magnet injuries in the US since magnetised toys entered the market more than a decade ago.The suitable age for use of such construction or desk toys is often 14 and older, but the average age of children who swallowed them in England was seven. Ages ranged from four months to 16 years old.Thakkar speculated that the sharp uptick in magnet-related incidents had to do with marketing.“The most common magnets we have seen are sold as a shape-changer that can be molded,” he explained, noting that the objects are small, brightly coloured and attractive to children.“There has been a surge of digital influencers online, with children promoting toys and a lack of robust regulation, leading to the popularization of these toys,” he added.The doctors recommended an aggressive public health campaign to educate parents and daycare professionals on the danger of small, powerful magnets integrated into toys. Manufacturers, they added, should be required to provide clear warnings on packages.Aside from magnets, most foreign objects swallowed by children pass through and exit the digestive tract without harm, the study said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/malnutrition-strikes-children-in-dr-congos-fragile-kasai-region/,Doctors sound alarm over 5-fold jump in kids swallowing magnets from toys,1,"MBUJI-MAYI, DR Congo (AFP) — Claudine Kamwanya’s twins are barely two but have the ethereal look of the very old.Wizened features and saucer-like eyes peer from their tiny emaciated faces.“How can I satisfy their hunger?” Kamwanya, who has two other children and is pregnant with a fifth, asks helplessly. “My husband doesn’t work and I sell only water.”Acute malnutrition stalks the diamond-rich but fragile Kasai region in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) — the world’s worst-hit country in terms of food insecurity, according to the UN.Worried for her infants, Kamwanya has sought help at a hospital in Bonzola near the town of Mbuji-Mayi.In an adjoining room, Marie-Jose, a girl aged four and a half, is slowly recovering after 12 days of treatment — a recovery that delights the medical staff.“She was brought here unconscious with severe dehydration associated with infections,” said a nurse.Between April 14 and May 1, “29 malnourished children were admitted, including six in a very serious state,” said Dr. Gregoire Mpoyi, thanking a charity, Action Contre la Faim (ACF, Action Against Hunger), for its support.When the DRC makes the headlines internationally, it is typically for violence in its mineral-rich east, where more than 100 armed groups roam.Less well known is its crisis of hunger, especially in the Kasai, the heart of a vast country that is the size of continental Western Europe.Some 27.3 million people in the DRC are affected by food insecurity, the United Nations said in early April.“This situation has made the DRC the country with the most number of people needing urgent food assistance in the world,” its Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Food Programme said, sounding the alarm.In Mbuji-Mayi, about 15 children with skeletal bodies lie under a mosquito net in the pediatric ward of the general hospital, watched over by their impassive mothers.“Four are in the phase of severe acute malnutrition (the most serious), five are in transition and six are in rehabilitation or are recovering,” said Pierre Kasongo, the head of this hospital run by nuns.“Malnutrition is a scourge that is flourishing in our poverty-stricken community,” he said.In three weeks, his hospital has treated over 60 children. The facility is one of 35 that is supported by ACF.Mado Kapinga sits by the side of her little son, Ntumba Kabengela, who is slowly on the mend.“When we came here, he was really suffering and very weak. He is better after three days’ treatment,” says Kapinga, a mother-of-five and the wife of an artisanal miner.She dreads going home.“Here they give us everything: food, water and even soap to wash ourselves. Once back at home, we will have nothing to eat and my son could have a relapse,” she says.The vast Kasai region is still recovering from fighting in 2016-2017 sparked by the death of a local chief, Kamuina Nsapu, by the DRC security forces.An insurrection by his followers triggered a conflict that claimed 3,400 lives, left 1.5 million people internally displaced and prompted 35,000 others to flee to neighbouring Angola.Kasai’s economy is in tatters, and few are willing to tend its dour clayey soil to grow crops.Many more turn to informal mining in the hope of overnight riches, although it hardly works that way.“People don’t work, they don’t want to farm. The overwhelming majority dream of making a fortune through diamonds, even though it’s obvious — you don’t just bend down and pick up diamonds,” says Carine Kupela, a nun who is the hospital’s general administrator.The neighbouring province of Kasai-Central has also been hit by hunger.Sitting on her mother’s lap, Jeannette Kabuma eats porridge distributed by a nurse to about 20 children at a hospital in Kananga, the provincial capital.Aged one, Jeannette weighs only 5.4 kilograms (11.9 pounds) against the normal average of between seven and 11 for her age.She is suffering from severe acute malnutrition, according to nurse Maman Denise.The health centre in Kamayi had treated 74 children between October and March. Only 47 of them were declared cured.Anto Kalonga, 23, arrives with three children. Two are pot-bellied and have brittle and yellowing hair — classic signs of malnutrition — while the third has trouble breathing.“He doesn’t even have the strength to cry,” says Kalonga.In health centres run by the UN children’s agency Unicef, mothers are taught how to make porridge with locally available produce such as maize, peanuts, palm oil and caterpillars.“The moment a project stops, it’s back to square one,” says Elie Mayiza Bamvangila, a Unicef worker in Kanaga.“The return of displaced people has become a burden for the community,” he adds.On the outskirts of the city, more than 2,200 displaced families are sheltering in camps.Since 2019, Vanessa Zawadi from an NGO called Women for Peace and Dignity employs mothers of malnourished children to work on farmland.Every day, she said, she used to to buy one or two coffins to bury malnourished children.“The parents wanted me to be like other organisations which hand out food… but I make them aware of the importance of growing food or fish farming.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/pfizer-biontech-jab-confirmed-to-protect-95-in-largest-study-yet/,Pfizer/BioNTech jab confirmed to protect 95% in largest study yet,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — The largest real-world study yet of the Pfizer/BioNTec vaccine on Thursday confirmed that the jab provided more than 95 percent protection against Covid-19, but found that the level dropped significantly when people received just one of the two prescribed doses.The authors of the research from Israel’s national vaccination campaign said it showed real-world proof that the pandemic could be ended by rapid, global vaccination programmes.An analysis of public health data from Israel — one of the countries with the highest proportion of fully-vaccinated adults — showed the vaccine was extremely effective in protecting even elderly individuals at a time when the more infectious English variant was dominant, according to the results published in the Lancet medical journal.By the start of April, nearly 5 million people in Israel had received two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, more than 70 percent of the population.The study found that two doses conveyed 95.3 percent protection against infection and 96.7 protection against death seven days after the second dose.After 14 days, that protection increased to 96.5 percent and 98 percent, respectively.But the protection was considerably lower when people received just a single vaccine dose.Between seven and 14 days after the first dose, protection against infection was found to be 57.7 percent, and protection against death 77 percent.The authors said that one dose may provide a shorter window of protection, especially in an environment where new viral variants emerge.“Importantly, the study shows that two doses of the vaccine significantly increase levels of immunity and protection,” said Jonathan Ball, professor of Molecular Virology at the University of Nottingham, who was not involved in the research.“This is why it is important that people get both doses.”During the analysis period, there were 232,268 confirmed Covid-19 infections, and nearly 95 percent of samples tested were found to be the English B117 variant. There were 4,481 severe infections and 1,113 deaths.The team behind the research said that they were not able to study the effect of the South African variant, which has also been identified in Israel.Before Thursday, the largest real-world study of the Pfizer/BioNTec vaccine, also in Israel, was nearly five times smaller, involving 1.2 million people.Writing in a comment article, Eyal Lesham of the Chaim Sheba Medical Centre and Annelies Wilder-Smith of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the study findings “suggest that high vaccine coverage rates could offer a way out of the pandemic”.“Regrettably, rapid population-level coverage cannot be easily replicated in many other countries,” said the pair, who were not involved in the Lancet study.“The global use of (Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccine is limited by supply issues, high costs, and ultra-cold chain storage requirements.”© Agence France-Presse"

She was initially believed to have been carrying septuplets.Cases of women successfully carrying septuplets to term are rare — and nonuplets even rarer.Moroccan health ministry spokesman Rachid Koudhari said he had no knowledge of such a multiple birth having taken place in one of the country’s hospitals.But Mali’s health ministry said in a statement that Cisse had given birth to five girls and four boys by Caesarean section.“The mother and babies are doing well so far,” Mali’s Health Minister Fanta Siby told AFP, adding that she had been kept informed by the Malian doctor who accompanied Cisse to Morocco.They are due to return home in several weeks’ time, she added.Doctors had been concerned about Cisse’s health, according to local press reports, as well as her babies’ chances of survival.Mali’s health ministry said in a statement that ultrasound examinations conducted in both Mali and Morocco had suggested that Cisse was carrying seven babies.Siby offered her congratulations to “the medical teams of Mali and Morocco, whose professionalism is at the origin of the happy outcome of this pregnancy”.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/moderna-vaccine-gets-who-approval-for-emergency-use-listing-eul/,Moderna vaccine gets WHO approval for emergency use listing (EUL),1,"(Eagle News) – The Moderna vaccine against COVID-19 has been listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO).In a statement dated April 30, WHO said that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA 1273) has been approved for listing “for emergency use, making it the fifth vaccine to receive emergency validation from WHO.”With this WHO approval for Emergency Use Listing (EUL), it would allow other countries to “expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer” the Moderna vaccine.The EUL is also a prerequisite for Moderna vaccine to be included among the vaccines being distributed under the COVAX Facility. WHO experts recommended that Moderna be used for those aged 18 and above.“The vaccine has already been reviewed by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), which makes recommendations for vaccines’ use in populations (i.e. recommended age groups, intervals between shots, advice for specific groups such as pregnant and lactating women). The SAGE recommended the vaccine for all age groups 18 and above in its interim recommendations dated 25 January 2021,” it said.WHO noted Moderna’s 94.1 percent efficacy against COVID-19, and also its temperature requirements wherein the vaccine vials can be stored in refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius up to 30 days “prior to withdrawal of the first dose.” The vaccines require storage of negative 25 degrees Celsius to negative 15 degrees Celsius.“The Moderna vaccine is an mNRA-based vaccine. It was found by the SAGE to have an efficacy of 94.1%, based on a median follow-up of two months. Although the vaccine is provided as a frozen suspension at –25 ºC to –15 ºC in a multidose vial, vials can be stored refrigerated at 2–8 °C for up to 30 days prior to withdrawal of the first dose, meaning that ultra-cold chain equipment may not always be necessary to deploy the vaccine,” WHO said in a statement.The US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the Moderna vaccine on Dec. 18 December last year. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also issued a marketing authorization for Moderna valid throughout the European Union on Jan. 6.Moderna has already applied for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) with the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA).WHO has already approved for emergency use listing the following vaccines: Pfizer/BioNTech, Astrazeneca-SK Bio, Covishield of Serum Institute of India and Janssen of Johnson and Johnson."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/medical-oxygen-why-it-is-lacking-and-how-it-is-made/,Medical oxygen: Why it is lacking and how it is made,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Difficulty breathing is one of the most common severe Covid-19 symptoms, and as photos of people waiting in long lines for oxygen canisters in India and elsewhere attest, supplies of medical oxygen are far from adequate everywhere in the world.– Why the long waits for oxygen in developing nations? – India is only the latest country to confront a lack of medical oxygen supplies. Earlier in the pandemic there were similar scenes of long lines in countries such as Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Peru and Venezuela.Unitaid, a global initiative that helps low- and middle-income countries confront public health challenges, puts the lack of supplies of medical oxygen down to its cost, limited infrastructure and logistical difficulties.Medical oxygen is key to treating people in respiratory distress, whether at home or in hospitals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one person in five suffering from Covid-19 needs medical oxygen to ensure that the level of oxygen in their blood is sufficient.– How much is needed in countries facing shortages? – In February, the WHO estimated that half a million people needed 1.2 million oxygen canisters a day.Unitaid put the price tag of helping the countries facing the greatest need at $1.6 billion this year.“This is a global emergency that needs a truly global response,” said Unitaid’s Executive Director, Dr Philippe Duneton, in February.It has identified some 20 countries facing the greatest difficulties with oxygen supplies, including Malawi, Nigeria and Afghanistan.Oxygen is made in two ways:– Medical oxygen: is made by separating the oxygen from other gases and impurities found in air by repeated steps of compression, filtration and purification, according to Air Liquide Sante France.Such medical oxygen reaches more than 99.5 percent purity and is rigorously tested.It can be highly compressed into a liquid form, but has to be maintained below -182°C, which according to Air Liquide Sante France is the best way to meet variations in demand as one litre of liquid oxygen is the equivalent to around 800 litres when it is in normal gas form.Canisters that can travel with patients with one litre of compressed litres of oxygen contain about 200 litres of normal oxygen.– Compressed oxygen: machines that can separate out nitrogen from ambient air can raise oxygen levels to around 93 percent. The machines can be portable or larger to serve a hospital. However, these machines cannot meet surges in demand — which rose by a factor of five or six in French hospitals as waves of Covid patients peaked. They are require lots of electricity and need to be regularly maintained by a technician.Outside of China, the three main producers of medical oxygen are the German firm Linde, which is allied with Praxair in the US; the French firm Air Liquide and the US company Air Products.But there are a large number of local and regional producers of medical oxygen given that it is difficult to shop long distances.Industrialised countries are better served as production facilities were designed to serve more than just the medical sector, such as the steel and chemicals industries.– What’s being done for India? – The Indian military has used its cargo aircraft to transport oxygen tanker trucks where supplies are lacking, and a train called the Oxygen Express was put into service on April 22.The military has also said it plans to import 23 mobile production units from Germany.France plans to send eight such units that will be able to produce enough oxygen to serve 10,000 patients a day. It also plans to ship 200 tonnes of liquid oxygen to Indian hospitals.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-jab-experts-want-more-az-clot-data-from-outside-europe/,WHO jab experts want more AZ clot data from outside Europe,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization’s vaccine advisors called Thursday for more data on the incidence of blood clots in people who received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine outside Europe.The WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunisation updated their guidance on the use of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus jab, rewriting the section on precautions in light of data from Europe on clotting.“WHO continues to support the conclusion that the benefits of these vaccines outweigh the risks,” the UN agency stressed in a statement.On April 7, SAGE said a link between AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 jabs and blood clots was plausible but unconfirmed, underlining that reported occurrences were “very rare”.In light of evidence emerging from ongoing vaccination programmes, they have updated their recommendations on the AstraZeneca jab, which is being deployed in 157 territories according to an AFP count.SAGE said most clotting cases were reported in Britain and the European Union, with very few cases noted in other countries.They said it was unknown whether there was a risk of clotting from the second dose of the vaccine, while recommending that those who suffered blood clots after their first injection should not be given the second dose of the two-shot vaccine. “A very rare syndrome of blood clotting combined with low platelet counts, described as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), has been reported around four to 20 days following vaccination,” the new guidance says.“A causal relationship between the vaccine and TTS is considered plausible although the biological mechanism for this syndrome is still being investigated.“Most of these cases were reported from the UK and the EU. There is considerable geographic variation with regards to the reported incidence, with very few cases reported from non-European countries, despite extensive use of the vaccine.“An estimation of the risk outside Europe needs further data collection and analysis.”The vaccine currently forms the backbone of the Covax scheme, which ensures that poorer countries can access doses, with donors covering the cost.Covax has so far shipped more than 40.5 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to 118 participating territories.The SAGE guidance said that data from Britain, dated March 31, suggested the risk of TTS was approximately one case per 250,000 vaccinated adults, while the rate in the EU was estimated at one in 100,000.It said current data from Europe suggested that the risk might be higher in younger adults compared with older adults.“No specific risk factors have yet been identified,” it said. Whilst stressing that the benefit of vaccination against Covid-19 “far outweighs” the risks, the assessment may differ between countries.“Countries should consider their epidemiological situation, individual and population-level risks, availability of other vaccines, and alternate options for risk mitigation,” the guidance said.“The benefit-risk ratio is greatest in older age groups.“It is currently unknown whether there is a risk of TTS following the second dose.”The safety surveillance and monitoring section was also rewritten,recommending research into serious adverse events including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombotic events with thrombocytopenia.It also called for research into the incidence of TTS by region, age and sex."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/phl-doctor-explains-what-people-can-do-amid-evidence-of-airborne-transmission-of-covid-virus/,PHL doctor explains what people can do amid evidence of airborne transmission of COVID virus,1,"(Eagle News) – The public should take extra precautions to protect themselves from COVID-19 after scientific evidence showing that COVID-19 is now not just spread through droplets, close contact, or even by touching infected surface, but through the air.Airborne transmission of COVID-19 means that the virus can be spread in farther distances (more than six feet) and can stay in the air for longer periods of time, said pulmonologist, Dr. Eileen Aniceto, secretary of the Philippine College of Chest Physicians, who manages the emergency medicine and outpatient department at the Lung Center of the Philippines.“Evidence is showing that there is airborne transmission,” said Dr. Aniceto, in an interview with Eagle News Service’s “Balitalakayan” on NET 25 Wednesday, April 21.This makes the challenge of preventing COVID-19 transmission more difficult.“ intervention is ventilation,” Dr. Aniceto noted.She explained that the COVID-19 virus can be spread through aerosolized infected particles, which are less than 1 micron in diameter, a size too small that it is spread faster, and farther, and even stays in the air longer.This is unlike droplets, which are almost visible to eye, because they are larger at more than 1 micron in diameter.One micron is equivalent to .001 millimeter. Aerosolized particles are less than this in size, thus the danger.When an infected person sneezes, he or she spreads infectious particles through droplets and through infectious aerosolized particles (less than 1 micron) that are infected. Whereas droplets from an infectious person who sneeze can land on nearby surfaces because they are bigger and heavier, aerosolized infectious particles from that action of sneezing spread farther at more than six feet, and even circulates in the air. Because these ultra-small infectious aerosol particles are much lighter, they just spread farther and circulate in the air, and thus could be inhaled by another person.“These particles are just suspended in the air. (They stay longer in the air),” noted Dr. Aniceto in the interview.This is where good ventilation – opening windows for better airflow – helps.An airconditioning system that filters or cleans the air, and portable air cleaner that sucks the air inside a room, and cleans it, also help, Dr. Aniceto said. It is also good to have UV disinfection once a day to kill the viruses in the air.In the interview, Dr. Aniceto explained that the aerosolized infected particles that just circulate in the air in an enclosed space or room also eventually land on surfaces such as tables, desktops, computers, cellphones, chairs, to name a few, and infect those who will touch these surfaces.“If they eventually land on surfaces, (there would be) fomite on surfaces,” she said.In medicine, fomites are inanimate objects or materials that can carry and spread disease and infectious agents.Dr. Aniceto said that aerosolized infectious particles also spread the virus especially in mass gatherings – both in open and closed spaces. This is also because of the nature of these aerosol particles that can travel farther and can stay suspended in the air longer.“evidence proving that it’s airborne. They tested the air. This is the first time . Transmission in concerts, both in open or closed settings,” she said.“o (There is clustering of cases) coming from mass gatherings. (In quarantine facilities, there is also infection),” she said in the Balitalakayan interview.“They actually tested air filters and building ducts and they were able to isolate the virus there,” she said citing a study involving infected caged animals in different areas connected through airducts.Because of this evidence of airborne transmission of the virus, people should be more obsessive compulsive with regards to hygiene, she said. They should observe minimum health protocols more strictly and more conscientiously, conscious of the airborne transmissibility of the virus.For example, she said, inside a room, a person thinking that he is alone, removes his mask, and then sneezes. If that person has COVID-19 and doesn’t know it, those infectious droplets land on surfaces, and the aerosolized infectious particles travel in the air. Even if he leaves the room, these infectious aerosol particles can be inhaled by other persons who will subsequently enter the room if they don’t wear masks.These can also enter the eye if they don’t wear face shields. The fomites on objects due to the infections particles that eventually land on surfaces can also infect people who touch them, if they don’t wash their hands before they touch their nose, mouth or eyes. Here the importance of frequent and proper handwashing, and sanitation or disinfection of surfaces come in.A common mistake is also to remove masks when a person thinks that it is safe to do so because he or she is alone in the room. It is important before doing so to disinfect surfaces, and to clean the air, or open windows for proper ventilation.“Same lang ang health protocols, tighter lang. Kailangan ipaintindi kung paano nakakahawa ang Sars-Cov-2,” Dr. Aniceto said referring to the virus that causes COVID-19.The problem is compounded with the increasing number of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19. These persons, even before that they know or suspect that they have the virus, can already spread it around in their work area, and among their family members who are likewise unsuspecting because they don’t show symptoms. They touch surfaces, touch their loved ones, and also spread virus through the air.“Unfortunately, (Unfortunately, we have what we call asymptomatic transmission. This means, the person can already infect others even before he feels any symptoms) That’s another evidence for airborne transmission. (He does not cough, so there are no droplets, but he can already be infectious)” Dr. Aniceto explained in the Balitalakayan interview.She said that two days before the onset of symptoms, the asymptomatic person can already infect others with COVID-19.“. (That asymptomatic person has been spreading the virus two days before he experiences symptoms of sore throat, and when he undergoes testing, it’s COVID) everybody (It’s too late. Everybody has been exposed),”Those with comorbidities and the elderly, who usually just stay inside their homes are the people most vulnerable to this.“There are some of the evidence that show us that it is indeed airborne already. So there is consistent and strong evidence that SarsCov2 is spread also by airborne, also by droplet, also by contact, and also by fomite. So these are all means of transmission,” Dr. Aniceto said.She also pointed out that hospitals are already full and overwhelmed; thus, it would be best for the public to be more careful and conscientious, and to strictly follow health protocols so they and their loved ones won’t get sick. (Let’s not do shortcuts). Let’s do what is necessary,” she said referring to the strict observance of health protocols. “This is also for your own protection, and for the protection of your family,” she added."

Each 0.5 mL dose of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is formulated to contain 5×1010 virus particles of the Ad26 vector encoding the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2,” the FDA stated in the EUA issued to the Janssen vaccine.“Johnson and Johnson (Philippines), Inc. shall have a comprehensive pharmacovigilance system for Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine following system or protocol for a registered drug and biologic product as stated in the FDA Circular No. 2020-003. Submission of serious and non-serious adverse reaction reports is mandatory,” it said.The FDA said that in the absence of an agreement with the Department of Health and the National Task Force, “Johnson and Johnson (Philippines), Inc. shall provide appropriate cold chain requirements for storage, transport and handling until it is delivered to the inoculation sites.”The FDA said that the company should “also ensure that a contingency plan is in place.”The government agency is also requiring the Johnson and Johnson (Philippines) Inc., to have “a system of monitoring to ensure traceability and that the vaccine is consistent with the storage requirements from the manufacture and transport to the inoculation sites.”The vaccine can be stored in refrigerator temperature of between 2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius.With the grant of EUA to the Janssen vaccine against COVID-19, the FDA has issued a total of five EUA to COVID-19 vaccines. The first was for Pfizer, followed by AstraZeneca, Coronavac of Sinovac, and Russia’s Sputnik V vaccines.On April 13, Johnson and Johnson issued a statement announcing a “pause in the use of our vaccine” as recommvended by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the US Food and Drug Administration as part of its precautionary measures.“The safety and well-being of the people who use our products is our number one priority. We are aware of an extremely rare disorder involving people with blood clots in combination with low platelets in a small number of individuals who have received our COVID-19 vaccine,” it said.It said that the US CDC and the US FDA were reviewing data involving six reported U.S. cases out of more than 6.8 million doses administered in the US.Both the US and Europe’s drug regulator, European Medicines Agency, are expected to rule on the safety of the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.The European Medicines Agency is due to hold a press conference from Amsterdam on Tuesday, after reviewing four cases — one fatal — of rare blood clots reported among people who got the J&J shot.The US, on the other hand, is expected to make its announcement regarding the J&J shot on Friday."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pfizer-ceo-vaccine-third-dose-likely-needed-within-12-months/,Pfizer CEO: Vaccine third dose ‘likely’ needed within 12 months,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The head of Pfizer said in an interview aired Thursday that people will “likely” need a third dose of his company’s Covid-19 shot within six to 12 months of vaccination, while elsewhere defending the relatively higher cost of the jab.CEO Albert Bourla also said annual vaccinations against the coronavirus may well be required.“We need to see what would be the sequence, and for how often we need to do that, that remains to be seen,” Bourla told CNBC in an interview recorded on April 1.“A likely scenario is that there will be likely a need for a third dose, somewhere between six and 12 months and then from there, there will be an annual revaccination, but all of that needs to be confirmed,” he said, adding that variants will play a “key role.”“It is extremely important to suppress the pool of people that can be susceptible to the virus,” he said.Researchers currently don’t know how long vaccines provide protection against the coronavirus.Pfizer published a study earlier this month that said its jab is more than 91 percent effective at protecting against the coronavirus, and more than 95 percent effective against severe cases of Covid-19 up to six months after the second dose.But researchers say more data is needed to determine whether protection lasts after six months.David Kessler, the head of US President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 response team, warned a congressional committee on Thursday that Americans should expect to receive booster shots to defend against coronavirus variants.“We don’t know everything at this moment,” he told the House Coronavirus Crisis Subcommittee. “We are studying the durability of the antibody response.“It seems strong but there is some waning of that and no doubt the variants challenge” that, he said.“I think for planning purposes, planning purposes only, I think we should expect that we may have to boost.”Bourla also on Thursday defended the price of his company’s vaccine, saying they are saving lives and will not be sold to poor countries for a profit. “Vaccines are very expensive,” Bourla said in an interview with several European news outlets.“They save human lives, they allow economies to reopen, but we sell them at the price of a meal,” he was quoted as saying.According to data released several months ago by a member of the Belgian government, the Pfizer coronavirus jab has been the most expensive one for the European Union, along with the vaccine by Moderna.Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov explained earlier this week that the vaccine’s price was rising as sales were being negotiated, costing as much as 19.50 euros ($23), up from 12 euros.The prices are in sharp contrast to the vaccine produced by British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca, which vowed not to make a profit on its product during the pandemic and sold it to the EU for less than two euros a unit.Bourla did not confirm the price of the Pfizer vaccine but admitted that it was sold at a higher price to developed countries like those in the EU or the United States.“In middle-income countries, we sell it for half the price,” he said.“In poorer countries, including in Africa, we sell it at cost.”The Pfizer vaccine, developed by the US-based company in partnership with German firm BioNTech, currently plays a leading role in American and European vaccination campaigns.The pharmaceutical giant announced in February that it was testing a third dose of its vaccine to better combat the emerging variants.And Bourla said Thursday the company was working on a new formula that would allow the vaccine to be stored for four to six months at a normal temperature, rather than the minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit) or below currently required."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/the-brazil-variant-what-we-know/,The Brazil variant: what we know,1,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AFP) — The “Brazil variant” — a more contagious mutation of the coronavirus that emerged in the Amazon late last year — is fueling fears the pandemic could flare anew, leading several countries to suspend flights from Brazil.Here is a rundown of what we know — and don’t — about the variant known as P1.There are still a lot of unknowns about P1.Two certainties, though: it is more contagious than the initial strain of the novel coronavirus, and it can re-infect people who have had the original.“The fear is justified. P1 is a more contagious variant, and it has spread rapidly across Brazil, which is an enormous country. The pandemic is out of control in Brazil right now,” said microbiologist Natalia Pasternak.Covid-19 claimed 66,500 lives in Brazil last month — more than double what had previously been the country’s deadliest month in the pandemic, July 2020.With Brazil’s total death toll now at 358,000 — second only to the United States — April is on track to be even worse.It is unclear to what extent P1 is causing the surging death toll. Experts suspect it is more virulent than the original strain but say more research is needed.Researchers say P1 emerged in December last year in or around the northern city of Manaus.But it was first identified as a new variant in Japan, where it was found in travelers returning from Brazil.It has now been detected in more than 35 countries, though many have managed to limit infections.Several countries have suspended flights to and from Brazil over the outbreak, most recently France on Tuesday.Like the South Africa variant, P1 has a mutation known as E484K, dubbed an “escape mutation” because it helps the virus dodge our antibodies.The mutation alters the virus’ “spike protein,” helping it invade cells more easily.“It’s like a master key that can open various doors,” said Jesem Orellana, a researcher at Brazilian public health institute Fiocruz.P1 has thrived in part because of limited capacity to contain the virus, including in Manaus, whose health system collapsed so badly in January its hospitals ran out of oxygen.“If the Brazilian authorities had been responsible, they would have closed Manaus like China closed Wuhan,” Orellana told AFP.“Instead, they sent overflow patients to other regions, with people accompanying them, some of whom were also infected with P1” — accelerating the variant’s spread.Researchers have not definitively established whether P1 is more virulent.In preliminary studies, Orellana observed that the variant did not cause a significantly higher mortality rate among hospitalized patients in Manaus than during the first wave of the pandemic.He thinks Brazil’s soaring death toll is more likely caused by hospitals being overwhelmed.Other studies, however, indicate P1 is in fact more lethal.Experts say more research is also needed on the extent to which different vaccines are effective against P1.One piece of good news: preliminary studies show Chinese-developed CoronaVac, the most widely used Covid-19 vaccine in Brazil, as well as the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines, are at least partly effective against the variant — though definitive, real-world results are still needed.But there is bad news, too.The unchecked spread of the virus in Brazil has given rise to more mutations, including P2 — notably detected in Rio de Janeiro — and P4, recently identified in neighboring Minas Gerais state.“Brazil has become an open-air variant laboratory,” said Orellana.More may already be out there.“Brazil is one of the worst countries in the world on genetic sequencing. It’s no coincidence we discovered P1 some 60 days late — in Japan,” he said.Microbiologist Pasternak said in an ideal world, Brazil should combine a lockdown with mass vaccination.“Instead, we have neither,” she said.“We lack the political will for a lockdown, and the doses to vaccinate,” she said, criticizing a “lack of coordination” at the national level under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who has minimized the pandemic.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/russia-says-sputnik-v-vaccine-does-not-cause-blood-clots/,Russia says Sputnik V vaccine does not cause blood clots,1,"MOSCOW, Russia (AFP) — The developer of Russia’s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine said Wednesday its jab did not cause blood clots, a potential side effect that has disrupted rollouts in several Western countries.The United States has recommended pausing its rollout of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after one person out of nearly seven million Americans died from a rare type of clot in the brain following inoculation .Denmark on Wednesday became the first country in Europe to suspend use of the AstraZeneca jab after reports of rare but serious cases of blood clots among those that had received the vaccine.Like the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines, Russia’s Sputnik V jab uses adapted strains of the adenovirus that causes the common cold.On Wednesday, the state-run Gamaleya research institute, which developed Sputnik V vaccine, said there was no risk of blot clots from its jab.“A comprehensive analysis of adverse events during clinical trials and over the course of mass vaccinations with the Sputnik V vaccine showed that there were no cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis,” it said in a statement.Russia’s registration of Sputnik in August last year triggered criticism both at home and abroad over the fast-track procedure, but a leading medical journal said this year it was safe and highly effective.The vaccine has been registered for use in dozens of countries.The Gamaleya institute said it was “ready to share its purification technology with other vaccine producers in order to help them minimise the risk of adverse effects during vaccination.”President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday he had received the second dose of a vaccine against the coronavirus and encouraged Russians to follow his example.He has not said which of Russia’s three vaccines — EpicVacCorona and CoviVac in addition to Sputnik V — he received."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/open-the-windows-to-curb-covid-spread-experts/,Open the windows to curb Covid spread: experts,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Opening windows and ventilating spaces should be at the heart of efforts to prevent the spread of Covid-19, a group of experts said Thursday, arguing that confusion over airborne transmission meant this simple measure was being overlooked.Mounting evidence convinced many places to adopt mask-wearing recommendations and health authorities have for months said that crowded, badly ventilated indoor spaces are a particular risk.The virus is most likely to spread through inhalation at close range rather than through contact with surfaces or at long range, said respiratory experts said in a commentary published in the BMJ medical journal.But despite this, the role of aerosol transmission gets “only a cursory mention in some infection control guidelines”.“People are much more likely to become infected in a room with windows that can’t be opened or lacking any ventilation system,” they said.The authors, including Julian Tang from the University of Leicester and Linsey Marr from Virginia Tech, said part of the problem has been a lack of clarity in the definition of terms such as “droplet” and “airborne” when describing transmission.“Essentially, if you can inhale particles — regardless of their size or name — you are breathing in aerosols,” they said.“Although this can happen at long range, it is more likely when close to someone, as the aerosols between two people are much more concentrated at short range, rather like being close to someone who’s smoking.”At the beginning of the pandemic, health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO), discounted the possibility that simply breathing could send infectious micro-droplets into the air.But they did a U-turn as experts piled on pressure and evidence mounted.The BMJ commentary said precautions like wearing masks, keeping one’s distance and reducing crowding in indoor spaces would all help curb viral spread, whether it was through inhaled particles or direct contact with surfaces.But it stressed that a crucial difference was “the need for added emphasis on ventilation because the tiniest suspended particles can remain airborne for hours, and these constitute an important route of transmission”.In March, the WHO released a guidance document encouraging better ventilation in buildings.It said that while “knowledge gaps” remain, transmission of the virus that causes Covid-19 is particularly effective in crowded, confined indoor spaces where there is poor or no ventilation."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/drug-resistant-malaria-gaining-foothold-in-africa-study/,Drug-resistant malaria gaining foothold in Africa: study,1,"Researchers on Thursday reported the first clinical evidence that drug-resistant mutations of the parasite responsible for malaria are gaining ground in Africa.Experts have long worried about the emergence of drug resistance across the continent, which accounted for more than 90 percent of malaria deaths worldwide in 2019.A new study published in The Lancet appears to confirm those fears.In clinical trials, the disease lingered longer in children receiving standard treatment for malaria if they were infected with mutant strains of the disease, the study found.The efficacy of Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) remained high, but the researchers said there was an “urgent need” for more monitoring in Rwanda, where the study was conducted, as well as in neighbouring countries.There are an estimated 229 million cases of malaria worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).The disease killed more than 400,000 people in 2019, more than two-thirds of them children.Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, which is carried by females mosquitos from any of several dozen species in the genus Anopheles.“Our study shows that resistant isolates are starting to become more common,” said lead author Aline Uwimana, a researcher at the Rwanda Biomedical Centre in Kigali.Introduced in the early 2000s, ACTs are the most effective and widely used treatments for malaria.The medication combines an artemisinin component that clears most of the pathogens from the patient’s body within three days, and a long-acting partner drug that gets rid of the remaining parasites. Resistance to the artemisinin component is suspected if P. falciparum is still present after Day Three of treatment.Currently, ten mutations in one of the parasite’s genes, known as pfk13, have been confirmed as markers of partial resistance, and several others are tagged as potential markers.Partial artemisinin resistance was first identified in Cambodia in 2008, and is today well-documented in many Southeast Asian countries.Evidence from the Mekong region has shown that once artemisinin resistance becomes prevalent, resistance to the partner drug often follows, resulting in ACT treatment failure.In 2006, Rwanda introduced the most widely used antimalarial as the first-line treatment for the disease.A study in 2013 and 2014 showed some mutations, but no evidence that the drug combo was less effective.Follow-up research in 2018, however, showed for the first time mutations in the pfk13 gene and so-called delayed parasite clearance in patients, though ACT effectiveness remained above the critical threshold of 90 percent.In the trial, more than 200 children six months to five years old infected by the parasite received three-day standard treatment, and were then monitored for 28 days.About 15 percent had detectable parasites three days post treatment.“Recent data suggest that we are on the verge of clinically meaningful artemisinin resistance in Africa,” Philip Rosenthal, a professor at the University of California in San Francisco, wrote in a comment, also in The Lancet.Loss of efficacy of key ACTs “may have dire consequences, as occurred when chloroquine resistance led to enormous increases in malaria deaths in the late twentieth century,” he said."

The results of these studies have been posted online in a scientific paper that is now awaiting peer review.“The new preclinical data on our variant-specific vaccine candidates give us confidence that we can proactively address emerging variants,” said CEO Stephane Bancel.The company said that as of April 12, it has delivered 132 million doses of its vaccine globally, including approximately 117 million doses to the United States.It remains on course to deliver its second tranche of 100 million doses by the end of May followed by 100 million more by the end of July.The company’s clinical trial for adolescents aged 12 to 17 is now fully enrolled with 3,000 US participants, and its pediatric trial for children aged six months to 11 years is continuing to enroll its 6,750 participants in the United States and China.© Agence France-Presse"

South Africa followed the United States’ lead and suspended its rollout of the J&J shot, delaying an already sluggish campaign, which has so far only administered this vaccine.But the European Medicines Agency said it was continuing to carry out its own investigation, and Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters his country still expected its first shipment of the shot by the end of the month.More than 800 million vaccine doses have now been administered globally, according to an AFP tally.India — which is experiencing a record surge in cases — was given a boost as it authorized Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 drug.The total number of virus deaths is approaching three million, as the World Health Organization warned infections are rising exponentially despite efforts aimed at stopping them. In India health officials have been battling a huge surge in cases in recent weeks that has prompted night curfews and a clampdown on movement and activities.The country of 1.3 billion people on Monday reported more than 161,000 new cases — the seventh-consecutive day that more than 100,000 infections have been recorded.Experts have warned that huge, mostly maskless crowds at political rallies and religious festivals have fueled India’s caseload, and in the Himalayan city Haridwar, maskless Hindu pilgrims have ignored social distancing pleas.In Europe, Germany agreed to controversial changes to a national infections control law, including a night curfew and stricter rules around private gatherings and sports.France has suspended all flights from Brazil to curb the spread of a new variant found there.But Britain said it had met its target to offer a first vaccine dose to all over-50s, the clinically vulnerable and health and social workers by April 15.Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, said the world was now at a “critical point” of the pandemic as cases once again grow exponentially.The organization also called for a halt to the sale of live wild mammals in food markets to prevent the emergence of new diseases such as coronavirus."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-patients-with-sedentary-habits-more-likely-to-die-study/,Covid patients with sedentary habits more likely to die: study,1,"Among covid patients, a lack of exercise is linked to more severe symptoms and a higher risk of death, according to a study covering nearly 50,000 people who were infected with the virus.People physically inactive for at least two years before the pandemic were more likely to be hospitalised, to require intensive care, and to die, researchers reported Tuesday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.As a risk factor for serious Covid disease, physical inactivity was surpassed only by advanced age and a history of organ transplant, the study found.Indeed, compared to other modifiable risk factors such as smoking, obesity or hypertension, “physical inactivity was the strongest risk factor across all outcomes,” the authors concluded.The pre-existing conditions most associated with severe Covid-19 infection are advanced age, being male, and having diabetes, obesity or cardiovascular disease.But up to now, a sedentary lifestyle has not been included.To see whether a lack of exercise increases the odds of severe infection, hospitalisation, admission into an intensive care unit (ICU), and death, the researchers compared these outcomes in 48,440 adults in the United States infected with Covid-19 between January and October 2020.The average age of patients was 47, and three out of five were women. On average, their mass-body index was 31, just above the threshold for obesity. Around half had no underlying illnesses, such as diabetes, chronic lung conditions, heart or kidney disease, or cancer. Nearly 20 percent had one, and more than 30 percent had two or more.All of the patients had reported their level of regular physical activity at least three times between March 2018 and March 2020 at outpatient clinics.Some 15 percent described themselves as inactive (0–10 minutes of physical activity per week), nearly 80 percent reported “some activity” (11–149 minutes/week), and seven percent were consistently active in keeping with national health guidelines (150+ minutes/week).After allowing for differences due to race, age and underlying medical conditions, sedentary Covid-19 patients were more than twice as likely to be admitted to hospital as those who were most active.They were also 73 percent more likely to require intensive care, and 2.5 times more likely to die due to the infection.Compared to patients in the habit of doing occasional physical activity, couch potatoes were 20 percent more likely to be admitted to hospital, 10 percent more likely to require intensive care, and 32 percent more likely to die.While the link is statistically strong, the study — which is observational, as opposed to a clinical trial — cannot be construed as direct evidence that a lack of exercise directly caused the difference in outcomes.The findings also depend on self-reporting by patients, with a potential for bias."

Patients with the variant tended to be younger, and infections of B117 occurred more frequently in ethnic minority groups, the data showed.The authors also analysed the transmissibility by looking at data generated by PCR testing. They found that samples of B117 tended to contain greater quantities of the virus than non-B117 swabs.Commenting on the first study, Sean Wei Xiang Ong, Barnaby Edward Young and David Chien Lye from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore, said that the findings were in contrast to three previous studies suggesting that B117 was deadlier than other variants.However they said the Lancet study had the benefit of having used whole-genome sequencing as well as a good variety of patient and disease outcomes.“The finding that lineage B117 infection did not confer increased risk of severe disease and mortality in this high-risk cohort is reassuring but requires further confirmation in larger studies,” said the experts, who were not involved in the research.A second study analysed self-reported data from 36,920 British users of a Covid-19 symptom app who tested positive between September 28 and December 27 last year.They found that the B117 variant had a reproduction rate 1.35 times higher than normal coronavirus variants, but also found no evidence of increased disease severity."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/s-african-covid-variant-better-at-bypassing-pfizer-biontech-jab-israeli-study/,S. African Covid variant better at bypassing Pfizer/BioNTech jab: Israeli study,1,"JERUSALEM (AFP) — The South African coronavirus variant is better at “breaking through” the defences of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine than other forms of the virus, Israeli experts said Sunday.However, one of the authors told AFP that while the study showed the variant to be relatively successful in infecting vaccinated people, it did not provide any data on whether it could generate serious illness among vaccinees.The study by Tel Aviv University and Clalit Health Services, Israel’s largest healthcare provider, compared 400 unvaccinated people infected with Covid-19 to 400 partially or fully vaccinated people who also had the virus.According to the study, published as a draft on Saturday and currently being peer reviewed, the South African variant accounted for less than one percent of coronavirus cases in Israel.But, among the 150 people in the study who were fully vaccinated and had Covid-19, “the prevalence rate (of the South African variant) was eight times higher than the rate in the unvaccinated (individuals),” the study said.“This means that the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, though highly protective, probably does not provide the same level of protection against the South African (B.1.351) variant of the coronavirus,” the study added.“The South African variant is able, to some extent, to break through the vaccine’s protection,” said professor Adi Stern of Tel Aviv University’s Shmunis School of Biomedicine and Cancer Research, one of the study’s authors.Stern told AFP Sunday the study did not assess whether the fully vaccinated Israelis with the South African variant — eight people in total — developed serious illness.“Since we found a very small number of vaccinees infected with B.1.351, it is statistically meaningless to report disease outcomes,” he said. Two studies published in February in the New England Journal of Medicine conducted by principal vaccine manufacturers Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna showed that the presence of antibodies after vaccination was less pronounced in people exposed to the South African variant, indicating diminished protection.The Israeli study was the first real-world assessment of the South African variant’s ability to bypass a vaccine.Israel’s vaccination campaign has seen 5.3 million people receive a first dose, while 4.9 million, or 53 percent of the population, have had two shots.An earlier study by Clalit on 1.2 million Israelis found that the Pfizer/BioNTech jab gave 94 percent protection against Covid-19.Following the successful vaccination rollout, Israel has eased many of its restrictions but various measures remain in place including mask-wearing and a “green passport” system that grants access to certain sites only to those vaccinated.Ran Balicer of Clalit, one of the study’s authors, told AFP the results could help inform states on how best to ease restrictions.Balicer said inoculations, plus mask-wearing and other safety measures had still likely helped limit the spread of the South African variant, despite its apparent ability to break through the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.A combination of all these factors “are most likely… preventing the virus strains, including the South African one, from spreading” significantly in Israel, he said.“As we taper down the non-pharmaceutical interventions, we must do so gradually to ensure we do not cross a threshold that would enable these variants to spread.”© Agence France-Presse"

The AstraZeneca jabs produced in South Korea and India, plus the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and that of Johnson and Johnson, are the only ones to have received WHO authorisation so far in the Covid-19 pandemic.The AstraZeneca vaccine accounts for almost all of the doses being distributed around the world in the first wave of the Covax global vaccine-sharing facility.Covax has now delivered 36 million doses of coronavirus vaccine to 86 countries and economies, the WHO said Tuesday.The scheme aims to ensure poorer nations get enough doses to vaccinate at least 20 percent of their population by the end of the year.Overall, more than 694 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been injected in at least 195 territories around the world, according to an AFP count.The novel coronavirus has killed nearly 2.9 million people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. At least 132 million cases have been registered."

We believe that we’ll be in a position to do much more on this front,” Blinken said.“By helping bring to a close one of the deadliest pandemics in human history, we can show the world once again what American leadership and American ingenuity can do.”Acknowledging “growing desperation” in parts of the world, Blinken said: “I promise we’re moving as fast as possible.”Blinken named Gayle Smith, who headed the US Agency for International Development under former president Barack Obama, to a new position of US coordinator for global Covid response and health security. Smith most recently headed ONE, a campaign backed by pop star Bono to fight extreme poverty.In a veiled criticism of China and Russia, which have assertively promoted their vaccines, Blinken said the Biden administration would follow “core values” on Covid relief and seek not to worsen inequities.“We won’t trade shots in arms for political favors. This is about saving lives,” Blinken said.“We’ll treat our partner countries with respect. We won’t overpromise and under-deliver,” he said, vowing only to distribute vaccines “proven to be safe and effective.”The United States last month announced a joint initiative with India, Japan and Australia to produce more than one billion more Covid doses by the end of next year, with a focus on administering them in Southeast Asia."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/russia-registers-worlds-first-covid-vaccine-for-animals/,puts envoy in charge,1,"MOSCOW, Russia (AFP) — Russia announced Wednesday it had registered what it said was the world’s first coronavirus vaccine for animals, describing the step as important for disrupting virus mutations.It said mass production of the vaccine could begin in April.The agriculture oversight agency Rosselkhoznadzor said in a statement that the vaccine called Carnivak-Cov had been tested since October on dogs, cats, mink, foxes and other animals and was proven to be effective.“All test animals that were vaccinated developed antibodies to coronavirus in 100 percent of cases,” said Konstantin Savenkov, deputy head of Rosselkhoznadzor.“It is the world’s first and only product for preventing Covid-19 in animals.”Rosselkhoznadzor said the development of its shot would help prevent mutations in animals and cited Denmark’s decision to cull 15 million mink last year after some were found to be carrying a mutated virus variant.“The use of the vaccine, according to Russian scientists, can prevent the development of virus mutations,” the statement said.The agency added that animal-breeding facilities and private companies from countries including Greece, Poland, Austria, the United States, Canada and Singapore had expressed interest in Carnivak-Cov.Military officials in Russia’s second city Saint Petersburg announced this week that army dogs would undergo mandatory vaccination before being deployed at airports and participating in nationwide World War II commemorations in May. Veterinarians and fur breeders said on Wednesday they saw no immediate need to vaccinate animals.A veterinary clinic in Moscow said it was looking into the information but currently it saw no reason to vaccinate cats and dogs.“It has not been proven that they are Covid-19 carriers,” the clinic said in a statement to AFP.Russian fur breeders have so far not encountered any cases of coronavirus in animals and are not planning to vaccinate them, said the head of the National Association of Fur Breeders, Nadezhda Zubkova.But some of the animals have been vaccinated during trials and “are feeling fine”, Zubkova told AFP.“It is a decent vaccine,” said Zubkova whose association comprises farms with around 2 million animals including minks and foxes.Russia has heavily promoted its state-sponsored coronavirus vaccine abroad but it has been met with scepticism in the West and even by many in Russia.Officials registered the Sputnik V vaccine last August, ahead of large-scale clinical trials, sparking concern among many experts over the fast-track process. It has since registered two more vaccines.Leading medical journal The Lancet in February confirmed Sputnik V to be safe and over 90 percent effective.Moscow has applied to Europe’s medicines regulator to gain approval for the use of Sputnik V in the 27-nation bloc, but is still waiting for an answer."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-experts-give-nod-to-china-jabs-sinovac-and-sinopharm-boosting-global-vaccine-drive/,Russia registers ‘world’s first’ Covid vaccine for animals,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — Two Chinese coronavirus jabs are safe and effective, WHO experts said Wednesday after reviewing partial data, providing a potential boost to countries from Australia to Europe struggling to roll out vaccines fast enough.Fewer than 600 million jabs have been given out across the world, three months after vaccination programmes began in earnest in Western countries and leaders hailed the drugs as the only safe way out of punishing lockdowns.Vaccine specialists at the World Health Organization did not issue any advice on how to use China’s jabs, saying they would wait until a decision had been taken on whether to grant them emergency licences.The experts said the vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm “lacked data” for older age groups and people with medical conditions other than Covid. Another vaccine maker, Pfizer-BionTech, was pushing ahead with its plans to ramp up production and rollout — saying on Wednesday new data from the US showed its jab was 100 percent effective on 12 to 15-year-olds.The firm said it wanted to start vaccinating youngsters in the US before the start of the next school year.The US has already rolled out almost 150 million vaccines doses, far more than any other country. But it has also suffered more than 550,000 deaths, the highest death toll in the world.Globally, the virus has killed more than 2.8 million people since it emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. Large parts of Europe are battling high infection rates, with most of the continent still living under lockdowns or other restrictions.French President Emmanuel Macron, who has repeatedly vowed not to reintroduce a national lockdown, is under increasing pressure.He is expected to announce tougher measures — possibly including school closures — later Wednesday.In Paris, intensive care beds are running low and infection rates are approaching last year’s peak, pushing medics to breaking point.“Since January, we have had political decisions with no scientific coherence,” said Gilles Pialoux, head of infectious diseases at one Paris hospital.“We’ve lost so much time that the measures now will be harder and last for longer.”The cycle of restrictions and infections is not over in China either, where a city on the Myanmar border faces lockdown — the first such move in months.All residents in the city of Ruili will be tested for the virus and everyone will have to observe “home quarantine” for a week after six cases were detected, say officials. Australia, largely free of Covid infections, still faces a huge challenge to get jabs into arms, especially since some countries have started blocking exports to what they regard as a low-risk region.So far, just 670,000 doses have been administered, well below initial plans to vaccinate four million people by the end of March.“It’s not a race,” said Prime Minister Scott Morrison, accusing critics of “wanting to play politics with vaccine and distribution”.Even further behind is war-torn Yemen, which accepted its first delivery of jabs on Wednesday.Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it had seen a “dramatic influx” of critically ill Covid-19 patients in Aden and other parts of Yemen.With the rest of the world scrambling to catch up with the US, the positive signals from the WHO on the Chinese jabs could be crucial.However, WHO experts pointed out that neither had yet received authorisation by what the UN agency considered “a stringent regulatory authority”. The EU’s drug regulating agency said Wednesday it had found no specific risk factors connecting the AstraZeneca vaccine to reports of blood clotting.But the European Medicines Agency added: “A causal link with the vaccine is not proven, but is possible and further analysis is continuing.”Some EU countries have restricted access to the vaccine over reports of blood clotting.The Covid crisis has pushed health systems to the brink, brought huge challenges for policymakers and devastated the global economy.But Britain released economic data suggesting it had bounced back stronger than expected in the second half of last year. Overall output expanded by 16.9 percent in the third quarter, stronger than the 16.1 percent predicted.Longer-term prospects for women in the world economy look gloomier however, according to the World Economic Forum.While the forum’s 2019 Global Gender Gap Report had suggested gender parity would be reached in many sectors in less than a century, this year’s report pushes it back to 135.6 years.“There has been sort of a rollback to traditional behaviours inside the home, and that then creates a double shift for women who are working,” said WEF’s Saadia Zahidi."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/global-leaders-push-for-pandemic-preparedness-treaty/,WHO experts give nod to China jabs,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — World leaders pushed Tuesday for a new international treaty to prepare for the next global pandemic — and avoid the unseemly scramble for vaccines hampering the Covid-19 response.Leaders from 25 countries, the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO) sought to get the ground rules down in writing to streamline and speed up the reaction to future global outbreaks.The treaty would aim to ensure that information, virus pathogens, technology to tackle the pandemic and products such as vaccines are shared swiftly and equitably among nations.“The time to act is now. The world cannot afford to wait until the pandemic is over to start planning for the next one,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual press conference.Without an internationally-coordinated pandemic response plan, “we remain vulnerable”, he warned.The call came in a joint article published in international newspapers on Tuesday, penned by leaders from five continents.The signatories included Germany’s Angela Merkel, Britain’s Boris Johnson, France’s Emmanuel Macron, South Korea’s Moon Jae-in, South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa, Indonesia’s Joko Widodo and Chile’s Sebastian Pinera.– “Nations should work together towards a new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response,” the article said.“We must be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess and effectively respond to pandemics in a highly coordinated fashion.“We are, therefore, committed to ensuring universal and equitable access to safe, efficacious and affordable vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for this and future pandemics.”Leaders from key world powers including the United States, China, Russia and Japan are not among the signatories so far.But Tedros said the mood music from Washington and Beijing was positive and insisted it was not a problem that they had not yet signed up.Tedros hoped to have a resolution squared up in time for the World Health Assembly in May. The assembly is the WHO’s decision-making body, attended once a year by delegations from the UN health agency’s 194 member states.The push to bolster common efforts comes as the planet struggles to combine forces to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic that has killed almost 2.8 million people worldwide and battered the global economy.The spread of the virus has seen blame traded between capitals and accusations that rich nations have hoarded vaccines.According to an AFP count, some 53 percent of the Covid-19 vaccine doses administered so far have been in high-income countries accounting for 16 percent of the global population.Just 0.1 percent have been administered in the 29 lowest-income countries, home to nine percent of the world’s population. The WHO said that while the existing 2005 International Health Regulations covered first alerts, travel measures and sharing information on how to break an epidemic, the Covid-19 pandemic had exposed gaps such as supply chains, research and development.The joint article said the additional treaty should be aimed at “greatly enhancing international cooperation” on alert systems, data-sharing and reasearch to help track rising threats and the production of vaccines, medicines and protective equipment to tackle diseases.First proposed by European Council president Charles Michel at the United Nations in December, the notion of a treaty has since been endorsed by EU and G7 countries.“Now it’s time to come together as one global community to build a pandemic defence for future generations that extends far beyond today’s crisis,” EU chief Michel told the joint press conference with Tedros.The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations lobby group said the importance of incentives to develop tests, treatments and vaccines should be reflected in the treaty.“The biopharmaceutical industry and its supply chain is part of the solution for future pandemics and therefore should play a role in shaping an international pandemic treaty,” IFPMA chief Thomas Cueni said in a statement. © Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/why-experts-think-well-need-to-vaccinate-children-against-covid/,Sinovac and Sinopharm,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Drugmaker Moderna says it has started Covid-19 vaccine trials for thousands of children aged under 12, a first step towards a new phase of the immunization campaign experts say might be necessary to stamp out the pandemic.While children are generally spared the worst of the disease, under-18s account for roughly a fifth of the US population of 330 million, and millions have so far been infected.“If we really want to get towards herd immunity, that’s going to require as much as 80 percent of our population to be vaccinated, and we really can’t do that without vaccinating children,” Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) told AFP.Moderna’s two-dose regimen is currently authorized for use in adults, and the company is already in the middle of an adolescent study which is expected to be completed by June.The new trial is expected to enrol 6,750 participants aged six months to 12 years.Pfizer’s vaccine is already authorized for over 16s and the company is pursuing an adolescent study, as is Johnson & Johnson, while AstraZeneca is studying its vaccine in children over six. The benefits of vaccinating children are direct, in terms of preventing rare serious pediatric Covid-19 and the mysterious postinfectious condition “multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children” (MIS-C), but also indirect in terms of limiting spread.“There’s going to be a different risk-benefit calculation when you’re vaccinating a nine-year-old versus a 90-year-old,” Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told AFP.“What level of side effects are tolerable, and are the current generation of vaccines the best one to use as pediatric vaccines?” he continued, adding that vaccines under development might cause fewer or less intense adverse reactions than those currently authorized.Adalja added that he saw a more immediate role for vaccines in high-school age children who more closely resemble adults in the way they can spread the disease.According to the latest official data, 294 people under the age of 18 have died from Covid-19 in the United States, a tiny fraction of the overall figure of 535,000.The preponderance of research has also shown younger children, particularly those under 10, are also less likely to become infected and thus spread the virus onwardsBut in both cases, “less likely” does not mean “impossible.”“Millions of children have been infected with the virus and the more children that are infected, the more children will potentially have complications,” Henry Bernstein, a professor of pediatrics at the Zucker School of Medicine and Cohen Children’s Medical Center told AFP.“We know that Covid is already disrupting their education, we know that it’s causing physical health issues as well as mental health issues and emotionally it’s problematic as well.”While Bernstein favors vaccinating children, he added it was imperative the shots were well studied because “kids are not little adults” and differ in important physiological respects.“They really deserve to have studies that show these vaccines are safe and effective.” At present, five US states or territories have partial school closure orders in effect, seven are ordering them open, while the rest are operating on a mixed basis, according to data collected by Education Week.None of the experts polled believed vaccinations should be considered a prerequisite for schools to reopen for in-person learning, but should be seen instead as one measure among many.“Like with other kinds of preventative measures that we’ve been recommending: physical distancing, hand washing, and masking, vaccination is another tool in our toolbox to help prevent transmission,” said Nipunie Rajapakse, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Mayo Clinic.Given that children are generally less susceptible to Covid, some have suggested prioritizing individuals with risk factors.“But in some cases it can be difficult to predict exactly which child is at risk for developing severe infections,” said Rajapakse.That’s particularly true for MIS-C, the most feared pediatric complication, which occurs weeks after infection and causes inflammation in different parts of the body.The US has seen just over 2,600 cases and 33 deaths to date from this condition."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-19-vaccines-online-or-in-development/,Covid-19 vaccines online or in development,1,"With several Covid-19 vaccines either being rolled out or under trial, here is a rundown of the various stages of their development.PFIZER/BIONTECHThe mRNA vaccine developed by US pharma giant Pfizer and German start-up BioNTech is already approved for use in the European Union, the United States, Canada, Britain and several other nations.Clinical trials showed the vaccine — which delivers instructions to the body to help the immune system identify and destroy Covid-19 molecules — to be 95 percent effective in preventing illness and hospitalisation.In the real world, it has proven even more successful, the drugmaker said Thursday, reporting 97 percent effectiveness in blocking serious forms of Covid-19 in Israel, where more than half the population has been fully vaccinated.MODERNAThe US-made mRNA vaccine, with a 94.1-percent efficacy rate, has been approved for use in the EU, North America, Britain, and several other nations, including Israel and Singapore.ASTRAZENECA/OXFORDThis more classic viral vector vaccine — developed by the University of Oxford and Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca — is authorised for use in the EU, Britain and India, where it is marketed under the name “Covishield”.It was shown to be 60 percent effective in trials, but has proven to have a much higher success rate in those countries where it has been widely used.It is also far cheaper, as well as easier to stock and transport than mRNA vaccines.But the vaccine has been plagued by problems — stemming from poor communications, inaccurate reporting and ostensible links with side-effects — since before its roll out even began.Most recently, its use has been suspended by national health authorities in Denmark, Iceland and Norway following reports of a possible link with blood clots.The European Medicines Agency (EMA), however, said on Thursday that “there is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions”.JOHNSON & JOHNSONAnother viral vector vaccine, the Johnson & Johnson jab became on Thursday the fourth to be authorised in the European Union. It has also been greenlighted in the United States, Canada and South Africa, which began administering it as early as mid-February.The vaccine showed an overall efficacy of 66 percent in clinical trials, and of 85 percent against serious illness.SPUTNIK VRussia’s vaccine works in a similar way to the AstraZeneca/Oxford jab, but has a 91.6-percent efficacy according to trial results.More than a dozen nations have authorised its use, including Belarus, Armenia, Iran, Algeria, Argentina, South Korea and Venezuela.Its makers have begun the process of asking for approval from the EMA. Hungary, Slovakia and Czech Republic are the only EU member states to have started administering doses.SINOPHARMTwo vaccines developed in China use the traditional technique of injecting the deactivated virus in order to trigger an immune response.Along with the United Arab Emirates, Hungary, Cambodia, Peru and Zimbabwe have all started administering the vaccine, which its makers say is 79 percent effective.SINOVACThe other Chinese-developed vaccine uses a similar technique and is authorised in China, Chile, Brazil and Turkey.Others nations, including Ukraine and Uruguay, have pre-ordered doses.The makers say it is 50 percent effective overall against Covid-19 (and 80 percent effective against severe illness), but trial results have not yet been made public.BHARAT BIOTECHThis inactivated virus vaccine is used currently in India.CANSINOA Chinese-made viral vector vaccine was authorised for use in Mexico last week, but has not yet been administered to the public. NOVAVAXThis American vaccine is under rolling review by the EMA, which has the ultimate say on EU medical authorisations.It is based on “sub-unit” proteins that trigger an immune response without delivering the whole virus. The makers say it is 89.3 percent effective.CUREVACThe German vaccine entered EMA review last week. It uses similar technology to the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech jabs. The World Health Organization says there are currently 69 vaccines against the novel coronavirus in human trials.An additional 180 candidate vaccines are under development, but have yet to begin testing on humans. Several studies have shown that vaccines in use are no less effective against the so-called English variant, which is both more contagious and more lethal.But variants that emerged in Brazil and South Africa that share one or more key mutations may be able to evade vaccines more easily.Which is not to say that they don’t work at all, experts say.VIDEven if, for example, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a little less effective against the South African variant overall, it seems to protect against severe illness as well as it does for the original variant it was designed to block, according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).In any event, manufacturers are already working on modified vaccines against the new variants and others that might come into being.On Wednesday, Moderna announced it was starting clinical trials to test a modified vaccine against the South African variant."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/drinking-alcohol-substance-use-linked-to-severe-covid-19-hospitalization-and-death-various-studies-show/,Drinking alcohol,1,"(Eagle News) – Persons who have a history of alcohol, illegal drugs and substance use are more at risk in getting severe COVID-19 and being hospitalized, according to various studies and the World Health Organization.In fact, WHO is urging all countries to restrict alcohol or liquor use during lockdown as this had been found to contribute to severe COVID-19 infection, and even deaths.The organization also issued a fact sheet on alcohol use amid misinformation being circulated about drinking alcohol to fight COVID-19.“Fear and misinformation have generated a dangerous myth that consuming high-strength alcohol can kill the COVID-19 virus. It does not. Consuming any alcohol poses health risks, but consuming high-strength ethyl alcohol (ethanol), particularly if it has been adulterated with methanol, can result in severe health consequences, including death,” the WHO Regional Office for Europe said in a previous statement.“In no way will consumption of alcohol protect you from COVID-19 or prevent you from being infected by it,” WHO noted in a WHO reminds the public that they can use alcohol to disinfect their hands or even their surroundings to kill the virus, but that drinking alcohol won’t kill the virus. In fact, drinking alcohol can lead to COVID-19 deaths as it weakens the immune system and makes one prone to severe infections and complications.A study on alcohol and substance use and its relation to the risk of hospitalization, complications and mortality among adult patients diagnosed as having COVID-19 also showed this direct correlation.The study done by Jacques Baillargeon, Ph.D., Efstathaia Polychronopoulou, M.S., M.P.H., Yong-Fang Kuo, Ph.D., Mukaila A. Raji, M.D. concluded that “COVID-19 patients with substance use disorders are at increased risk for adverse outcomes.”The researchers studied adult patients with COVID-19 for four months, from Feb. 20 to June 30, 2020, and found that “substance use disorder were associated with increased hospitalization, ventilator use, and mortality.”They said that “given the virus’s impact on the respiratory, cardio vascular, and immune systems—which can be impaired by opioids, tobacco, and abuse of other substances—persons with substance use disorders are at increased risk of COVID-19 complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and death.”“There is ample evidence that opioids, alcohol, methamphetamines, smoking, and vaping all have strong immunosuppressive effects, resulting in greater susceptibility to infection, more severe and longer lasting ill nesses, and lower levels of protective antibodies in the blood,” the study said.Results of the experts’ study were conclusive.“Three outcomes—hospitalization, ventilator use, and mortality—within 21 days of COVID-19 diagnosis were examined in the substance use disorder versus non–substance use disorder cohorts,” their study showed.Simply put, “having a substance use disorder was associated with increased hospitalization, ventilator use, and mortality.”The study involved 11,124 adults diagnosed with COVID-19 from 35 health systems covering all major regions of the United States.Another study involving a larger population in the U.S. also showed this correlation. The study published in the studied around 73 million unique patients, including 7,510,380 patients with a diagnosis of Substance Use Disorder (SUD). Around 12,000 of these patients had been diagnosed with COVID-19.“Patients with a recent diagnosis of SUD were at significantly increased risk for COVID-19, an effect that was strongest for individuals with OUD (opioid use disorder), followed by individuals with tobacco use disorder (TUD),” it said citing analysis of electronic health records of the patients across the US as of June 15 last year.The study was conducted by doctors QuanQiu Wang, Rong Xu (both at Case Western Reserve University), David C Kaelber (The MetroHealth System, Cleveland, OH), and Nora Volkow. The study was first published in Sept. 2020.WHO stressed the importance of making people understand that drinking alcohol would create greater risk for more people to get severe COVID-19 infection.“During the COVID-19 pandemic, we should really ask ourselves what risks we are taking in leaving people under lockdown in their homes with a substance that is harmful both in terms of their health and the effects of their behaviour on others, including violence,” said Carina Ferreira-Borges, Programme Manager, Alcohol and Illicit Drugs Programme, WHO/Europe.The WHO regional office in Europe noted this.“Existing rules and regulations to protect health and reduce harm caused by alcohol, such as restricting access, should be upheld and even reinforced during the COVID-19 pandemic and emergency situations; while any relaxation of regulations or their enforcement should be avoided,” it said in a previous advisory.This needs to be complemented by communicating with the public about the risks of alcohol consumption, and maintaining and strengthening alcohol and drug services,” it added.Aside from weakening the body’s immune system, drinking alcohol can affect decision-making and behavior, and even lead to interpersonal violence, WHO said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/astrazeneca-says-vaccine-80-effective-for-elderly-no-blood-clot-risk/,substance use linked to severe COVID-19,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine is 80 percent effective at preventing the disease in the elderly and does not increase the risk of blood clots, the biotech firm said Monday, following its US phase III efficiency trials.It was 79 percent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in the overall population and 100 percent effective at preventing severe disease and hospitalization, it said.Several countries had advised against administering the jab to older people due to a lack of data among elderly participants in previous trials. Earlier this month several countries also paused use of the AstraZeneca shot over fears it may cause blood clots.The US phase III trial of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University involved 32,449 participants, with two thirds receiving the jab, the pharmaceutical firm said in a statement.Around 20 percent were 65 or older, and about 60 percent had health conditions associated with a higher risk of severe Covid-19, such as diabetes, severe obesity or cardiac disease.“These findings reconfirm previous results observed in AZD1222 trials across all adult populations but it’s exciting to see similar efficacy results in people over 65 for the first time,” said Ann Falsey, professor of medicine at University of Rochester School of Medicine and co-lead principal investigator for the trial.“This analysis validates the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine as a much-needed additional vaccination option, offering confidence that adults of all ages can benefit from protection against the virus.”The trial’s independent data safety monitoring board found no increased risk of thrombosis among the 21,583 participants who received at least one dose, the statement said.Some leading EU countries have resumed AstraZeneca vaccinations after the European Medicines Agency said Thursday the jab was “safe and effective” and was not linked to an increased risk of blood clots.AstraZeneca said it was preparing to submit its findings to the US Food and Drug Administration to authorize the shot for emergency use.“These results add to the growing body of evidence that shows this vaccine is well tolerated and highly effective against all severities of Covid-19 and across all age groups,” said Mene Pangalos, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D.“We are confident this vaccine can play an important role in protecting millions of people worldwide against this lethal virus.”The results also suggested that administering the second shot more than four weeks after the first could further increase efficacy.Previous trials have shown leaving up to 12 weeks between jabs increased its efficacy."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/jj-jab-effective-in-countries-with-variants-who-experts/,hospitalization and death,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The WHO’s expert vaccine advisers on Wednesday recommended Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 jab for use in countries where coronavirus variants of concern are circulating.The World Health Organization gave its seal of approval on Friday to the vaccine, which has the advantages of being a single-shot jab that can be stored at regular refrigeration rather than ultra-cold temperatures.After meeting on Monday, the WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization issued its recommendations Wednesday on how the vaccine should be used — and said it had proven effective against what are termed variants of concern.Comparing mass trials of the vaccine in different countries, SAGE said that despite the South African variant being predominant in that country, “similar efficacies were observed as in the US”, it said, “where newly-emerging variants of concern were not predominant” during testing.The same was true in Brazil, which has had its own predominant variant in circulation.“We have a vaccine that shows to be safe and it shows to have the necessary efficacy to be recommended by us for use in people above the age of 18, without an upper age limit,” SAGE chair Alejandro Cravioto told reporters.“In the countries where there is a high spread of the variants and in countries where we now have information about the use of this vaccine to control SARS-CoV-2 caused by these variants, we recommend that you use it.”SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes Covid-19 disease. Across the board, a single dose of the vaccine has 66.9 percent efficacy against symptomatic infection; 76.7 percent efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease after 14 days; and 85.4 percent efficacy after day 28, SAGE said.“Vaccine efficacy against hospitalisations was 93.1 percent. Vaccine efficacies were maintained across genders, age and ethnicities,” the experts said.SAGE said that as with other Covid-19 jabs, it should be injected under health care supervision, with medical treatment on hand in case of allergic reactions.People should wait at least 14 days before receiving any other vaccine.As for pregnant women, there was insufficient data to assess vaccine-associated risks, though breastfeeding women should be offered the jab as normal.People who have already had Covid-19 should be offered the vaccine, but may opt to wait until up to six months after infection, because they will already have a degree of natural protection.However, in areas with variants of concern, they should not step back in the queue as “emerging data indicate that symptomatic reinfection may occur”.“The optimal interval between a natural infection and vaccination is not yet known,” said SAGE. The J&J vaccine is the only single-shot jab to have been granted WHO authorisation.Annelies Wilder-Smith, technical advisor to the SAGE secretariat, told reporters the jab was a “welcome additional weapon” rather than a game-changer in the fight against Covid-19.It joins the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech jab and the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines made in India and in South Korea as having been signed off by the WHO.The J&J jab won approval from the European Union on Thursday. It has also received the green light from regulators in the United States, Canada and South Africa.The jab is one of the main vaccines being lined up for distribution to poorer countries around the world via the Covax global vaccine-sharing scheme.Some 500 million J&J doses have been promised to the facility and the WHO hopes it can be rolled out through the programme from July, if not earlier.© Agence France-Presse"

It also shows that the surveillance system works and that effective controls are in place,” it said.“Vaccination against Covid-19 will not reduce illness or deaths from other causes.“Thromboembolic events are known to occur frequently. Venous thromboembolism is the third most common cardiovascular disease globally.”The WHO said it was in regular contact with the EU’s European Medicines Agency and regulators around the world for the latest information on Covid-19 vaccine safety."

On Friday, Bulgaria suspends the use of the vaccine as it investigates the death of a woman with several underlying conditions who recently received the jab.An initial probe had suggested the woman died from heart failure and an autopsy found no link with the vaccination.Thailand briefly delays the start of its rollout of the vaccine, but Premier Prayut Chan-O-Cha then receives the jab on Tuesday as the campaign resumes.And the Democratic Republic of Congo, also due to start administering doses, postpones its campaign citing “precautionary measures”.Ireland and the Netherlands join the list on Sunday. Indonesia on Monday says it will “delay” the rollout pending a WHO review into blood clot fears.In a major development, the German health ministry announces it too is halting the jabs, saying a closer look is necessary.President Emmanuel Macron follows saying France will suspend use pending a decision on the vaccine’s safety by the European Medicines Agency.Italy then adds itself to the list, along with Slovenia, Spain, Latvia and Venezuela.Also on Monday, a health worker in Norway dies of a brain haemorrhage after receiving the vaccine, though no direct link to the jab has been established.It is the second such fatality within a few days in the country.Luxembourg, Cyprus and Sweden on Tuesday follow the example of now more than a dozen countries suspending the use of the vaccine."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-experts-to-meet-on-astrazeneca-shot-as-virus-cases-surge/,J&J jab effective in countries with variants: WHO experts,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — WHO safety experts prepared to meet Tuesday over the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine whose rollout has been halted in several European countries over blood clot fears, imperilling the pandemic fight as infection rates surge.The three largest EU nations — Germany, Italy and France — joined others in suspending the shot Monday, dealing a blow to the global immunisation campaign against a disease that has killed more than 2.6 million people.The World Health Organization, AstraZeneca, and the European Medicines Agency have insisted the shot is safe, and that there is no link between the vaccine and reported blood clots.“We do not want people to panic and we would, for the time being, recommend that countries continue vaccinating with AstraZeneca,” WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said Monday.“So far, we do not find an association between these events and the vaccine.”WHO and EMA experts on Tuesday will separately discuss data from AstraZeneca vaccinations, and the European regulator will hold an extraordinary meeting two days later to decide on any further action.AstraZeneca’s shot, among the cheapest available, was billed as the vaccine of choice for poorer nations and the clot reports have had an impact beyond Europe.Indonesia delayed its AstraZeneca rollout on Monday, and Venezuela announced it would not authorise the jab over fears of “complications”.The vaccine was developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford in Britain, where more than 11 million doses have been administered apparently without any major problems.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday also urged Canadians to get the AstraZeneca shot after reports of hesitancy based on the suspensions in Europe. The AstraZeneca crisis comes as a number of countries battle worrying surges in coronavirus infections, a grim reminder that the battle against Covid-19 is far from over.Norway’s capital Oslo announced tougher measures to stop the spread of the virus, including closing secondary schools, as it reported a record number of cases last week.“These will be the most intrusive measures taken by Oslo during the pandemic,” said mayor Raymond Johansen.“It’s tough, it’s difficult but it’s necessary”.And a fresh spike pushed the main Covid-19 hospital in Bosnia to the edge, forcing it to declare a state of emergency.“The staff is exhausted,” hospital director Sebija Izetbegovic wrote on Facebook.“We will continue to do what is possible to save lives, but the situation is really critical. More and more of our employees are sick.”Most of Italy re-entered lockdown on Monday, with schools, restaurants, shops and museums closed, while intensive care doctors in Germany issued an urgent appeal for new restrictions to avoid a third wave in the country.Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro — widely panned for his coronavirus scepticism — appointed a new health minister Monday as the South American nation reeled from another deadly surge in infections and deaths. The pandemic spurred unprecedented efforts to develop vaccines, with a number of successful options now available.Rollouts have been hampered, however, by export controls, bitter diplomatic spats and production issues — in addition to the AstraZeneca suspension.But a new agreement for Germany’s IDT Biologika to help produce the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine would offer Europe greater certainty, Germany’s economy minister said Monday.And the developers of Russia’s successful Sputnik V vaccine said Monday they had reached production agreements in key European countries.China, where the virus first emerged in late 2019, has also developed Covid-19 vaccines and begun exporting them across the world — including to Europe, the Middle East and South America.On Monday, it pledged 300,000 doses to protect United Nations peacekeepers, adding to the 200,000 doses already pledged by India. Neither country specified which type of vaccines would be donated.China has largely brought its outbreak under control, but maintains strict travel restrictions to avoid importing cases.But on Monday it said restrictions have been relaxed for some visitors from the Philippines who have been inoculated — but only if they received a Chinese-made shot."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-insists-astrazeneca-vaccine-safe-as-jab-faces-new-setbacks/,WHO still reviewing safety data on AstraZeneca,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization said there was no reason to stop using AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 jab after several countries suspended rollout over blood clot fears, while the hard-hit United States exceeded 100 million doses of vaccine administered to its people.The WHO, which said its vaccines advisory committee was examining the safety data coming in, Friday stressed that no causal link has been established between the AstraZeneca vaccine and clotting.“Yes, we should continue using the AstraZeneca vaccine,” WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said, stressing that any concerns over safety must be investigated.The Britain-based AstraZeneca insisted its jab was safe, adding there is “no evidence” of higher blood clot risks. Despite hopes that vaccines will pave the way to a return to normality, hard-hit Italy announced tough new restrictions in much of the country, with Prime Minister Mario Draghi warning the country faced “a new wave” of infections.One year after it became the first European country to face a major outbreak, Italy is again struggling with the rapid spread of Covid-19, this time fuelled by new, more contagious variants.Schools, restaurants, shops and museums were ordered to close across most regions of Italy, including Rome and Milan from next week.Disneyland Paris, one of Europe’s biggest tourist attractions, said it will not be able to reopen as planned on April 2 as infections remain stubbornly high in France. The shadow cast over the AstraZeneca jab is adding to the European Union’s problems distributing vaccines.Denmark, Norway and Iceland paused use of the drugmaker’s shot as a precaution after isolated reports of recipients developing blood clots.Italy and Austria have banned the use of jabs from separate batches of AstraZeneca, and Thailand and Bulgaria said this week they would delay rollout.India will carry out a deeper review of post-vaccination side effects from the AstraZeneca shot next week although no cases of blood clots have been reported so far, the Hindustan Times daily quoted officials as saying on Saturday.“The review is taking place as a matter of abundant precaution,” NK Arora from the Indian covid task force told the paper.In Spain at least five regions said they had suspended use of AstraZeneca vaccines from the suspect batch banned by Austria as a precautionary measure.But several other countries, including Australia, said they would continue their rollouts as they had found no reason to alter course. Canada also said there was no evidence the jab causes adverse reactions.In a fresh hit, the EU’s drug regulator said severe allergies should be added to the possible side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine after some likely links were found in Britain. Despite setbacks elsewhere, US President Joe Biden has worked to offer hope to his country, which has battled the largest outbreak in the world.He vowed a return to some kind of normality by July 4, marking the national holiday as his target for “independence” from the virus.After a shaky start, the US has ramped up its vaccination programme, following the advice of scientists who say jabs are the only way out of a pandemic that has killed 2.6 million people around the world.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 100 million vaccine doses have been administered in the US, around 30 percent of the world’s total of shots in arms so far.There was also encouraging news as the WHO approved Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine, paving the way for an additional 500 million doses to enter the Covax global vaccine-sharing scheme.“Every new, safe and effective tool against Covid-19 is another step closer to controlling the pandemic,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.The news comes after the single-dose jab won approval from the European Union on Thursday.It has also received the green light from regulators in the United States, Canada, South Africa and France — which on Friday topped 90,000 coronavirus fatalities.Meanwhile it was announced that India will manufacture at least one billion more Covid-19 vaccine doses by the end of next year in a joint initiative with the United States, Japan and Australia.Following the nations’ first four-way summit, Biden’s national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, said the so-called Quad had made a “massive joint commitment” to vaccines.“The Quad committed to delivering up to one billion doses to ASEAN, the Indo-Pacific and beyond by the end of 2022,” Sullivan said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/uk-says-astrazeneca-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective/,but recommends Covid jabs to continue,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — The UK government on Thursday defended the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine after Denmark suspended the jab’s use, and insisted it would continue with its own rollout.“We’ve been clear that it’s both safe and effective… and when people are asked to come forward and take it, they should do so in confidence,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s official spokesman told reporters.“And in fact you’re starting to see the results of the vaccine programme in terms of the (lower) number of cases we’re seeing across the country, the number of deaths, number of hospitalisations,” he said.Britain began the world’s first mass vaccination drive against the coronavirus in December, underpinned largely by the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab and another from Pfizer-BioNTech.Danish health authorities said they were temporarily suspending the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine after some patients developed blood clots since receiving the jab.The UK spokesman noted that Denmark had stressed there was no confirmed link between the vaccine and the blood clots.Austria announced on Monday that it had suspended the use of one particular batch of the AstraZeneca vaccines, after a 49-year-old nurse died of “severe blood coagulation problems” days after receiving the shot.Four other European countries — Estonia, Latvia, Lithlcuania and Luxemburg — have also suspended the use of vaccines from that batch, which was sent to 17 European countries and consisted of one million jabs.Denmark has however suspended the use of all of its AstraZeneca supply.Asked if the UK government’s medical and scientific advisors were in contact with Denmark, the Downing Street spokesman said it was “regular practice” for experts to exchange information with foreign counterparts."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/new-and-more-contagious-super-covid-variants-possibly-driving-alarming-surge-of-covid-19-cases-in-ncr/,New and more contagious “Super-CoVid” variants possibly driving Covid-19 surge in NCR,1,"(Eagle News) — In a virtual press conference held on March 3, 2021, the OCTA Research Team, an independent and inter-disciplinary Philippine-based research group, shared its latest report which highlights a sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in some local government units (LGUs) in the National Capital Region (NCR), including: Pasay, Quezon City, Manila, Makati, Malabon, Taguig, Paranaque, and Navotas. This surge is possibly being driven by a new and more contagious variant.In its March 1 report, OCTA explained that unlike past surges, “the current surge has spread quickly, in a short period.” Although “this still needs to be confirmed by genome sequencing, the surge may be driven by a new and more contagious variant that could overwhelm the region if left unabated in the next few weeks.”At the start of February 2021, the reproduction number in NCR was Rt = 1.0. By the end of February 2021, it rose to Rt = 1.5. The reproduction number gives the average number of secondary infections by each infected individual.OCTA says, if this trend continues, the number of new Covid-19 cases per day in NCR will increase from its current average daily value of 770 to 2,200 by the end of March 2021. Additionally, the total number of NCR cases will increase to 280,000 from 234,754 cases and 920 new Covid-related deaths will be reported between now and the end of March.Dr. Guido David of the University of the Philippines observed the sharpest two-week increase in the cities of Pasay and Makati.Dr. Nicanor Austriaco, a Molecular Biologist from Providence College, USA and a Visiting Professor at the University of Sto. Tomas (UST), explained that variants, including the B.1.1.7 (UK) and the B.1.351 (South Africa) have triggered significant surges worldwide. “The ongoing surge in Pasay City and the NCR has the hallmarks of a variant-driven surge,” he says.The UK variant, Dr. Austriaco explains, has a 50-70% higher infection rate, and is more transmissible in children, and among members of the same household.The South Africa variant, on the other hand, “can resist the AstraZeneca vaccine” which only has a 10% efficacy rate against this particular variant. It is “no different than injecting water into a person,” he says.Dr. Austriaco believes that “if we do not eliminate the South Africa variant in the Philippines, then the 17 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine that we bought will be ineffective” and that “we would need three doses of the remaining vaccines” for this variant.The Department of Health recently detected six cases of the , three of which are in Pasay.Dr. Benjamin Co, Chief of the Section of Infectious Diseases and Department of Pediatrics in UST Hospital said that so far “none of the vaccines have demonstrated herd immunity.”One reason for this is that vaccines are still in the early stages in clinical trials. Second, as vaccines have not yet been approved for children, achieving a herd immunity of 70% will not be possible if there is a large population of below 18 year-olds. Third, Co-vid has an animal reservoir, which makes achieving herd immunity more challenging. Finally, there is vaccine hesitancy.Dr. Austriaco believes that if Pasay contains the spread, “we still have a window to eliminate the B.1.351 [South Africa variant] from circulation.” He adds that “if [Pasay] can eliminate the B.1.351, then we are safe. Otherwise we have to talk about other options.”OCTA recommends that high-risk local government units (LGUs) should “intensify their efforts at testing, tracing, and isolation, to reverse the increase in transmission in their communities, and implement more aggressive and effective localized lockdowns with stricter border controls.”They urge the national government, together with the LGUs, “to strictly monitor and enforce compliance with minimum health standards such as physical distancing, wearing of face mask and face shields and proper hygiene.”They also encourage the private sector “to ensure strict implementation of minimum health standards in their establishments, provide safe workplaces, and adequate testing as needed.”Finally, given the surge of new cases in the NCR, they encourage health workers in the region and the adjacent provinces “to get themselves vaccinated while the situation is still manageable.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pandemic-having-major-impact-on-childhood-cancer-care-study/,Pandemic having major impact on childhood cancer care: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — The pandemic has had a “substantial” impact on childhood cancer care worldwide, with a marked rise in the number of patients abandoning treatment altogether, new research showed Thursday.Covid-19 has placed huge pressure on hospitals and healthcare systems, particularly in developing nations, as most medical facilities have been inundated with Covid patients.A global assessment of the impact of Covid-19 on paediatric cancer care showed that care was affected at more than three quarters (78 percent) of hospitals.Almost half (43 percent) reported diagnosing fewer new cases than expected, while 34 percent reported a rise in the number of patients who stopped treatment.Perhaps most worryingly, seven precent of hospitals surveyed reported having to close their paediatric cancer units entirely at some stage during the pandemic.The vast majority of these — 87 percent — were in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).“Hospitals in LMICs were under strain even before the pandemic, with fewer resources and less access to care for children with cancer,” said Daniel Moreira, managing director of the US’s St Jude Children’s Research Hospital.“So our results seem to reflect the relative strength of different healthcare systems around the world.”Among the more than 200 hospitals contacted in 79 countries for the survey, 79 percent reported a reduction in child cancer surgery.More than half noted shortages in blood products and 57 percent reported shortages of chemotherapy treatment.The pandemic also diverted resources such as funding and bed base from childhood cancer care, according the survey results published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal.Around one third (32 percent) of hospitals surveyed reported decreased financial support, while 19 percent reported a reduction in available beds.Writing in a linked comment article to the survey, Soad Fuentes-Alabi, of El Salvador’s Ayudame a Vivir Foundation Medical Center said the research showed the struggles experienced by childhood cancer patients in less-developed countries.“The common issues of late diagnosis and treatment abandonment or interruptions have worsened during the pandemic,” she said.© Agence France-Presse"

It should be for every health authority,” Hans Kluge, regional director for WHO Europe, told a press conference.While some studies are beginning to shed light on the illness, it is still unclear why some patients with Covid-19 continue to show symptoms for months, including tiredness, brain fog, and cardiac and neurological disorders.“The burden is real and it is significant. About one in 10 Covid-19 sufferers remain unwell after 12 weeks, and many for much longer,” Kluge said.Noting that reports of long-term symptoms came soon after the disease was first discovered, he said that some patients were “met with disbelief or lack of understanding.”Kluge stressed that those patients “need to be heard if we are to understand the long-term consequences and recovery from Covid-19.”WHO Europe called on European countries and institutions to “come together as part of an integrated research agenda,” harmonising data collection tools and study protocols.The regional director also said he would bring together the 53 member countries of the WHO’s European region, including several countries in Central Asia, “to set out a regional strategy.”In early February, WHO organised the first virtual seminar devoted to so called “Long Covid,” in order to properly define it, give it a formal name and harmonise methods for studying it."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/johnson-johnson-vaccine-highly-effective-against-severe-covid/,Johnson & Johnson vaccine highly effective against severe Covid,1,"The single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine is highly effective in preventing severe Covid-19, including newer variants, according to documents released by the US Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday.The news came as the regulator was set to convene an independent panel Friday that will likely vote to authorize the vaccine, making it the third available in the country hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.In large clinical trials, the J&J vaccine’s efficacy against severe disease was 85.9 percent in the United States, 81.7 percent in South Africa, and 87.6 percent in Brazil.Overall, among 39,321 participants across all regions, the efficacy against severe Covid-19 was 85.4 percent, but it fell to 66.1 percent when including moderate forms of the disease.Crucially, analyses of different demographic groups revealed no marked differences across age, race, or people with underlying conditions.The vaccine was generally well-tolerated, with no reports of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), which have been seen in rare cases for the Pfizer and Moderna shots.Mild to moderate reactions, like injection-site pain, headache, fatigue and muscle pains were more likely to occur in younger participants than older.There were no reported deaths in the vaccine group, but five in the placebo group.“The analysis supported a favorable safety profile with no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA (emergency use authorization),” the FDA wrote.White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters that if authorized, the federal government would seek to distribute three to four million doses next week.“Johnson and Johnson has announced it aims to deliver a total of 20 million doses by the end of March,” he continued, adding the government was trying to speed up the delivery of the contracted 100 million doses, which the company has promised by the end of June. A third vaccine is seen as a vital means to ramp up the immunization rate in the United States, where more than 500,000 people have lost their lives to the coronavirus.Some 65 million people in America have so far received at least one shot of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines — but unlike those, the J&J vaccine requires just one dose, and is stored at fridge temperatures.The trade-off is slightly less protection against mild or moderate forms of Covid-19.“The vaccine was effective in preventing COVID-19 using a less restrictive definition of the disease and for more severe disease, including COVID-19 requiring medical intervention, considering all cases starting 14 days after vaccination,” the FDA wrote in its briefing document.“Although a lower efficacy overall was observed in South Africa, where there was a predominance of B.1.3.5 lineage during the time period of this study, vaccine efficacy against severe/critical COVID-19 was similarly high across the United States, South Africa, and Brazil,” it added.There was a hint, based on preliminary data, that the vaccine might be effective against asymptomatic infection.But “this finding needs to be further investigated with additional data,” wrote the company in a separate document made available by the FDA.The J&J vaccine uses a common-cold causing adenovirus, which has been modified so that it can’t replicate, to carry the DNA for a key protein of the coronavirus into human cells.This makes those cells produce that protein, which in turn trains the human immune system should it encounter the real virus.Other adenovirus vector vaccines against Covid-19 include those made by AstraZeneca-Oxford and Russia’s Sputnik V."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-slams-rich-states-for-hogging-vaccines/,including new variants,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization on Monday blasted wealthy countries for not only hogging Covid vaccines but in doing so, hindering the pathway for poorer nations to get them too.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said some rich countries’ direct deals with manufacturers had meant that previously-agreed vaccine allocations for poorer countries, via the Covax programme, were being reduced.The UN health agency chief said money was available to procure doses for some of the poorest countries, following fresh contributions from the United States, the European Union and Germany — but it was worthless if there was nothing to buy.Tedros urged wealthy nations to check whether their own deals with pharmaceutical companies were undermining Covax, which poorer countries are relying on as they await their first doses.“Even if you have the money, if you cannot use the money to buy vaccines, having the money doesn’t mean anything,” he told a virtual press conference with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. The ONE Campaign, an organisation co-founded by U2 singer Bono, said last week that members of the Group of Seven top industrialised nations along with the rest of the EU plus Australia had collectively bought nearly 1.25 billion more doses than they needed to inoculate every member of their populations against Covid-19.“Some high-income countries are actually approaching manufacturers to secure more vaccines, which is affecting the deals with Covax — and even the amount that was allocated for Covax was reduced because of this,” Tedros said.“We can only have vaccines delivered to the countries who are members of Covax if the high-income countries cooperate in respecting the deals that Covax did.”The first wave of Covax vaccines are to be shipped out between late February and the end of June.Some 145 participating economies are set to receive 337.2 million doses — enough to vaccinate a little over three percent of their combined populations.Covax has said it hopes to raise the figure to up to 27 percent in lower-income countries by the end of December. The world’s biggest vaccine maker, India’s Serum Institute, on Monday urged other countries to be “patient” about it supplying anti-coronavirus shots, saying it has been instructed to prioritise its home market.Steinmeier said that although countries were focused on protecting their own citizens from coronavirus, it made sense for the wealthier nations speeding ahead in the vaccine race to ensure that people in poorer nations were jabbed at the same time.“Governments are first and foremost — and understandably so — committed to their respective publics,” he said.However, “if we refuse to grant the necessary solidarity, we must not be surprised if other countries come in to fill this vacuum by delivering earlier what is required — and using that for their own purposes.”The European Commission is working with pharmaceutical giants to ramp up production of vaccines to between two and three billion doses per year, more than enough for the EU population of 450 million.Visiting the Pfizer-BioNTech plant in Puurs, Belgium, EU Commissioner Thierry Breton said the goal was for Europe to become the number one vaccine producing continent, but that its neighbours would not be forgotten.The EU internal market commissioner said the huge Belgian plant would itself be producing more than a billion doses per year by the end of 2021 and that around half of these were bound for export.“But it’s also important for us to be able, very quickly, to begin giving these doses to all those who need them, in particular our African friends,” Breton told reporters.Earlier, Tedros called for intellectual property rights on Covid-19 medical goods to be waived — a move which could facilitate greater knowledge-sharing and the rapid scale-up of production sites.The idea, currently before the World Trade Organization, is staunchly opposed by pharmaceutical giants.Tedros also urged pharmaceutical companies that were not making their own Covid-19 vaccines to turn over their facilities to produce other companies’ doses, as Sanofi has done for the Pfizer-BioNTech jab.“If we increase the pie, then better opportunities to share it equitably too.”Steinmeier however said he did not think a waiver for patents or licensing “would be the right approach”."

They are believed to have caught the virus from poultry on the farm.“Information about the world’s first case of transmission of the avian flu (H5N8) to humans has already been sent to the World Health Organization,” Popova said.There are different subtypes of avian influenza viruses.While the highly contagious strain H5N8 is lethal for birds, it had never before been reported to have spread to humans.Popova praised “the important scientific discovery”, saying “time will tell” if the virus can further mutate.“The discovery of these mutations when the virus has not still acquired an ability to transmit from human to human gives us all, the entire world, time to prepare for possible mutations and react in an adequate and timely fashion,” Popova said.The WHO confirmed on Saturday that it had been notified by Russia about the development.“We are in discussion with national authorities to gather more information and assess the public health impact of this event,” a spokesperson said.“If confirmed, this would be the first time H5N8 infects people.”WHO stressed that the Russian workers were “asymptomatic” and no onward human-to-human transmission had been reported.People can get infected with avian and swine influenza viruses, such as bird flu subtypes A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) and swine flu subtypes such as A(H1N1).According to the WHO, people usually get infected through direct contact with animals or contaminated environments, and there is no sustained transmission among humans.H5N1 in people can cause severe illness and has a 60 percent mortality rate. Gwenael Vourc’h, head of research at France’s National Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment, said that influenza viruses are known to evolve “quite quickly” and that there might have been other cases besides those reported in Russia.“This is probably the tip of the iceberg,” she told AFP.Francois Renaud, a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), said however that he was “not particularly worried” at this stage.He added that the coronavirus pandemic had taught countries to react quickly to potential health threats. “Draconian measures will be taken to immediately stop the outbreak,” he said.Avian flu has raged in several European countries including France, where hundreds of thousands of birds have been culled to stop the infection.Russia’s Vektor State Virology and Biotechnology Center, which detected the transmission to the poultry farm workers, also developed one of the country’s several coronavirus vaccines.In the Soviet era the lab, located in Koltsovo outside the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, conducted secret biological weapons research.It still stockpiles viruses ranging from Ebola to smallpox.In televised remarks, Vektor chief Rinat Maksyutov said the lab was ready to begin developing test kits that would help detect potential cases of H5N8 in humans and to begin work on a vaccine.The Soviet Union was a scientific powerhouse and Russia has sought to reclaim a leadership role in vaccine research under President Vladimir Putin.Russia registered coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V in August, months before Western competitors and even before large-scale clinical trials.After initial scepticism in the West, the Lancet journal this month published results showing the Russian vaccine — named after the Soviet-era satellite — to be safe and effective."

Goldman underwent hip replacement surgery last year.“It was not easy going, it was challenging,” Goldman told the paper of her winter hike.She got to her appointment just five minutes late.Goldman’s daughter Ruth said she is a tough lady.“My mother isn’t going to let a little snow stop her from getting the vaccine,” the younger Goldman said.“She was willing to walk however many miles there and back to get it,” she told the Seattle Times.“She is a really remarkable person who has the attitude of ‘You don’t let a little adversity get in your way.'”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/un-urges-global-covid-vaccine-plan-warns-of-dangerous-inequity/,90-year old US woman treks miles in snow to get vaccinated,1,"UNITED Nations (AFP) — The United Nations on Wednesday led calls for a coordinated global effort to vaccinate against Covid-19, warning that gaping inequities in initial efforts put the whole planet at risk.Foreign ministers met virtually for a first-ever UN Security Council session on vaccinations called by current chair Britain, which said the world had a “moral duty” to act together against the pandemic that has killed more than 2.4 million people.Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced alarm that just 10 nations have administered 75 percent of doses so far — and 130 countries have had none at all.“The world urgently needs a global vaccination plan to bring together all those with the required power, scientific expertise and production and financial capacities,” Guterres said.He said the Group of 20 major economies was in the best position to set up a task force on financing and implementation of global vaccinations and offered full support of the United Nations.“If the virus is allowed to spread like wildfire in the Global South, it will mutate again and again. New variants could become more transmissible, more deadly and, potentially, threaten the effectiveness of current vaccines and diagnostics,” Guterres said.“This can prolong the pandemic significantly, enabling the virus to come back to plague the Global North.”Henrietta Fore, head of the UN children’s agency UNICEF, said: “The only way out of this pandemic for any of us is to ensure vaccinations are available for all of us.” Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard denounced the “injustice” of what he called a “deepening gap” as wealthy countries “monopolize the vaccines.”There is already a plan to help developing nations — Covax is an initiative funded by donors and governments that aims to procure two billion vaccine doses in 2021 with options for a further billion.Covax will soon be able to start delivery of vaccines after the World Health Organization approved the shot developed by AstraZeneca, on which the initiative is almost entirely reliant in its first wave.But aid groups say that many people still risk being left out due to a shortfall in Covax funding to arrange the administration and delicate transportation of vaccines as well as conflicts that make inoculation efforts impossible.Britain, one of the largest contributors to Covax with a commitment of £548 million ($760 million), reiterated a UN call for temporary ceasefires to allow vaccinations, estimating that more than 160 million people were at risk in conflict zones.“We have a moral duty to act, and a strategic necessity to come together to defeat this virus,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.In his first Security Council appearance, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken vowed that President Joe Biden’s administration would take a leadership role after reversing Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the World Health Organization.Blinken said the United States would pay up its more than $200 million in obligations to the UN body by the end of the month and make a “significant” contribution to Covax.“The United States will work as a partner to address global challenges,” Blinken said. But Blinken vowed to press for improvements in the WHO, which Trump, under fire for his own handling of the pandemic, accused of being beholden to China and not stopping the deadly virus.“All countries must make available all data from the earliest days of any outbreak,” Blinken said, in a veiled renewal of US criticism that China has not cooperated with a WHO probe into how the virus first emerged in 2019 in Wuhan.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned in his remarks against “attempts to politicize the pandemic” and renewed Beijing’s offer of 10 million doses of its homegrown vaccine to Covax.“We should come together to reject vaccine nationalism,” he said.One immediate question for the United Nations is whether its own peacekeepers should have priority in vaccination.India, a leading exporter of vaccines, announced a donation of 200,000 doses for UN peacekeepers.“The pharmacy of the world is stepping forward to meet the global vaccines challenge,” Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said.One discordant voice at the Security Council was Russia, which has been promoting its own vaccine and only put forward its UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, to the UN session.He said that vaccinations were a matter “for specialized UN agencies” and “exceed the jurisdiction of the Security Council.”"

You can kick it, you can drop it, you can leave it in the sun, it doesn’t care, it’s going to operate until it runs out of cryogen,” said Marani.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/ebola-profile-of-a-prolific-killer/,Ebola: profile of a prolific killer,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — A factfile on the Ebola virus that has plunged Guinea into an “epidemic situation” according to a senior health official, and which has killed more than 15,000 people since 1976. Ebola was first identified in central Africa in 1976. The tropical virus was named after a river in the Democratic Republic of Congo — then known as Zaire.Five of the virus species are known to cause disease in humans — Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo, Reston and Tai Forest.The first three species have resulted in serious African outbreaks. The virus’ natural reservoir animal is probably the bat, which does not itself fall ill, but can pass the germ on to humans who hunt it for “bushmeat”.Other dinnertime favourites in parts of Africa — chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines — are also suspected of transmitting Ebola.Among humans, the virus is passed on by contact with the blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected or recently deceased person. This can include touching a sick or dead person, and likely also sexual intercourse.Those infected do not become contagious until symptoms appear. They become more and more contagious until just after their death, which poses great risks during funerals.Death rates are high, at around 50 percent on average of those infected, and up to 90 percent for some epidemics, World Health Organization (WHO) data shows. Following an incubation period of between two and 21 days, Ebola develops into a high fever, weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat.The initial symptoms are often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding.After effects have often been observed in survivors, including arthritis, problems with vision, eye inflammation and hearing difficulties. A vaccine developed by the US group Merck Shape and Dohme was found to be very effective in a major study carried out in Guinea in 2015.It was pre-qualified by the WHO and more than 300,000 doses have been used during a vaccination programme in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).A second experimental vaccine developed by the US group Johnson & Johnson was introduced preventively in October 2019 in areas that had not been affected by the virus, and more than 20,000 people were inoculated. The worst-ever Ebola outbreak began in December 2013 in southern Guinea before spreading to two neighbouring west African countries, Liberia and Sierra Leone.That outbreak killed more than 11,300 people out of nearly 29,000 registered cases, according to WHO estimates. The 10th epidemic began on August 1, 2018 in the North Kivu province of DR Congo, and was declared a global health threat in July 2019 by the WHO.It was declared over in June 2020 by DR Congo authorities after around 2,280 people had died, making it Africa’s second worst Ebola outbreak ever.An 11th Ebola epidemic began that month in the Equator province and was declared over on November 18, with 55 deaths. On February 7, the DR Congo said a resurgence of the virus had been identified in an eastern part of the country.A week later, a senior health official in Guinea said that country was in an “epidemic situation” after seven cases were confirmed in the southeast, three of which had resulted in deaths.They were the first Ebola fatalities in Guinea since 2016.A local WHO official said the organisation would send vaccines quickly to help keep the virus from spreading."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/no-end-to-pandemic-without-equal-vaccine-access-experts/,No end to pandemic without equal vaccine access: experts,1,"Developing new Covid-19 vaccines will fail to end the pandemic unless all countries receive doses in a fast and fair manner, disease experts warned Saturday.As several nations consider implementing vaccine passports when international travel resumes, the authors of an open letter published in the Lancet medical journal said vaccine stockpiling in wealthier countries would only prolong the global health emergency.They warned that “vaccine nationalism” could leave the Covax initiative aimed at getting vaccines to low- and middle-income countries facing a huge dosage shortfall for several years to come.“The stark reality is that the world now needs more doses of COVID-19 vaccines than any other vaccine in history in order to immunise enough people to achieve global vaccine immunity,” said lead author Olivier Wouters from the London School of Economics and Political Science.“Unless vaccines are distributed more equitably, it could be years before the coronavirus is brought under control at a global level.”Despite there being more than two dozen Covid-19 vaccines either in development or approved for use, lower income countries still have enormous logistical challenges to procure immunisations and deliver them to populations.These include a lack of funds to purchase vaccines, as well as poor infrastructure to transport and store them — especially since the mRNA vaccines on the market currently need to be kept ultra cold throughout their delivery.And despite unprecedented public and private investment in vaccine development and procurement, Covax estimates it will need an additional $6.8 billion in 2021 to secure supplies for 92 developing nations.Based on available sales figures, the authors said that rich nations representing 16 percent of the global population had already secured 70 percent of vaccine doses — enough to inoculate every one of their owns citizen several times over.“Securing large quantities of vaccines in this way amounts to countries placing widespread vaccination of their own populations ahead of the vaccination of health-care workers and high-risk populations in poorer countries,” said co-author Mark Jit from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.The letter called on manufacturers to accelerate technology transfer to developing nations to help them produce doses domestically, as well as price controls for what it termed “prohibitively expensive” vaccines currently on the market.The authors said that vaccines developed by China, India and Russia, once authorised by the World Health Organization, could be a big help to poorer nations as their supply and storage were simpler than the US/European alternatives."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/virus-expected-to-last-long-term-despite-global-vaccine-rollout/,Virus expected to last long-term despite global vaccine rollout,1,"STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AFP) — The head of the EU’s disease control agency warned Friday that the novel coronavirus could last indefinitely even as global infections slowed by nearly half in the last month and vaccine rollouts gathered pace in parts of the world.In an interview with AFP, ECDC chief Andrea Ammon urged European countries in particular not to drop their guard against a virus that “seems very well adapted to humans” and may require experts to tweak vaccines over time, as is the case with the seasonal flu.“So we should be prepared that it will remain with us,” according to Ammon, head of the Stockholm-based European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.After the latest harsh wave of a pandemic that started in China more than a year ago, glimmers of hope flickered as an AFP database showed the rate of new Covid-19 infections has slowed by 44.5 percent worldwide over the past month.More than 107 million people have been infected worldwide and nearly 2.4 million have died from Covid-19.But disease experts warned that vaccines won’t end the pandemic unless all countries receive doses in a fast and fair manner.Writing in an open letter published in the Lancet medical journal, the authors said with vaccine stockpiling in wealthier countries, “it could be years before the coronavirus is brought under control at a global level.”The warning came as US vaccine maker Moderna said it was seeking clearance with regulators around the world to put 50 percent more coronavirus vaccine into each of its vials as a way to quickly boost current supply levels.In Britain, a marked drop in infections and accelerating vaccinations have prompted some within the governing Conservative Party to push for stay-at-home rules to be lifted in early March.Much of the country re-entered lockdown in early January to curb a more transmissible Covid-19 variant first identified in the UK.The British government nonetheless voiced caution, a watchword echoed elsewhere, including Italy, Portugal and Australia.– In Australia, more than six million people in Melbourne and its surrounding area were under an emergency five-day coronavirus lockdown.“It’s rough. It’s going to be a rough few days for everyone,” said tennis star Serena Williams, reacting to the lockdown moments after her latest victory at the Australian Open.While play will continue under the restrictions, fans will no longer be permitted and players must restrict themselves to biosecure “bubbles”.The toll on sports, entertainment and economies continued to be massive.The Tokyo Olympic Games are due to open in July after multiple delays.But the games organisers are already battling public misgivings about holding the huge international event this summer. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen urged the 27 EU member countries to accelerate ratification of a key part of the bloc’s 750-billion-euro ($900-billion) plan to recover from the impact of the pandemic.The UK — which has left the EU and has Europe’s highest virus death toll after a heavily criticised initial response to the pandemic — reported that the economy shrank a record 9.9 percent last year.Finance minister Rishi Sunak admitted the impact would be a “serious shock” and warned: “We should expect the economy to get worse before it gets better.”Hungary meanwhile said it will become the first EU nation to start using Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine.The country broke ranks with the EU last month by becoming the first bloc member to approve Sputnik V, ordering two million doses to be delivered over three months, enough to vaccinate one million people.Russia registered Sputnik V in August, months ahead of Western competitors but before the start of large-scale clinical trials, which left some experts wary.However, recent results published in The Lancet found that the vaccine is 91.6 percent effective against Covid-19.Some EU leaders seem to be warming to the idea of deploying Sputnik V as the bloc struggles with supply shortfalls for the three vaccines it has approved. The European Medicines Agency has so far approved vaccines for the bloc developed by US-German firm Pfizer-BioNTech, US firm Moderna and British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca with Oxford University.The EMA said Friday it had started a “rolling review” of a vaccine from German manufacturer CureVac, the first step towards possible authorisation.In the United States — the world’s hardest-hit country with more than 480,000 deaths — health authorities on Friday urged schools to reopen safely and as soon as possible, offering a detailed plan for limiting the spread of Covid-19.The strategy emphasizes universal masking, handwashing, disinfection and contact tracing. While recommending vaccination for teachers and staff, it stops short of saying it is necessary — a divisive issue among teachers’ unions.The push comes as the United States is in the midst of an aggressive mass vaccination campaign, with a goal of inoculating nearly all Americans by the end of July.Hard-hit Brazil’s drive to vaccinate its population has stumbled this week as a lack of doses forced authorities to slow or halt immunisation in several key areas.But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada’s Covid-19 vaccines rollout will be back on track in March with stepped up deliveries of doses to make up for recent delays.© Agence France-Presse"

But more and more institutions are now pushing paid options also.Presley’s home Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee, has been offering two-hour-long tours by guide Angie Marchese for $100 a head since January.Some 300 people, the maximum capacity, signed up for each of the first two virtual tours in which they hear anecdotes about Presley, see objects he owned and can ask questions about his life.In December, Barbara Brown-Abolafia took her students from Bergen Community College in New Jersey on a virtual trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to see the exhibition “A New Look at Old Masters.”Unlike at Graceland, an expert guide did not roam the room, with the Met saying it was constrained by health measures linked to Covid-19.“It was a slide-show format, so it felt more like a class,” recalled Brown-Abolafia.But the quality of the presentation and its interactive nature with a live chat for questions made up for it, according to the English teacher, who grew up in New York and has visited the museum in person several times.“Does it compare to being inside the Met? Of course not. But it was mentally stimulating,” she said.Before the virtual visit, Brown-Abolafia had explained the profile of her pupils to the expert.“She accommodated us by not going over their heads, but not making it too simplified.“In fact, it was so interesting that it went over an hour by about 20 minutes,” said Brown-Abolafia.The Met began the tours in June. Between July and December the famous museum held 116 virtual tours, for over 2,800 adult visitors in total.They cost $300 per group of up to 40 adults, or $200 for a group of students.The Met also hosted nearly 4,000 schoolchildren, including foreign students, via computer screens between July and December, with demand growing, according to the institution.The Met said it was also committed to continuing the other free programs it runs.Other New York museums, including the Guggenheim, the Frick Collection and the 9/11 Memorial are all offering paid virtual tours. The Louvre in Paris, the most visited museum in the world, has not offered the same but is considering it, a spokesperson said.Video tours on services like Zoom and Teams are becoming commonplace during the pandemic, according to Michael Burns of Quatrefoil Associates, a firm that specializes in laying out exhibitions.“The idea that they can somehow have an experience that is more unique to them because it’s private, I think there’ll be people willing to pay for that,” he told AFP.He says that while nothing beats being physically in the same room as the artwork, the pandemic has “opened up a new niche” of private virtual tours.In an increasingly globalized world, where demand for culture continues to grow, the potential for paying to experience famous works remotely is substantial, experts say.“Onsite tours will always be the core component of our offerings,” said Debbie Miller, chief marketing officer for Elvis Presley Enterprises, which manages Graceland.Yet “we recognize there are many people who are unable to travel to Memphis so the ability to bring Graceland to them virtually, while earning some additional revenue, is a win-win,” she added."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/uk-scientists-develop-urine-test-to-detect-womb-cancer/,UK scientists develop urine test to detect womb cancer,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — British scientists announced on Friday they had developed a test to detect womb cancer using urine samples, explaining the method could replace a painful and invasive procedure currently in use.At present, clinicians diagnose the cancer by taking a biopsy, a process which requires a narrow telescope called a hysteroscope, to examine inside of the uterus and remove cells.Nearly a third of women who undergo the procedure have the process repeated because of technical difficulties or intolerable pain, the research showed.Thousands of women in Britain who do not have womb cancer also undergo the procedure, with huge financial implications for the country’s state-run National Health Service (NHS).The study from Manchester University has developed a new detection tool which examines urine or vaginal samples that can be collected by women on their own at home.The findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, showed analysis of the samples correctly diagnosed 91.7 percent of women with womb cancer.The proportion of women without womb cancer who tested negative with the new tool was 88.9 percent, the study showed.“Our results show that womb cancer cells can be detected in urine and vaginal samples using a microscope,” said Professor Emma Crosbie, who led the study.“Women who test positive with this test could be referred for diagnostic investigations while women who test negative are safely reassured without the need for unpleasant, invasive, anxiety-provoking and expensive procedures.”The new tool was first trialled on 103 women with known cancer and 113 with unexplained postmenopausal bleeding and could be brought into clinical practice once expanded trials have concluded.Womb cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women, with an estimated 382,000 new diagnoses and 89,900 deaths from the disease in 2018 worldwide, the university said.While most women receive early treatment after the onset of symptoms, which include bleeding after menopause, 20 percent of women who are diagnosed at an advanced stage have only a 15 percent chance of surviving beyond five years."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/astrazeneca-covid-jab-less-effective-against-safrican-strain-study/,AstraZeneca Covid jab ‘less effective against SAfrican strain’: study,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine fails to prevent mild and moderate cases of the South African coronavirus strain, according to research reported in the Financial Times.But in its study, due to be published Monday, the pharma group said it could still have an effect on severe disease — although there is not yet enough data to make a definitive judgement.None of the 2,000 participants in the trial developed serious symptoms, the FT said, but AstraZeneca said the sample size was too small to make a full determination.“We may not be reducing the total number of cases but there is still protection against deaths, hospitalisations and severe disease,” said Sarah Gilbert, who led the development of the vaccine with the Oxford Vaccine Group.It could also be “some time” before they determine its effectiveness for older people in fighting the strain, which is a growing presence in Britain, she told BBC television.“We might have to put it together from a number of studies,” she said.Researchers are currently working to update the vaccine, and “have a version with the South African spike sequence in the works” that they would “very much like” to be ready for the autumn, said Gilbert.UK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government’s strategy to combat the spread of the strain was to continue with its mass vaccination programme “as rapidly as possible” as well as “hyper-local surge testing” in areas where it is detected.Britain is in the midst of a massive vaccination drive, which it sees as its way out of one of the worst outbreaks in the world that has seen more than 112,000 fatalities among those testing positive for the virus.It has so far vaccinated over 11 million people using either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Oxford/Astrazeneca shots.The AstraZeneca vaccine has been the source of an ugly row with the European Union, which is angry that the Anglo-Swedish firm was unable to meet the delivery target agreed with Brussels.France, Germany and Switzerland are also among countries to recommend the jab not be used in the elderly due to a lack of data."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/climate-change-may-have-had-key-role-in-pandemic-study/,Climate change may have had ‘key role’ in pandemic: study,1,"Climate change may have played a “key role” in the transmission of the novel coronavirus to humans by driving several species of pathogen-carrying bats into closer contact, research showed on Friday.The virus, which has killed more than two million people and caused unprecedented global disruption, is thought to have originated in bats in Southeast Asia.Researchers from the University of Cambridge used temperature and rainfall data over the last 100 years to model populations of dozens of bat species based on their habitat requirements.They found that over the last century, 40 species had relocated to southern China, Laos and Myanmar — the area where genetic analysis suggests the virus known as SARS-CoV-2 first appeared.Since each bat species carries an average of 2.7 coronaviruses, the researchers said 100 strains of coronavirus were now concentrated in this “hotspot” area.“Our paper is a long way away from saying the pandemic would not have happened without climate change,” lead author Robert Meyer of Cambridge’s zoology department told AFP.“But I find it difficult to see that this climate-driven increase in bats and bat-borne coronaviruses make something like this less likely to happen.”While the precise chain of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animals to humans is yet to be determined, Beyer said the changing climate and habitat destruction in Asia had driven virus-carrying species into ever closer contact with human populations.“It’s two sides of a similar coin: we penetrate deeper into their habitat but at the same time climate change can have the effect that it pushes the pathogen in our direction,” he said. The study, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, urged governments to take measures including limiting urban expansion and farming, which it said would help to manage the risk of another pandemic of a disease endemic in wild animals.It also called for greater effort to mitigate climate change to avoid large accumulations of wild species near human habitation.“The fact that climate change can accelerate the transmission of wildlife pathogens to humans should be an urgent wake-up call to reduce global emissions,” said Camilo Mora at the University of Hawaii, who contributed to the research.Kate Jones, Professor of Ecology and Biodiversity at University College London, said Friday’s research was interesting but that the pandemic was a result of a variety of factors.“Climate change certainly has a role to play in changing species distributions to increase ecological hazard,” said Jones, who was not involved in the study.“However, spillover risk is a complex interplay of not only ecological hazard but human exposure and vulnerability.”Habitat loss, for example, has also been a major driver in pushing wild animal species closer to human populations."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/jj-requests-emergency-authorization-for-covid-vaccine/,J&J requests emergency authorization for Covid vaccine,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Pharmaceuticals giant Johnson & Johnson on Thursday submitted an application for emergency authorization of its Covid-19 vaccine with US health authorities, the company said in a statement.The process could take several weeks, but at the end of it the vaccine would be the third authorized in the United States, after those of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.J&J subsidiary Janssen Biotech “has submitted an application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for its investigational single-dose Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate,” the statement read.The new vaccine is highly anticipated because it has two big logistical advantages: it can be stored at refrigerator temperatures rather than in special freezers, significantly easing distribution; and it requires just one dose.Following J&J’s request, the FDA is expected to convene its advisory committee on vaccines, which will deliver its opinion after studying the data from clinical trials.It will be responsible for determining whether the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.That step took about three weeks for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, but could be faster this time around. The final green light will then be given, probably the next day.J&J announced at the end of last week the first results of its clinical trials, carried out on nearly 44,000 people in eight countries.The vaccine was overall 66 percent effective, the company said. And it is 85 percent effective in preventing severe forms of the disease.But these results also raised a concern: the shot was more effective in the United States (72 percent), than in South Africa (57 percent), where a variant that had appeared in the country has now became dominant."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/oxford-to-run-trial-alternating-covid-19-vaccines/,Oxford to run trial alternating Covid-19 vaccines,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — Oxford University announced on Thursday it will launch a medical trial alternating doses of Covid-19 vaccines created by different manufacturers, the first study of its kind.The trial will show whether different Covid doses — those created by the Astrazeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech pharmaceutical companies — can be used interchangeably to allow greater flexibility in pressured vaccine delivery schedules.The British government’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said the trial would offer “greater insight” into the use of vaccines against Covid.“Given the inevitable challenges of immunising large numbers of the population against Covid-19 and potential global supply constraints, there are definite advantages to having data that could support a more flexible immunisation programme,” Van-Tam said.“It is also even possible that by combining vaccines, the immune response could be enhanced giving even higher antibody levels that last longer,” he added.The 13-month study will compare different combinations of prime and booster doses of the Astrazeneca and Pfizer vaccines at intervals of four and 12 weeks.Britain, the first western nation to launch its vaccination programme, has bucked the international trend by administering vaccines at an interval of 12 weeks in a bid to give a first dose of the vaccine to more individuals.Professor Matthew Snape from Oxford University called the study “extremely exciting”, adding that it would provide “information vital to the roll out of vaccines in the UK and globally”.If the study shows positive results, Britain’s independent medicines regulator would formally assess the safety and efficacy of any new vaccination regimen before it is rolled out to patients.Disagreements between the UK and the European Union over vaccine supplies have boiled over in recent weeks with Brussels moving to restrict vaccine exports to Northern Ireland on Thursday before the plans were abandoned in a swift U-turn.In the following days, EU member states and the European Commission have continued to criticise the English-Swedish drugs manufacturer AstraZeneca over slow vaccine delivery and the efficacy of the jab has also been called into question.On Wednesday, the British government seized on a separate study that said the AstraZeneca vaccine — which was developed in partnership with Oxford University — significantly reduces virus transmission and is highly protective after a single dose.AstraZeneca and Oxford University said on Wednesday vaccines against new developing coronavirus variants should be ready by October.©"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/whos-covax-facility-sets-out-vaccination-plans-in-first-distribution-list/,WHO’s Covax Facility sets out vaccination plans in first distribution list,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The Covax programme for Covid-19 vaccines published its first distribution list Wednesday, planning enough doses for dozens of countries to immunise more than three percent of their populations by mid-year.The list comes with concerns over whether lower-income countries will be left out of the immunisation race dominated by rich nations, a problem Covax was set up to resolve.It broke down for the first time how the programme’s initial 337.2 million doses will be distributed, with first deliveries expected in late February.Some 145 countries are set to receive enough doses to immunise 3.3 percent of their population by mid-2021.A statement said the initial distribution was in line with a target “to protect the most vulnerable groups such as health care workers” in the first half of the year.Countries will receive doses in proportion to population size, with the most going to India (97.2 million), Pakistan (17.2 million), Nigeria (16 million), Indonesia (13.7 million), Bangladesh (12.8 million) and Brazil (10.6 million).“This is fantastic. We can start vaccinating. It is coming in the next weeks,” Ann Lindstrand, coordinator for a World Health Organisation immunisation programme, told a press conference.Covax is co-led by the WHO, the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).Funding is covered through donations for the 92 lower- and lower-middle income economies involved, while for richer countries, buying in operates as a back-up insurance policy for their own vaccination programmes.The distribution list includes 240 million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, licensed to the Serum Institute of India (SII); 96 million doses of AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine; and 1.2 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the only one so far to have received emergency use approval from the WHO. Evaluation is under way for the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine.Both require two injected doses.Wealthy self-financing countries were on the list in addition to lower-income nations, including South Korea (2.6 million doses), Canada (1.9 million) and New Zealand (250,000).The list is non-binding and may change, the statement stressed, but would allow countries to plan for how many doses they will receive in the first rounds.Longer term, Covax aims to secure enough vaccines for at least the most vulnerable 20 percent in participating countries by the end of 2021."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-team-visits-chinese-virus-lab-in-wuhan/,WHO team visits Chinese virus lab in Wuhan,1,"WUHAN, China (AFP) — World Health Organization inspectors visited a laboratory in China’s Wuhan city on Wednesday that American officials suggested could have been the source of the coronavirus.The inspection of the Wuhan virology institute, which conducts research on the world’s most dangerous diseases, will be one of the most-watched stops on the team’s probe into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.The sensitive mission, which China had delayed throughout the first year of the pandemic, has a remit to explore how the virus jumped from animal to human.But questions remain over what the experts can hope to find after so much time has passed.The convoy of cars drove past security to enter a virology institute shrouded in mist Wednesday morning, with the first car pausing briefly to take questions from journalists.WHO team member Peter Daszak said the team was “looking forward to a very productive day and to asking all the questions that we know need to be asked”.Scientists think Covid-19 — which first emerged in Wuhan and has gone on to kill more than two million people worldwide — originated in bats and could have been transmitted to people via another mammal.But there are no definitive answers so far.There was speculation early in the pandemic that the virus could have accidentally leaked from the biosafety lab in Wuhan, although there was no evidence to back up that theory. Then-US president Donald Trump and his supporters seized on those rumours and amplified them with conspiracy theories that China deliberately leaked the virus.The US-secretary of state Mike Pompeo insisted last year that there was “significant evidence” that the virus came from the lab, while releasing no proof and acknowledging that there was no certainty.Chinese state broadcaster CGTN said the WHO team would “visit the national biosafety laboratory and exchange ideas with experts of the institute on their daily work, international scientific cooperation, anti-epidemic efforts and contribution”.China has faced criticism at home and abroad for playing down the initial outbreak and concealing information when it first emerged in Wuhan in December 2019.But Daszak told journalists on Tuesday the mission was proceeding “very well”, as the group was driven into an animal disease control centre.China is also determined to put the focus on its recovery from the outbreak, and the WHO team toured a propaganda exhibition celebrating China’s recovery from the pandemic in Wuhan on Saturday.On Sunday the team went to the market in Wuhan where one of the first reported clusters of infections emerged over a year ago, which Daszak tweeted was a “critical” stop.Shi Zhengli, one of China’s leading experts on bat coronaviruses and deputy director of the Wuhan lab, raised some eyebrows in a June 2020 interview with Scientific American magazine in which she said she was initially anxious over whether the virus had leaked from the facility.But subsequent checks revealed that none of the gene sequences matched the viruses held by the lab, Shi said, adding: “I had not slept a wink for days.”She later said she would “bet her life that (the new coronavirus) had nothing to do with the lab”, according to Chinese state media."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/some-us-pharmacies-will-offer-covid-vaccines-from-february-11/,Some US pharmacies will offer Covid vaccines from February 11,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The United States will begin to offer Covid-19 vaccines at pharmacies from February 11, part of efforts to rapidly increase the rate at which shots reach arms.The White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters on Tuesday that because of supply constraints, the program would initially be limited to 6,500 participating pharmacies nationwide, before eventually expanding to 40,000.“This will provide more sites for people to get vaccinated in their communities. And it’s an important component to delivering vaccines equitably,” he said.Major chains like Walgreens, CVS Pharmacy, Walmart and Rite Aid are among those participating and the program is planned to work on an appointment basis, as people become eligible on the basis of their priority group.The administration will allocate a million doses to the pharmacies in the first week, in addition to 10.5 million doses it is allocating to states and other territories starting this week.The state allocations are up 22 percent since January 20, when the administration of President Joe Biden took office, according to a statement.More than 32.2 million shots have so far been administered, with just under six million people receiving both doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, according to the latest official data.After initial bottlenecks, states are ramping up their vaccine administration rate while the federal government is working with vaccine makers to try to increase supply.The Biden administration is targeting 150 million shots injected within its first 100 days of office — April 20. It’s widely expected that authorities will soon clear a third vaccine for emergency use, after Johnson & Johnson last week announced results from a multi-continent trial that showed its shot was effective, especially against severe Covid.Though less protective than Pfizer and Moderna’s, J&J’s vaccine has the advantages of being one-shot, and storable at fridge temperatures rather than in deep freezers.Also Tuesday, the Biden administration announced it would reimburse states for their Covid-related emergency funds and national guard deployments going back to January 2020, a move that would free up $3-$5 billion the states could then use on vaccine rollout efforts.Scientists warn the world is now in a race between vaccines and the coronavirus.Allowing the virus to replicate unchecked increases the odds it will mutate in ways that reduce the protection offered by current vaccines, or gain other advantages like being more contagious or even more deadly.Current vaccines and synthetic antibody treatments have already been shown to be less effective against a variant that was first identified in South Africa.This variant also poses a significant reinfection risk to people previously infected with the more common strain of the coronavirus, research has shown, especially if their cases were mild and they didn’t mount a strong antibody response."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/more-than-100-million-vaccinated/,More than 100 million vaccinated worldwide,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — More than 100 million Covid-19 vaccines have been given around the world, an AFP tally from official sources found Tuesday.But none of the world’s 29 poorest countries has formally started mass vaccination drives, while the richest nations have given more than two-thirds of jabs administered.Israel leads the race by far, with 37 percent of its population having received at least one dose, while more than a fifth have already got their second.Yet more than a third of humanity (35 percent) live in countries where vaccination has yet to begin.After Israel, the countries that have given the most doses are in North America, Europe and the Persian Gulf.The UK heads this group in per capita terms with shots given to 13.7 percent of its people, ahead of the US (32.2 million shots to 7.9 percent).The European Union has been clashing bitterly with AstraZeneca over access to supplies of its vaccine, with only 12.7 million shots given to 2.3 percent of its people.China by contrast has given 24 million shots, while India — where many of the vaccines are made — has given only four million to a tiny percentage of its vast population.The EU’s best performing countries are tiny Malta (5.4 percent), Denmark (3.2 percent) and Poland (3.1 percent).The UK’s nearest competitor in Europe is Serbia, which is also outside the bloc.It has given the Chinese Sinopharm and Russia’s Sputnik V jabs to 6.2 percent of its population.With the World Health Organization lamenting that “rich countries are rolling out vaccines while least-developed countries watch and wait,” 101,317,005 jabs had been given in 77 mostly wealthy countries and territories, AFP’s count found.Some rich countries, however, have yet to start vaccinating, including Japan, South Korea and Australia, which have managed to contain the pandemic with strict border controls and quarantines.The first deliveries of the WHO’s Covax scheme to share shots more fairly are due begin this month. So far only Guinea has benefited, with only a few dozen given in a pilot trial.There are currently seven vaccines circulating around the world, all designed to be given in two doses.The vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech (US-German) and Moderna (US) are dominant in North America, Europe, Israel and the Gulf.Britain’s AstraZeneca-Oxford is used in much of the UK and India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Morocco, and is soon to be rolled out in Europe.India also uses a homegrown vaccine produced by Bharat Biotech.Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine has been rolled out in Russia, Argentina, Algeria, Belarus and Serbia.China’s Sinopharm jabs are being administered in China, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Serbia the Seychelles and Jordan, while Indonesia and Turkey are using China’s Sinovac vaccine.China’s Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines and Russia’s Sputnik V jab have yet to be fully approved by either Beijing or Moscow’s health authorities."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-virus-probe-team-visits-china-propaganda-exhibit-hospital-in-wuhan/,WHO virus probe team visits China propaganda exhibit,1,"WUHAN, China (AFP) — A team of WHO experts investigating the origins of the coronavirus toured a propaganda exhibition celebrating China’s recovery from the pandemic in Wuhan on Saturday, after a meeting at the hospital that treated the first confirmed Covid-19 cases over a year ago.Details of the trip have been scant so far, with the media kept at arm’s length and information on the itinerary dribbling out via tweets from the World Health Organization experts instead of China’s tight-lipped Communist authorities.The group was driven to the Jinyintan Hospital, the first to receive officially diagnosed Covid-19 patients in late 2019, as the horrors of the virus emerged in the central Chinese city.In a tweet, team member Peter Daszak welcomed the hospital visit as an “Important opportunity to talk directly w/ medics who were on the ground at that critical time fighting COVID!”On Saturday afternoon, the team visited a cavernous exhibition that applauds the emergency response of Wuhan health authorities in the chaotic, terrifying early stages of the outbreak — as well as the agility of the Communist leadership in controlling a crisis without precedent.The WHO mission comes with heavy political baggage — China refused the team access until mid-January and there are question marks over what the experts can hope to find a year after the virus first emerged.On Friday, the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan sought to manage expectations.Success “is not measured necessarily in absolutely finding a source on the first mission”, he told a press conference in Geneva.“This is a complicated business, but what we need to do is gather all of the data… and come to an assessment as to how much more we know about the origins of the disease and what further studies may be needed to elucidate that.”Last week, China warned the United States against “political interference” during the trip, after the White House demanded a “robust and clear” investigation.The WHO insists the probe will stick tightly to the science behind how the virus jumped from animals — believed to be bats — to humans.The team is also expected to visit the market believed to have seen the first major cluster of infections, as well as the Wuhan Institute of Virology and other labs, in what the WHO’s Ryan described as a “very busy, busy schedule”. Beijing is desperate to defang criticism of its handling of the chaotic early stages of the outbreak.It has refocused attention at home — and abroad — on its handling of and recovery from the outbreak.Since seeping beyond China’s borders, the pandemic has ripped across the world, killing more than two million people and wrecking economies.China, with a relatively low reported death toll of 4,636, has bounced back, and has swiftly locked down areas where cases have been found, tested millions and restricted travel to snuff out the crisis.The country’s economy grew by 2.3 percent despite the outbreak last year and its leadership misses few chances to boast of the country’s resilience and renewal.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman on Friday flagged the WHO visit as “a part of global research” into the pandemic.“It is not an investigation,” Zhao Lijian told reporters."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/eu-approves-astrazeneca-jab-as-worries-grow-over-virus-strains/,hospital in Wuhan,1,"The European Union on Friday approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine for use on all adults, as concerns grow around the world over the effectiveness of different jabs against new strains of Covid-19.Brussels’ announcement after a green light from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) marks the third vaccine approved for use in the EU, following the jabs made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.The pharma giant’s chief executive Pascal Soriot said approval “underscores the value of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine”, noting it is “easy to administer” — with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna alternatives requiring storage at ultra-low temperatures.But even as she announced the approval, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen referred indirectly to a mounting row with AstraZeneca over deliveries of the shots.“I expect the company to deliver the 400 million doses as agreed,” von der Leyen tweeted. The British-Swedish company has admitted it will only be able to deliver a fraction of the doses promised to the EU in the short term due to production problems.That has come as a huge blow to Europe’s already struggling rollout, while setting the EU on a collision course with former member Britain as they jostle for AstraZeneca’s limited supplies.In a sign of the growing tensions, the EU on Friday released a redacted version of its contract with AstraZeneca, while announcing a mechanism that could allow it to deny the export of vaccines made on European soil.World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom reiterated a warning against “vaccine nationalism”, saying there is “real danger that the very tools that could help to end the pandemic -– vaccines –- may exacerbate” global inequality.There is also controversy over the jab within the EU itself, with the EMA saying it was suitable for adults of all ages.But Germany’s vaccines panel on Friday upheld advice it should not be used on over-65s due to insufficient evidence that it works.French President Emmanuel Macron also said the AstraZeneca shot appeared “quasi-ineffective” for that age group, while leaving any final decision on its use in the country to health authorities.Beyond Europe, scientists are concerned that the coronavirus variant first detected in South Africa may elude some vaccines — a potential stumbling block to the global strategy of taming Covid-19 through mass inoculation. With the global death toll close to 2.2 million, the fight against the pandemic has been further complicated by the emergence of more contagious variants first detected in Britain and Brazil as well as South Africa.Mozambique’s President Filipe Nyusi has warned that hospitals across southern Africa are “rapidly reaching the limit of their capacities”, in part down to the new variant.New data on Thursday and Friday showed average effectiveness of 89.3 and 66 percent for shots from American biotech firm Novavax and Johnson & Johnson.But while Novavax’s jab was highly effective against the British variant, both were less effective against the South African strain.Johnson & Johnson is quickly expected to apply for a US emergency authorisation, and the EMA said it expected an application for use in the EU “shortly”.Pfizer and Moderna have said their vaccines are effective against the variants.Citing concerns over the new strains, Germany on Friday said it would ban travel from countries where the variants are prevalent starting this weekend, while Canada announced hotel quarantine for all new arrivals.“Now is just not the time to be flying,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said after airlines agreed to cancel flights to sunbelt destinations until the end of April.In the EU, Hungary became the first member state to approve the Chinese-made Sinopharm vaccine, saying it had agreed to buy five million doses.The Chinese “know the most” about Covid-19, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said, adding: “When I choose, I will want the Chinese vaccine.” Until governments achieve widespread immunity through vaccinations, restrictions such as lockdowns remain among the few options available — but they are deeply unpopular among many.In France, Prime Minister Jean Castex’s office told AFP he would announce new restrictions after days of speculation about a third lockdown.Africa’s largest film festival, the Pan-African Festival of Cinema and Television of Ouagadougou, known by its acronym in French of FESPACO, has also had to be postponed due to the pandemic, Burkina Faso’s government said.And in sport, the Oman Open golf tournament was postponed along with all other sporting events.But there was good news for New Yorkers as Governor Andrew Cuomo said indoor dining could resume at 25 percent capacity from February 14, just in time for Valentine’s Day.In Japan, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has shrugged off growing doubts over the fate of the Tokyo Olympics — scheduled to start on July 23 — insisting they will go ahead as “proof of mankind’s victory over the virus and as a symbol of global unity”."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/jj-single-dose-covid-vaccine-has-66-overall-efficacy-but-less-against-s-africa-variant/,EU approves AstraZeneca jab as worries grow over virus strains,1,"Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose Covid-19 vaccine has an overall efficacy of 66 percent, the company said Friday after a huge multi-continent trial, but the shot does not protect as well against a variant first detected in South Africa.Encouragingly, the vaccine was able to prevent 85 percent of severe Covid-19 cases across all geographical regions however — a key indicator lauded by experts.Its effectiveness against all forms of the disease — mild, moderate and severe — was as high as 72 percent in the United States, but fell to 57 percent in South Africa, where a more transmissible new variant is dominant. In Latin America it was 66 percent effective.“We’re proud to have reached this critical milestone and our commitment to address this global health crisis continues with urgency for everyone, everywhere,” the company’s CEO Alex Gorsky said.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden was “encouraged” by the data and the Food and Drug Administration would carry out its own evaluation.J&J said it would apply for US emergency authorization in early February, and the vaccine will then likely become the third available in the world’s hardest-hit country.The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were the first to be authorized in the US, and both have efficacies of around 95 percent.While the J&J vaccine is not as protective, the comparisons are not quite like-for-like, because those trials reported results before newer, more transmissible mutations of the virus became dominant in some parts of the world.These variants, such as B.1.135 in South Africa and P.1 in Brazil, elude some of the blocking action of antibodies triggered by vaccines made against the common strain of the coronavirus.But the J&J vaccine requires only one shot, and can be stored for up to three months at 36-46 Fahrenheit (2-8 degrees Celsius), giving it a logistical edge over the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.“The fact we have a single-dose vaccine that’s 66 percent effective, and highly effective against severe disease, is still a success,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, adding it would increase US vaccination capacity.“The real headline result is that a single shot vaccine, capable of easy long-term storage and administration provided complete protection against hospitalization and death,” added Kevin Marsh, a professor of tropical medicine at the University of Oxford.J&J says that if authorized it is on track to deliver 100 million doses to the US by the end of June. The J&J shot uses a genetically-engineered version of a common-cold causing adenovirus as a “vector” to shuttle genetic instructions into human cells, telling them to create a protein of the coronavirus.This in turn evokes an immune response, and the same technology — known as an adenovirus vector vaccine — has been used in the company’s European Commission-approved Ebola vaccine.The J&J vaccine uses double-stranded DNA molecules to deliver its genetic instructions, which are hardier than the single-stranded RNA molecules used in Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, and eases the cold storage requirements.Vector vaccines also have downsides: the human body can develop an immune response to the vector, attacking it and reducing the efficacy, particularly of booster shots.This was a weakness of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which uses the same technology but comes in two doses. The Phase 3 J&J trial was conducted in eight countries, involving 43,783 people, 34 percent of whom were over 60.This broke down to 19,302 in the US, 17,905 in Latin America and 6,575 in South Africa.The differences in its efficacy across these regions further emphasizes the growing threat posed by new variants.Anthony Fauci, the US top infectious disease official, said it highlighted the need to step up the vaccination rate quickly before new variants establish themselves firmly in the US, and to quickly develop new vaccines directed at variants.“The fundamental principle of getting people vaccinated as quickly and as efficiently as you possibly can will always be the best way to prevent the further evolution of any mutant,” he told reporters."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-demands-robust-virus-origin-probe-as-pandemic-surges-worldwide/,but less against S. Africa variant,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The United States demanded a “robust and clear” international probe into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, as a team of World Health Organization experts in China waited Thursday for the green light to begin its long-awaited Covid-19 probe.The call came as coronavirus infections shot past 100 million and governments scrambled to get their hands on scarce vaccine doses, with a bitter row erupting between the European Union and Britain over the supply of AstraZeneca shots.Beijing has so far frustrated international efforts to track the origins of the virus, which has killed more than 2.1 million people globally, and only recently allowed the WHO team into China after repeated delays.“It’s imperative that we get to the bottom of the early days of the pandemic in China, and we’ve been supportive of an international investigation that we feel should be robust and clear,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday.President Joe Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump had enraged China by accusing it of a botched response to the initial outbreak in Wuhan, and had led calls for an independent investigation.China has sought to deflect blame for the massive global human and economic toll by suggesting — without proof — that the virus emerged somewhere else.The highly anticipated WHO mission was expected to begin its work under tight security on Thursday as team members finished their 14-day quarantine after arriving in China.But relatives of those who died in Wuhan have accused Chinese authorities of deleting their social media group and putting pressure on them to keep quiet, apparently to avoid any embarrassment during the WHO probe. The pandemic has surged despite many nations kicking off mass vaccination programs, and one major issue in recent weeks has been of demand for jabs far outstripping supply.With cases surging across Europe, the EU has demanded that AstraZeneca make up for delays by supplying doses from its factories in the UK.But Britain has told the firm to honor its delivery promises too as it tries to accelerate its program, even using historic sites such as the Salisbury Cathedral and Lord’s cricket ground as vaccination centers.AstraZeneca has said there is simply not enough to go around.At least 90 million doses of that vaccine, which AstraZeneca developed with the University of Oxford, will be produced in Japan, government spokesman Katsunobu Kato said Thursday, but local media said they may not be distributed until May.Pfizer, which developed its successful vaccine with BioNTech, has revised higher its production target for this year from 1.3 billion doses to 2 billion.While part of that is down to increased production, it is also impacted by a change in how the firm counts doses — after initially saying each vial contained five, the pharma giant now says six shots can be extracted. Vaccines are considered critical to eventually defeating Covid-19, which has continued to re-emerge even in nations where it was brought under control.New Zealand confirmed two new cases of the more virulent South African coronavirus strain on Thursday, days after an initial case that ended a run of more than two months without any community transmission.The Pacific nation topped a list published Thursday by the Lowy Institute, a top Australian think tank, assessing almost 100 countries on how they managed the pandemic.Brazil was ranked the worst, at number 98, with Mexico, Colombia, Iran and the United States also near the bottom.Vietnam, which made the top 10, on Thursday reported its first community transmission in nearly two months.The lack of success globally in containing the pandemic sparked doubts about whether the delayed Tokyo Olympics can be held at all this year.But the head of the International Olympic Committee insisted organizers were focused on how — not if — the Games will be held.“Our task is to organize Olympic Games, not to cancel Olympic Games,” said Thomas Bach.“And that is why we will not add fuel to this speculation.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/s-africa-president-blasts-vaccine-hoarding-at-davos-forum/,Pfizer vaccine not linked to post-jab deaths: EU regulator,1,", South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday lashed “vaccine nationalism,” accusing rich countries of bulk-buying coronavirus vaccines and hoarding them to the detriment of others.Addressing the all-virtual 2021 World Economic Forum (WEF), Ramaphosa said low- and middle-income countries were being shouldered aside by wealthier nations able to acquire “up to four times what their population needs”.“We are concerned about vaccine nationalism,” he warned.“Rich countries in the world are holding on to these vaccines and we are saying: release the excess vaccines that you have ordered and hoarded.”Ramaphosa’s comments coincides with growing concerns that bilateral deals between wealthier governments and coronavirus vaccine manufacturers could hike prices and limit supply in some regions.The World Health Organization (WHO) had already warned against “vaccine nationalism” and “price gouging” last year, before a successful jab was found.WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus this month told rich countries not to “cut the queue” and called on those which had ordered excess doses to hand them over to its Covax vaccine-sharing facility.South Africa, the continent’s worst-affected nation, is already paying two and a half times more for Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine than European Union members, its health ministry said last week.EU says it has invested heavily in the vaccine, taking the risk of funding its development and pre-production at a time when there was no guarantee that it would be effective.A first batch of at least 1.5 million doses ordered from the Serum Institute of India is expected to arrive in South Africa this month.That eagerly-awaited shipment will mark the start of its inoculation campaign, which aims to vaccinate two thirds of a 60 million-strong population by the end of 2021.A total of 20 million doses have been ordered so far.Covax is expected to provide shots for 10 percent of the population later this year, while other vaccines will be supplied via the African Union (AU) and bilateral contracts with manufacturers that have not yet been disclosed.But Ramaphosa said pooling initiatives such as the AU-led African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT) had only been “marginally successful”.He urged vaccine hoarders to make excess doses directly available to their less wealthy counterparts and back this with financial assistance.“We want vaccines as quickly as other countries do,” Ramaphosa added.“Coronavirus… affects all of us equally. Therefore our remedies, our actions to combat it must also be equal.”While reported coronavirus cases have remained comparatively low in Africa, many countries are battling with second infection waves often more viscous than their first.More infectious virus variants, including one discovered in South Africa, have meanwhile accelerated the global vaccine scramble.AVATT, established by Ramaphosa himself as AU chair, has committed to buying a provisional 270 million vaccine doses for African countries.Covax is aiming to deliver 600 million shots to the continent.It is estimated Africa will need 1.5 billion vaccine doses to immunise 60 percent of its 1.3 billion inhabitants, costing between $7 and $10 billion.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/czech-trainers-teach-dogs-to-sniff-out-covid/,S.Africa president blasts vaccine hoarding at Davos forum,1,"In a dog training centre built inside a shipping container located in a Czech mountain village, Renda, Cap and Laky are being put to the test.They sniff at six vessels, each containing a piece of cloth with scent from patients with Covid-19, negative donors, or fake samples.“Good boy!” exclaims Lenka Vlachova, a trainer working at Prague’s fire brigade, as jagdterrier Renda sits down by one sample, wagging his tail.The team of dog trainers are working in their own time and report a 95-percent success rate in Covid-19 detection in samples of human scent.“The study is designed to verify dogs’ ability to detect Covid-19 and generate a method enabling the use of trained dogs in combatting the pandemic,” project head Gustav Hotovy told AFP.“The method should also work with other diseases, even more lethal than Covid-19,” Hotovy said.“In the end, we should be able to detect a huge number of people in a very short time with a trained dog,” he said, speaking in the snowy village of Kliny near the German border.Vlachova told AFP the first study confirming dogs are able to detect tissue attacked by a virus was conducted in the United States about a decade ago.“The virus changes the human tissue, affecting the scent signature of the person,” she said.Hotovy, a retired cynologist whose team started training the dogs last August, said that the signature changes “so much that it is immediately discernible for the dogs”. The samples used are obtained merely by rubbing a piece of cotton against the patient’s skin.The team then has to ensure the sample is virus-free to prevent the dogs from catching the disease.Using the same sampling method, a Finnish team has been using dogs for testing at Helsinki airport, reporting its dogs can detect the virus with close to 100 percent accuracy.Vlachova said the Czechs would like to work together with the Finns or with French and German teams working on similar projects.Unlike their western peers, the Czech team works in its free time and relies on scant financial means provided by a local dog food maker. Cynologist Katerina Jancarikova said the virus-affected tissue made up “just a tiny fragment in the overall scent, a part of the dogs’ puzzle”.“It’s like looking for Wally,” she said, referring to the popular children’s books in which a tiny character in red and white stripes has to be found in pictures of a huge crowd.Jancarikova said any dog can be trained for detection as long as it is cooperative.As Vlachova led Renda back to the van, Hotovy walked into the training centre with a sturdy giant schnauzer named Laky who eagerly sniffed at the vessels, placed in a different pattern, before easily identifying the positive one.“He was once reluctant to cooperate,” he chuckled, adding that the dogs showed the same eager response when let loose in a nearby house where a guest who tested positive for Covid-19 had been staying.“They immediately jumped at his bed with the same happy reaction they show over a positive sample in the centre,” he said. © Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/no-europe-deaths-directly-tied-to-covid-vaccines-experts/,Air pollution linked to irreversible sight loss: study,1,"PARIS France (AFP) — Despite dozens of deaths of people shortly after they were vaccinated against coronavirus, scientists say the evidence available so far does not incriminate the new anti-Covid vaccines.Health agencies stress however that the vast majority of post-vaccination fatalities were elderly, already vulnerable and often sick.Here’s a review of the situation: Norway sparked alarm last week when it reported the deaths of 33 of some 20,000 retirement home residents who had received a first shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.At least 13 of the fatalities were not only very elderly but also considered frail with serious ailments, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said.While it noted that no analysis had yet been carried out on the causes of the deaths, it suggested that with the aged and vulnerable the normal side effects of vaccination such as fever or nausea could have contributed.Outside Norway the news raised widespread concern and fed anti-vaccine skepticism, prompting the authorities to stress that no link had been established between the vaccine and post-jab deaths.In France, of 800,000 people vaccinated, nine deaths of chronically ill residents of care and retirement homes were recorded by Friday.The national medicines agency ANSM said that based on available evidence, “Nothing leads to the conclusion that the reported deaths were linked to vaccination.”Other examples include 13 deaths of elderly people recorded in Sweden and seven in Iceland, all with no link established.In Portugal, a care worker died two days after being inoculated but the justice ministry said a post-mortem found no direct link.France’s interior ministry on January 18 listed 71 “observations of death” in Europe of people who had the inoculation, but offered no further details. The European Medicines Agency said that despite the deaths, “to date no specific concerns have been identified with Comirnaty”, the commercial name for the Pfizer shot.The EMA noted that the authorities investigate fatalities to determine whether the vaccine was responsible.National and European agencies check any problems with vaccinations reported by health professionals, pharmaceutical firms and patients themselves.For the moment, the number and type of deaths among those vaccinated are not considered abnormal, with no cause-and-effect relationship identified.In many countries — such as France, Norway, Britain and Spain — the frail and elderly are first in line for vaccinations.“It is not unexpected that some of these people may naturally fall ill due to their age or underlying conditions shortly after being vaccinated, without the vaccine playing any role in that,” the UK medicines regulator MHRA said. The deaths are a highly sensitive issue, and approaches to informing the public vary.France and some Nordic countries have reported post-vaccination deaths and detailed the potential side effects of the jabs even if no link has been established.But Britain’s MHRA said it would make a statement at a later date, possibly seeking to avoid spreading alarm.“We will publish details of all suspected reactions reported in association with approved Covid-19 vaccines, along with our assessment of the data on a regular basis in the future,” it said.In any event, European health officials say the deaths do not call into question the safety of the vaccines.Norway has not changed its vaccination rollout, even if it has recommended doctors consider the overall health of the most frail before giving them the jab, the policy of numerous other countries.Globally, more than 60 million doses have been received in at least 64 countries or territories, according to an AFP tally on Saturday."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/canadian-study-says-oral-medicine-effective-in-treating-covid-19/,Czech trainers teach dogs to sniff out Covid,1,"MONTREAL, Canada (AFP) — A major clinical trial shows that an inflammatory drug called colchicine is effective in treating Covid-19 and reduces the risk of complications from the disease, doctors in Canada said.The results of the study are a “major scientific discovery” and make colchicine — a medicine used to treat gout — “the world’s first oral drug that could be used to treat non-hospitalized patients with Covid-19,” the Montreal Heart Institute said in a statement late Friday.The study results show that colchicine reduced by 21 percent the risk of death or hospitalizations in patients with Covid-19 compared to placebo, the institute said.The study was carried out in Canada, the US, Europe and South America among a population of 4,488 patients.In 4,159 of these patients, in whom the diagnosis of Covid-19 was proven by a naso-pharyngeal PCR test, use of colchicine reduced hospitalizations by 25 percent, the need for mechanical ventilation by 50 percent, and deaths by 44 percent, the study concluded.Colchicine is effective in preventing dangerous inflammatory syndromes called “cytokine storms” and reducing complications associated with Covid-19, said Dr Jean-Claude Tardif, director of the MHI Research Center and principal investigator in this study.“We are pleased to offer the first oral medication in the world whose use could have a significant impact on public health and potentially prevent Covid-19 complications for millions of patients,” Tardif said.The study was conducted among Covid-19 patients not hospitalized at the time of enrollment in the trial, and with at least one risk factor for Covid-19 complications.“This is the world’s largest study testing an orally administered drug in non-hospitalized patients with Covid-19,” the heart institute said. © Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/inside-the-worlds-biggest-vaccine-factory-indias-serum-institute/,Inside the world’s biggest vaccine factory,1,"PUNE, India (AFP) — The tiny clinking vials supervised by silent PPE-wearing technicians belie the excitement inside the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India, a major player in the fight against coronavirus.The firm, founded in 1966 in the western city of Pune, is producing millions of doses of the Covishield vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, for India and much of the developing world.Unlike the rival Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Covishield can be stored and transported using standard refrigeration.It is also significantly cheaper than the vaccines developed by Pfizer or the US firm Moderna, making it better suited for countries with poorer populations and rusty infrastructure. Even before the pandemic, the Indian firm was a world leader in vaccines, producing 1.5 billion doses a year and inoculating two out of three children in 170 countries against diseases such as polio, mumps, meningitis and measles.Its journey kicked off on a stud farm, where the firm’s owners, the Poonawalla family, began breeding horses in 1946, before a conversation with a vet sparked the realisation that anti-toxin serum extracted from the animals could be used to make vaccines.The Serum Institute soon became a market leader thanks to its cheap and effective drugs, which were eagerly sought after by price-conscious governments and consumers, prompting the company to expand at a dizzying rate.Adar Poonawalla, its 40-year-old CEO, has spent nearly a billion dollars in recent years enlarging and improving the sprawling Pune campus.As a result, when the coronavirus pandemic began to sweep across the world, the company, which recorded annual revenues of over $800 million in 2019-20 and is debt-free, was in pole position to reap the rewards. The palm-fringed Pune campus, whose grounds boast horse-shaped topiaries in a playful nod to the firm’s origins, is home to several buildings where vaccines are manufactured and scrutinised for quality before being deposited into sterilised vials and stored for delivery.From Brazil to South Africa, there is no shortage of customers, with governments clamouring to buy Covishield.With Poonawalla vowing to reserve 50 percent of Covishield stocks for the Indian market, New Delhi, which intends to immunise 300 million people by July, is engaging in a bout of vaccine diplomacy, planning to supply 20 million doses to its South Asian neighbours.The Serum Institute also plans to supply 200 million doses to Covax, a World Health Organization-backed effort to procure and distribute inoculations to poor countries.If all this sounds overwhelming, the firm’s bosses are not worried.“ We are used to these kinds of pressures because even in the past there were situations when we were required to step up the production to meet individual countries’ requirements,” Suresh Jadhav, Serum Institute’s executive director, told AFP.Even a deadly fire at an under-construction building this week failed to dent confidence, with Poonawalla promptly tweeting that “there would be no loss of #COVISHIELD production due to multiple production buildings that I had kept in reserve to deal with such contingencies”.The pandemic has transformed Poonawalla’s public profile, from a jet-setting billionaire known for his expensive taste in cars and fine art to a pharma-tycoon applauded for his willingness to take risks and his commitment to affordable vaccines.Unsurprisingly, the father-of-two has not held back from taking so-called anti-vaxxers to task, including berating US rapper Kanye West for spreading conspiracy theories.“Though we enjoy your music very much @KanyeWest, your views on #vaccines come across as irresponsible and borderline dangerous, considering the influence you have today and may have in the future; vaccines save lives,” Poonawalla tweeted in July."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pfizer-offers-40-mn-covid-shots-to-poorer-countries-at-cost/,India’s Serum Institute,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — Pfizer announced Friday that it will provide up to 40 million of its Covid-19 vaccine doses to poorer countries on a non-profit basis, through the globally-pooled Covax facility.While dozens of the world’s richer countries have begun their vaccination campaigns in a bid to curb the pandemic, coronavirus jabs have been few and far between in the world’s poorer nations.Covax — the globally-pooled coronavirus vaccine procurement and equitable distribution effort, aimed at ensuring that lower-income countries get hold of doses too — is hoping to ship its first deliveries in February.Covax is co-led by the World Health Organization and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the only one so far to have received emergency use approval from the WHO.Developing countries should have “the same access to vaccines as the rest of the world”, Pfizer chairman Albert Bourla told a virtual press conference.“We will provide the vaccine to Covax for these countries at a not-for-profit basis.“We are proud to have this opportunity to provide doses that will support Covax’s efforts towards vaccinating health care workers at high risk of exposure in developing countries, and other vulnerable populations.” Set up last year, Covax initially aimed to secure enough Covid-19 vaccines this year for the most vulnerable 20 percent in participating countries.In Covax, funding is covered through donations for the 92 lower- and lower-middle income economies involved, while for richer countries, buying in operates as a back-up insurance policy.Gavi chief executive Seth Berkley said nearly 150 million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine were ready to ship through Covax — pending emergency use approval from the WHO, which is on course to happen in mid-February.He said Covax should be able to deliver those doses in the first quarter of 2021.Covax still needs to finalise a supply agreement for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.Berkley said Covax could procure 2.3 billion vaccine doses this year, which, he said, would equate to close to 1.8 billion doses for the poorest 92 countries — enough to vaccinate about 27 percent of the population, an upgrade on the initial target. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said vaccines were offering the hope of ending the pandemic and repairing the global economy.However, “to do that, we need every member state, every partner, and every vaccine producer on board”.Speaking more broadly than Covax, Pfizer’s Bourla said he felt confident that Pfizer-BioNTech could produce two billion Covid-19 vaccine doses by the end of 2021.“Science will win, and will win for everyone,” he said.Asked about how many vaccine doses all manufacturers might be able to produce this year, Gavi’s Berkley said: “I think we’re talking about numbers in the range of six to seven billion doses”.Doctors Without Borders said the 40 million doses offered to Covax by Pfizer were a drop in the ocean and a lamentable “pittance” compared to the direct deals it has struck with high-income countries.“We call on pharmaceutical corporations like Pfizer and its peers to supply the Covax facility with the volumes it needs at an at-cost price,” the medical charity’s Dana Gill said in a statement.“If the world is going to emerge from this pandemic, we absolutely must distribute these vaccines equitably, not based upon who can pay the most.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-seeks-review-of-reports-on-deaths-in-frail-elderly-people-who-got-pfizer-vaccine/,Pfizer offers 40 mn Covid shots to poorer countries at cost,1,"(Eagle News) – The World Health Organization (WHO) is seeking a review of the reports on deaths in frail elderly individuals who had received the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.In a statement on Friday, Jan. 22, WHO said that the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) has already met early this week for the review.The GACVS is a group of experts that provides independent and authoritative guidance to WHO on the matter of safe vaccine use.“The GACVS COVID-19 Vaccine Safety subcommittee met virtually on Tuesday, 19 January 2021, to review available information and data on deaths reported in frail, elderly individuals who had received the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2 (hereafter, BNT162b2),” a WHO release said.“Experts invited from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Uppsala Monitoring Center (UMC) provided an overview of deaths reported in Europe and in the WHO global database (VigiBase) following vaccination with BNT162b2,” it said.WHO said that based on a “careful scientific review of the information made available” the subcommittee made several conclusions, one of which was that Pfizer vaccine use remains “favorable” in the elderly.It also found no contributory role for the vaccine use in the elderly deaths.“The current reports do not suggest any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities in frail, elderly individuals or any unusual characteristics of adverse events following administration of BNT162b2,” it said.“Reports are in line with the expected, all-cause mortality rates and causes of death in the sub-population of frail, elderly individuals, and the available information does not confirm a contributory role for the vaccine in the reported fatal events,” the report said.Because of this, it said that the committee “considers that the benefit-risk balance of BNT162b2 remains favorable in the elderly, and does not suggest any revision, at present, to the recommendations around the safety of this vaccine.”Still, WHO said that there should be continuous monitoring of vaccine safety in various countries and that information in case of adverse events should be collected and reviewed as the COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out globally.The GACVS COVID-19 Vaccine Safety subcommittee recommended that “data on suspected adverse events should be collected and reviewed continuously – nationally, regionally, and globally”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/in-tracking-virus-mutations-most-countries-flying-blind/,WHO seeks review of reports on deaths in frail,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — To monitor changes to the coronavirus that could supercharge the pandemic or render vaccines less effective, scientists must sequence its genetic code to catalogue potentially dangerous mutations as they emerge.But so few countries are conducting and sharing surveillance that experts are as worried about the mutations they cannot see as those they can.Publication of the first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 in January last year, at the very outset of the pandemic, allowed scientists to identify it as a new coronavirus, and begin developing diagnostic testing and vaccines.Since then, tens of thousands of sequences have been uploaded on public databases, enabling mutations to be tracked with a degree of detail and a speed never achieved before.But the lion’s share of this information has come from just one country: Britain.As of mid-January, GISAID — a major data sharing platform originally created to monitor influenza — had received 379,000 sequences.Of these, 166,000 were from Britain’s Covid-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK), a partnership between health authorities and academic institutions.“This is the first time we are ever seeing how a pathogen evolves at this scale,” said Ewan Harrison, Director of Strategy and Transformation at COG-UK and a fellow at the Wellcome Sanger Institute where much of the sequencing is being done.“We are learning that these mutations accrue way faster than we thought.”Currently the programme is sequencing 10,000 genomes a week — roughly six percent of known cases in Britain although that fluctuates — and the plan is to double that.“The UK blows everyone else out of the water,” said Emma Hodcroft, an epidemiologist at the University of Bern and co-developer on the Nextstrain virus tracking project.“To me, this has been the moonshot of the pandemic, alongside the vaccines.”Denmark, she noted, also routinely sequences and shares data, but the information coming from most other countries is sporadic at best.Sequencing has identified distinct variants — strains that have acquired clusters of new mutations — in Britain, South Africa and Brazil in recent weeks.The new, fast-spreading variant in the UK is “like a mini-pandemic within the pandemic”, said Harrison.But without systematic monitoring, he added, scientists might still not have figured out it was a “game changer”.Early warning did not stop the variant spreading — it has been detected in dozens of countries. But it has allowed other nations to prepare.Without the warning from UK scientists, the world would probably be flying blind, said Hodcroft.“If this was expanding in another country, we would just be looking at whatever country it was and going: ‘Oh, they’re having a bad rise in cases, I guess people aren’t following the guidelines’,” she told AFP.Other variants have become visible only when they spread internationally from their point of origin.Earlier this month, for example, a new strain — carrying a mutation, known as E484K, that researchers fear could evade immunity — was identified in Japan in people arriving from Brazil. The World Health Organization has said better sequencing capacity is a worldwide priority.Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s Covid-19 technical lead, recently described the number of sequences shared so far as “astounding”, but said they were coming from just handful of countries.“Improving the geographic coverage of sequencing is critical for the world to have eyes and ears on changes to the virus,” she told an online forum.New WHO guidance said a “revolution” in virus genomic investigation has helped build a better understanding of everything from Ebola to influenza.And now, it said: “For the first time, genomic sequencing can help to guide the public health response to a pandemic in near-real time.”When another coronavirus, SARS, began spreading in 2002, only three genome variants were publicly shared in the first month, and 31 by month three.This time, six genomes were available to researchers worldwide a few weeks after the virus emerged. Within six months there were 60,000 variants published.Initially the new coronavirus did not show much genetic diversity, said Hodcroft, even as it “exploded across Europe” due mainly to widespread travel.But that lack of mutation was an important clue in itself.“We were able to see that it really did seem to originate in China, because all the other sequences that were detected around the world nested within the diversity of the Chinese sequences,” she told AFP.During the summer of 2020 new strains emerged, displacing the earlier incarnations of the virus. Mutations are to be expected in viral evolution and occur when a pathogen infects someone and sets about replicating itself.Most of these new strains confer no advantage to the virus, and some are even detrimental. But occasionally a mutation increases infectiousness or causes more severe illness.SARS-CoV-2 picks up changes at a slower rate than some other viruses, like HIV or influenza. But the more people a virus infects, the greater the opportunity for mutation.This becomes even more likely in someone with a chronic illness — an extended exposure to a weakened immune system gives the virus more time to rack up multiple mutations.Harrison said this may be how the new variant emerged in the UK, and researchers are now sequencing tests from immunocompromised patients, as well as people whose vaccine failed. Systematic, countrywide sequencing has given researchers new insights into viral transmission.In one case, it helped identify a minibus as the culprit in a hospital outbreak.On a wider scale, an analysis of tens of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, published in Science this month, found that abundant travel and virus imports to the UK at the beginning of the epidemic seeded more than a thousand transmission lineages.The next step is testing how different mutations affect transmission, disease severity, and vaccine effectiveness, and predicting as quickly as possible how a new variant might behave.The WHO has said global sequencing will help “better understand the world of emerging pathogens and their interactions with humans and animals in a variety of climates, ecosystems, cultures, lifestyles and biomes”.“This knowledge will shape a new vision of the world and open new paradigms in epidemic and pandemic prevention and control.”But sequencing at scale is logistically complex.“There were weeks when things didn’t work properly, because you’re building the systems from scratch at pace, mid-pandemic,” Harrison said.The Sanger Institute stores the tens of thousands of samples it receives every day in huge shipping container freezers and had to build robotics infrastructure to help sort through them.Legal concerns meant COG-UK decided to share minimal information on the sequences in order to make them public, Harrison said. The issue was a hurdle for other countries, particularly those reliant on private healthcare providers retaining ownership of data.Costs are also a challenge in many parts of the world, but Hodcroft said richer nations like the United States and those in Europe have no excuse.“There is no reason we don’t have coordinated sequencing responses, except… that we haven’t decided to do it,” she said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covax-the-global-plan-to-share-covid-vaccines/,elderly people who got Pfizer vaccine,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The Covax programme, bolstered by the new US presidency on Thursday, aims to secure enough Covid-19 vaccines this year for the most vulnerable 20 percent in every country, rich or poor.Top US government scientist Anthony Fauci told the World Health Organization (WHO) that the United States intends to join Covax, the globally-pooled coronavirus vaccine procurement and equitable distribution effort.The move should give the facility a much-needed powerful impetus — amid fears that rich countries are undermining the project by cutting their own direct deals with manufacturers.Since December, dozens of the world’s wealthiest countries have begun vaccination campaigns in a bid to halt the coronavirus pandemic.As members of the Covax facility, the poorest nations are hoping to see their very first doses arrive in February.In Covax, funding is covered for the 92 lower- and lower-middle income economies involved, while for richer countries, it operates as a back-up insurance policy.Aimed at pooling the risk and rewards, Covax has struck agreements with manufacturers for two billion vaccine doses, and has secured options on a further billion. The Covax facility was launched in June 2020 at the Global Vaccine Summit.It is co-led by the WHO as well as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.It sought an immediate $2 billion to kick-start the programme, with the intention of ensuring poorer nations can vaccinate their health workers and most vulnerable citizens — on the basis that the pandemic would remain a global threat if it was not tackled worldwide.Currently, around 190 countries are participating, including the 92 low-income and lower-middle income nations such as India, Nigeria, Pakistan and Vietnam.Covax is inspired by similar previous mechanisms that facilitated universal and equitable access to pneumococcal and Ebola vaccines.It guarantees the purchase of a fixed volume of Covid-19 vaccines even before they have been approved for use, and offers market guarantees.Covax thereby aims to give pharmaceutical companies the confidence to invest in production, to ensure that vaccines are ready to go, at scale and speed, once regulators give the go-ahead. UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund, is the leader in UN vaccine logistics and is preparing to transport up to 850 tonnes of doses per month.Covax deals have been struck with several vaccine manufacturers: Novavax, Sanofi-GSK, Johnson and Johnson — which have not so far been licensed for use by any national regulator — plus AstraZeneca.So far, the WHO has only given its emergency use validation to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which has been given the green light in several countries.The WHO hopes to make a decision in late February on the Moderna vaccine, which has also been authorised by several national health authorities.The WHO is in talks with Pfizer and Moderna to procure doses. The vaccine shipments depend on several factors, including national regulatory approval and the recipient country’s preparedness to start vaccinating.The project’s success also rests on whether it can raise the required funding.Covax raised the initial $2 billion last year.But at least $4.6 billion more will be needed this year for procurement, with a further $800 million needed for research and development and $1.4 billion for vaccine delivery support.The WHO hopes to distribute 145 million doses worldwide in the first three months of this year.However, the WHO has repeatedly hit out at “vaccine nationalism” — particularly rich countries hogging the first doses off the production line in their own direct deals with manufacturers, bypassing Covax.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday that 39 million doses of coronavirus vaccines had been administered worldwide at that point, of which 25 — “not 25 million; not 25,000; just 25” — were in a lower-income country. ©"

In northwest Brazil, however, hospitals were battling dire shortages of oxygen and hospital beds.Health workers described harrowing scenes, with patients dying gasping for breath due to the lack of available oxygen.“As soon as they unload the oxygen, we start worrying where the next day’s supply will come from. It is a constant stress,” said one hospital staffer.More contagious coronavirus variants have travelled quickly around the globe — including from Brazil — tempering optimism that mass vaccination campaigns would bring a swift end to the worst phase of the pandemic.The European Centre for Disease Prevention, the EU’s disease agency, on Thursday urged countries to prepare more stringent measures and speed up vaccine campaigns in the coming weeks because of the risks posed by potent new strains.But the WHO has repeatedly warned that richer countries are hogging the vaccine — and they are paying less for their doses, after negotiating favourable deals with manufacturers.South Africa, for example, will pay 2.5 times more than most European countries for each Oxford-AstraZeneca shot, the South African health ministry has confirmed.The US provided a boost to efforts to share out vaccines across the world, however, by announcing it intends to join the Covax initiative, a pool of doses supplied by countries and companies. In Japan, questions are intensifying about the viability of hosting the Tokyo Olympic Games in six months’ time — an event which would require thousands of athletes to fly in from around the world.Olympic chief Thomas Bach said there was “no reason whatsoever” to believe the games would not go ahead, adding: “This is why there is no plan B and this is why we are fully committed to make these games safe and successful.”But many organisers of large-scale events are already grappling with the reality that the return to pre-pandemic normality may come later than previously hoped.The Swiss edition of international art fair Art Basel has been postponed from June until September, while Britain’s storied Glastonbury music festival was axed for another year.Britain is facing record daily death tolls and has rammed through the approval of several vaccines, betting heavily on the jabs as an ultimate solution to the contagion.But the same urgency is not being felt everywhere.The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan plans to vaccinate its entire population, but not until after March 13 because the period before has been deemed “inauspicious”.The shots will start after that, the prime minister’s office said, adding that it was “important we roll out the nationwide vaccination on an auspicious date”."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/immune-system-remembers-coronavirus-for-at-least-6-months-study/,US resumes WHO support,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — People may be able to fight off reinfection for at least six months after they recover from Covid-19 thanks to cells that can “remember” the virus, according to research published Monday.Researchers in the United States and Switzerland studied dozens of people who had recovered from Covid-19 and found that while their antibodies may fade over time, they maintained levels of specific memory B cells.These cells can remember the pathogen and can, if faced with reinfection, prompt the immune system to reinitiate the production of virus-fighting antibodies.“Memory responses are responsible for protection from reinfection and are essential for effective vaccination,” concluded the study published in the journal Nature.“The observation that memory B cell responses do not decay after 6.2 months, but instead continue to evolve, is strongly suggestive that individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 could mount a rapid and effective response to the virus upon re-exposure.”The authors assessed 87 people with a confirmed Covid-19 diagnosis at a little over one month and six months after infection.While they found that virus-neutralizing antibody activity decreased with time, the number of memory B cells remained unchanged.Researchers said their study indicated that the memory B cell response against the coronavirus evolves during the six months after infection in the presence of viral remnant proteins in the body — enabling the cells to produce more potent antibodies.How long people can fight off reinfection to the new coronavirus and what immune process is involved are key to predicting the dynamics of the pandemic.Previous research has caused concern by showing that neutralizing antibodies can decline quickly after infection with SARS-CoV-2.But more recent studies have highlighted the role of other parts of the immune system in longer-term immunity.One paper published in the journal Science this month suggested that nearly all major parts of the immune system that can learn to recognize and repel a new pathogen could continue to respond to the virus for at least eight months.This included protein spike specific memory B cells, which the researchers found actually increased in the blood six months after infection.The paper was based on analyses of blood samples from 188 Covid-19 patients.© Agence France-Presse"

Not 25 million; not 25,000; just 25,” he said.“I need to be blunt. The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure — and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world’s poorest countries.”He said even as some countries pronounced reassuring words on equitable access, they were prioritising their own deals with manufacturers, driving up prices and trying to jump the queue.He said 44 such deals were struck in 2020 and at least 12 have already been signed since the New Year.“The situation is compounded by the fact that most manufacturers have prioritised regulatory approval in rich countries where the profits are highest, rather than submitting full dossiers to WHO,” Tedros said.“Not only does this me-first approach leave the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people at risk, it’s also self defeating.“Ultimately, these actions will only prolong the pandemic, prolong our pain, the restrictions needed to contain it, and human and economic suffering.”"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-meeting-urges-increased-virus-sequencing-to-combat-variants/,UN seeks $76 million in emergency aid for Madagascar,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization’s emergency committee called Friday for globally-ramped up coronavirus sequencing studies in order to combat troubling new variants stalking the globe.The meeting was dragged forward by two weeks for urgent talks on the emerging, seemingly more contagious strains of the virus, as the death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic topped two million, according to an AFP count.The emergency committee came out against countries requiring proof of vaccination from incoming international travellers.However, it said it was time to overhaul recommendations on travel guidance given what was now known about the virus.The WHO said it wanted Covid-19 vaccination under way in every country within the next 100 days, amid concerns that rich nations are hogging the first batches coming off the production lines.And while it sounded the alarm on a new virus variant circulating in Brazil, the WHO warned that the current infection spikes in some countries could be blamed on lapses in behaviour rather than simply the new mutations. The recently-discovered variants can only be identified by sequencing their genetic code — an analysis that is not possible everywhere.“On variants, (the committee) called for a global expansion of genomic sequencing and sharing of data, along with greater scientific collaboration to address critical unknowns,” the WHO said in a statement after the virtual meeting.The committee also called on the WHO to come up with a standardised system for naming new variants to keep them geographically and politically neutral, in a bid to avoid stigmatisation.In its epidemiological bulletin earlier this week, the WHO said the coronavirus mutation first found in Britain had spread to 50 territories, while a similar South African-identified strain has now been found in 20.A third mutation originating in the Brazilian Amazon, is currently being analysed and could impact the immune response, according to the WHO.The situation in northern Brazil’s Amazonas state, and particularly its capital Manaus, has deteriorated significantly, with hospitals pushed to the limit said WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan.“If this continues, we are going to see a wave that is greater than what was a catastrophic wave in April and May in Amazonas,” he told a press conference in Geneva.But Ryan stressed it was “too easy to just lay the blame on the variant” — saying people and authorities need to accept their share of responsibility for their actions which were driving up transmission.Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s Covid-19 technical lead, added: “This virus is dangerous on its own — variant or not.” On travel, the emergency committee recommended that countries do not require proof of vaccination from incoming travellers, given that the impact of vaccines on reducing transmission is not yet known and the availability of vaccines remains limited.Committee chairman Didier Houssin said that given the disparity of countries’ approaches to visas, quarantine and travel bans, it is “really time” for the WHO to reassess what guidance could be provided on international air, land and sea travel.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the world was at a “defining moment in the pandemic”, as he called for vaccines to be distributed equitably across the globe.Some 46 countries have started their vaccination campaigns, of which 38 are high-income nations.“I want to see vaccination under way in every country in the next 100 days so that health workers and those at high risk are protected first,” Tedros said.The first cluster of Covid-19 cases was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan in China.A WHO team of experts arrived in Wuhan on Thursday to start an investigation into the origins of the virus.“We may never find who the patient zero was,” said Van Kerkhove."

The US has 23,441,737 confirmed cases and 390,649 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.After the US, the other countries which recorded the highest total virus deaths are Brazil (207,095 deaths), India (151,918 deaths), Mexico (137,916 deaths), United Kingdom (87,448 deaths), Italy (81,325 deaths), France (70,088 deaths), Russia (63,558 deaths), Iran (56,621 deaths), and Spain (53,314 deaths)In terms of confirmed COVID-19 cases, these are the top 10 countries based on the Johns Hopkins University virus dashboard: 23,441,737 – US 10,527,683 – India 8,324,294 – Brazil 3,483,531 – Russia 3,325,636 – United Kingdom 2,930,994 – France 2,373,115 – Turkey 2,352,423 – Italy 2,252,164 – Spain 2,022,884 – GermanyThe numbers on COVID-19 cases and deaths are staggering a year after the first virus case and death was first reported in Wuhan, China.But China has largely controlled the number of COVID-19 cases a year after its first reported case. As of Jan. 16, 2021, Saturday (as of 3:22 a.m. PST) based on the John Hopkins University worldwide COVID-19 dashboard, China has dropped to the 81st place in terms of number of COVID-19 cases with a total of only 97,448 COVID-19 cases, and 4,796 deaths.Globally, cases continued to rise even amid vaccine roll-out.Ironically, the United States, India, United Kingdom, and Russia which developed vaccines against COVID-19 are also the top countries which have recorded the most total number of cases and deaths to date as new COVID-19 virus variants emerge.Ironically too, vaccines developed in China which had early on staged mass vaccinations to control virus transmission are largely mistrusted by the public based on an international survey reported by Reuters.Citing an international survey conducted by the polling company, YouGov, it said that there was higher mistrust of vaccines made in China and Russia.It was in January 2020, when scientists from China publicly released the initial data on the coronavirus genomic sequence that vaccine development efforts started worldwide."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/climate-change-worsens-child-malnutrition-study/,Climate change worsens child malnutrition: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Climate change may contribute more to greater child malnutrition and poor diet than traditional causes such as poverty and poor sanitation, according to research published on Thursday.Although childhood malnutrition has decreased globally over the past several decades, undernourishment has increased since 2015, in part due to warming temperatures and extreme weather.The United Nations says 144 million children under five were affected by stunting in 2019 as a result of chronic malnutrition, with a further 47 million suffering from wasting caused by low nutrient intake.Experts fear that the decline in essential nutrients in an increasing number of regions will challenge humanity’s ability to properly feed 10 billion people by mid-century.A team of researchers led by the University of Vermont examined diet diversity among more than 100,000 under-fives in 19 low-income countries across Asia, Africa and South America.They then combined this with 30 years of temperature and precipitation data.They found that higher temperatures were associated with significant reductions in the quality of diet in five of the six regions studied., the team warned that climate change could undo the great progress made by the world in child development.“Certainly, future climate changes have been predicted to affect malnutrition, but it surprised us that higher temperatures are already showing an impact,” said lead author Meredith Niles, assistant professor of Nutrition and Food Services at Vermont.The study looked specifically at diet diversity — a UN metric that measures diet variety and micronutrient intake.Micronutrients such as iron, folic acid and zinc, as well as vitamins A and D, are critical for physical and mental development in children.Rising carbon pollution has been shown to reduce the levels of these essential micronutrients in many crop staples, including wheat, rice and legumes.On average, children in the study had eaten ingredients from 3.2 food groups out of a possible 10 — including meat and fish, cereals and dark, leafy greens — in the previous 24 hours.In contrast, children in China were found to have eaten from more than double the number of food groups — 6.8 on average.The study found that warming temperatures and erratic weather patterns could have “profound short- and long-term impacts on child diet diversity”.Higher temperatures can directly impact the yield of globally important staple crops and reduce livestock productivity, both impacting child nutrient intake.In addition, women who are pregnant during hot spells often deliver babies with lower-than-average birth rates, putting them at additional risk of stunting.The authors called on governments to incorporate climate change into their plans for improving diets for the most vulnerable children.“That is something we find again and again in this global research,” said co-author Taylor Ricketts, director of the University of Vermont’s Gund Institute for Environment.“Continued environmental degradation has the potential to undermine the impressive global health gains of the last 50 years.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/new-virus-mutation-raises-vaccine-questions/,New virus mutation raises vaccine questions,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — As the British coronavirus variant occupies countries’ pandemic plans due to its increased transmissibility, other mutations to the Sars-CoV-2 are provoking concern among scientists who are scrambling to work out if they will still respond to vaccines.In particular, one mutation, known as E484K, detected initially in South Africa and on subsequent variants in Brazil and Japan, has raised alarm among researchers.Ravi Gupta, professor of microbiology at the University of Cambridge, said it is this mutation — and not the much-covered British variant — that is “the most worrying of all”.Although research into the new variant is limited, a Brazilian study this month looked at a patient who had recovered from Covid-19 only to become reinfected with the new, mutated strain.The paper has yet to be peer-reviewed, but the authors found that the E484K mutation could be “associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies” — meaning it could bypass the body’s natural defense memory that bestows immunity.As countries accelerate their vaccination programs, there is concern that the new mutation may render certain vaccines less effective.The Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, for example, use mRNA technology to deliver instructions to the body to produce a harmless coronavirus spike protein, which the immune system then learns to kill in anticipation of a genuine infection.With E484K, as with the British variant, the mutation occurs on the virus’ spike protein, which allows it to bind more easily with human cell receptors, potentially heightening its infectiousness.Gupta said the mutation “could be the start of problems for spike vaccines”.“They should all be effective at the moment but we worry about further mutations occurring on top of these ones,” he told AFP.Pfizer and German partner BioNTech said last week that their vaccine was effective against the N501Y mutation found on the British virus variant, known as B117.Francois Balloux, professor of Computational Systems Biology and Director of University College London’s Genetics Institute, said it was unlikely that the South African variant had mutated sufficiently to “bypass the protection provided by current vaccines”.But, he warned: “The E484K mutation has been shown to reduce antibody recognition.“As such, it helps the virus Sars-CoV-2 to bypass immune protection provided by prior infection or vaccination,” Balloux said.There have been several mutations to the novel coronavirus since it emerged in late 2019, and most have had a negligible effect on its transmissibility or severity.But the British variant has shown in several studies to be up to 70 percent more infectious than normal virus strains.And the South African variant appears to be more effective at avoiding the body’s natural response.One pre-print study in December concluded that the two new variants show that Sars-CoV-2 “has the potential to escape an effective immune response”.Researchers studied what happened to the virus when it was left in contact with plasma taken from a patient who had recovered from Covid-19.Within three months, the virus had taken on several mutations, including E484K.The authors suggested that “vaccines and antibodies able to control emerging variants should be developed.”Lead researcher Rino Rappuoli, an immunologist at pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline, told AFP that the current spike protein mutations should not pose a problem for existing vaccines, however.And even if the virus mutates to better evade immune response, vaccines should bestow at least some level of effective immunity.“Even if you lower the efficacy, there would normally still be some neutralisation of the virus,” Vincent Enouf, from Paris’s Pasteur Institute, told AFP.To be on the safe side, Gupta advocated an accelerated vaccination programme, bestowing as much immunity as current vaccines can deliver “as fast as possible all over the world.”© Agence France-Presse"

High levels of transmission mean that we should expect more variants to emerge,” said the WHO.SARS-CoV-2 is the virus which causes Covid-19 disease.Since first being reported to the WHO on December 14, the British-identified variant VOC 202012/01 has been found in 50 countries, territories and areas, the agency said.Test results showed the age and sex distribution was similar to that of other circulating variants, while contact tracing data revealed “higher transmissibility (secondary attack rates) where the index case has the variant strain”.The South African-identified variant 501Y.V2, first reported on December 18, has now been detected in 20 countries, territories and areas.“From preliminary and ongoing investigations in South Africa, it is possible that the 501Y.V2 variant is more transmissible than variants circulating in South Africa previously,” the WHO weekly report said.“Moreover, while this new variant does not appear to cause more severe illness, the observed rapid increases in case numbers has placed health systems under pressure.”The geographical spread of both variants is likely underestimated, said the WHO, given a bias towards detection in countries with virus sequencing capacity. Meanwhile the agency said it had been notified by Japan on January 9 of a new variant detected in four travellers arriving from Brazil. The variant was found in two adults and two children.“This variant has 12 mutations to the spike protein, including three mutations of concern in common with VOC 202012/01 and 501Y.V2” it said, “which may impact transmissibility and host immune response”.The WHO said researchers in Brazil had additionally reported the emergence of a similar variant, which had likely evolved independently of the variant detected in Japan.“The extent and public health significance of these new variants require further investigation,” the report said.The WHO held a meeting of 1,750 international scientists on Tuesday to discuss critical knowledge gaps and research priorities for emerging variants.“Our collective goal is to get ahead of the game and have a global mechanism to quickly identify and study variants of concern and understand their implications for disease control efforts,” said Ana Maria Henao Restrepo, the WHO’s research and development chief.The WHO said the new variants showed the importance of increasing diagnostic capacity and systematic sequencing of the virus.“Research is ongoing to determine the impact of new variants on transmission, disease severity as well as any potential impacts on vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics,” the organisation said."

The first 1.2 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine arrived in December last year, while the second batch of 1.8 million doses arrived this January.Last week, President Widodo told his countrymen to be patient while they wait for the emergency use permit from the Indonesian FDA, BPOM, for the Sinovac vaccine.“The vaccine is already there, and is starting to be distributed to the regions. But we are still waiting for an emergency use permit from BPOM and a halal study from MUI,” he said in a tweet.Sedang menanti vaksin Covid-19? Sabar. Saya juga.Vaksinnya sudah ada, dan mulai didistribusikan ke daerah. Tapi kita masih menunggu izin penggunaan darurat dari BPOM dan kajian halal dari MUI.Apabila izin sudah keluar, vaksin gratis secara bertahap, kita laksanakan. — Joko Widodo (@jokowi) Widodo said that once the emergency use approval for the vaccine had been issued, Indonesia will start its COVID-19 vaccinations for free.The government had already started distribution of the Chinese-made vaccines this month as part of the preparation for its mass vaccination program.Indonesian President Widodo in December said that he was prepared to be the first to be given the vaccine shot just to prove the safety of the vaccine.Meanwhile, Turkey is also set to start by Thursday or Friday its vaccination roll-out using the Sinovac vaccine.Turkey has reported that clinical trials of the Sinovac developed vaccine showed an efficacy rate of 91.25 percent.The state-run Anadalu Agency of Turkey said that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had announced the start of inoculation of COVID-19 vaccines in the country will start by Thursday or Friday.“The COVID-19 vaccine will begin to be administered on Thursday or Friday in line with the determined order,” Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a press conference as quoted by the state-run news agency.Turkey received its first batch of 3 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine which it had ordered from China’s SinoVac Biotech on Dec. 30 last year."

But Bolsonaro, who says he does not plan to be vaccinated himself, has derided it as “Joao Doria’s Chinese vaccine.”"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/what-we-do-and-dont-know-about-new-covid-mutations/,Sinovac’s CoronaVac vaccine 78% effective in final stage clinical trials in Brazil,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — The emergence in Britain and South Africa of two new variants of Sars-CoV-2, which are potentially far more infectious versions of the virus, has prompted widespread concern. Here is what we know — and what we don’t — about the mutations. All viruses mutate when they replicate in order to adapt to their environment.Scientists have tracked multiple mutations of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, since it appeared in China in late 2019.The vast majority of mutations did not materially alter either the virus’s virulence or transmissibility.However, one mutation — variant B117, which likely emerged in southeastern England in September, according to Imperial College London — has now been detected in countries across the world, including the United States, France and India.Another variant, 501.V2, was detected in South Africa in October, and has since spread to several nations, including Britain and France.Both have multiple mutations to the virus, most notably on its spike protein — the part of the virus that latches on to human cells and helps it spread.Specifically, the mutated versions have an altered receptor binding domain known as N501Y, which is situated on the virus’ protein spike and which allows easier access to the ACE2 receptor in human cells.This makes the mutated versions potentially more infectious than other strains.The European Centre for Disease Control says that while there is “no clear relationship” between enhanced ACE2 binding and increased transmissibility, “it is plausible that such a relationship exists”. Indeed, several recent studies– yet to be peer-reviewed — have concluded that the British variant of Sars-CoV-2 is likely to be far more transmissible than other strains.The NERVTAG expert committee which advises the British government on disease control has estimated the new mutation is between 50 percent and 70 percent more transmissible.A team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) concurs, with experts putting increased transmissibility in the 50-74 percent range.Last week researchers at Imperial College London released the results of a study into thousands of genetic sequences of Sars-CoV-2 found in Britain between October and December.They found that the new variant had a “substantial transmission advantage”, with a reproduction rate between 0.4 and 0.7 higher than the unmutated virus.Preliminary studies on the South African variant have also concluded it is more contagious than regular Sars-CoV-2.Although initial data seems to confirm that the two new versions are more contagious, experts have urged caution.Bruno Coignard, head of infectious diseases at France’s heath authority Sante Publique France, told AFP that the British variant’s spread was due to “a combination of factors”.“These concern the virus’ characteristics but also prevention and control measures put in place,” he said. There is currently no evidence to suggest that the mutated viruses are any stronger than normal.But increased transmissibility alone poses an enormous problem, given that a small but consistent percentage of Covid-19 patients require hospital care.“Increased transmissibility eventually translates to a far higher incidence rate, and even with the same mortality, this means significant pressure on health systems,” said Coignard.Adam Kucharski, an epidemiologist at LSHTM, said that a virus that is 50 percent more contagious would be a “much bigger problem” than one that is 50 percent more deadly.In a Twitter thread, he explained how a disease such as Covid-19, with a reproduction (R) rate of 1.1 — where each patient on average infects 1.1 others — and a mortality rate of 0.8 percent would be expected to produce 129 deaths within a month.If the mortality rate increased 50 percent, the number of deaths would rise to 193.But due to the exponential growth in cases with a more contagious variant, a disease with a 50 percent higher transmission rate would see the death toll hit 978.Arnaud Fontanet, an epidemiologist with France’s science council, admitted on Monday that the new British variant was “extremely concerning right now”.Initial studies also concluded that the British variant was significantly more contagious among young people, which raises the issue of whether or not to keep schools open.The LSHTM study concluded that lockdowns similar to those seen across Britain in November would be insufficent to stem the new variant’s spread “unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed”. As vaccination campaigns get underway across the world, is there any reason to fear that the new mutations may not respond to the host of vaccines already on the market?After all, the messenger RNA vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna trick the body into reproducing the virus’s spike protein — the precise part of the pathogen that has mutated in the new versions.The ECDC said it was too soon to know if the mutations will impact vaccine efficacy.Last week Henry Walke from the American Centers for Disease Control told reporters that “experts believe our current vaccines will be effective against these strains”.On Monday however, Francois Balloux, professor of Computational Systems Biology and Director at University College London’s Genetics Institute said that the South African variant’s spike protein mutation “helps the virus to bypass immune protection provided by prior infection or vaccination”.German vaccine developer BioNTech said Friday its vaccine appeared to be effective at neutralising a variant of the coronavirus that shared a key spike protein mutation with the British variant.In unreviewed research, scientists in the US took blood samples from 20 people who had received two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and exposed them to virus molecules with the N501Y mutation.They found “no reduction in neutralisation activity against the virus bearing the (mutated) spike”. Coignard said it was impossible to eradicate the new viral variants entirely, although the goal from policymakers should be “maximum delay” of their spread.The ECDC says that in countries currently unaffected by the new mutations, “efforts to delay the spread should mirror those made during the earlier stage of the pandemic”.These include tests and quarantining of new arrivals, contact tracing and limited travel, it said.By sheer luck, certain existing PCR tests can detect the British variant.Fontanet therefore advocated “extremely aggressive surveillance” through widespread testing.“We need to be even more vigilant in our prevention measures to slow the spread of Covid-19 by wearing masks, staying at least six feet apart from people we don’t live with, avoiding crowds, ventilating indoor spaces and washing our hands,” said Walke."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/most-covid-19-patients-have-at-least-one-lingering-symptom-6-months-on-study/,says officials,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — More than three quarters of people hospitalized with Covid-19 still suffered from at least one symptom after six months, according to a study published Saturday that scientists said shows the need for further investigation into lingering coronavirus effects.The research, which was published in the Lancet medical journal and involved hundreds of patients in the Chinese city of Wuhan, is among the few to trace the long-term symptoms of Covid-19 infection.It found that fatigue or muscle weakness were the most common symptoms, while people also reported sleeping difficulties.“Because Covid-19 is such a new disease, we are only beginning to understand some of its long-term effects on patients’ health,” said lead author Bin Cao, of the National Center for Respiratory Medicine.The professor said the research highlighted the need for ongoing care for patients after they have been discharged from hospital, particularly those who have had severe infections.“Our work also underscores the importance of conducting longer follow-up studies in larger populations in order to understand the full spectrum of effects that Covid-19 can have on people,” he added.The World Health Organization has said the virus poses a risk for some people of serious ongoing effects — even among young, otherwise healthy people who were not hospitalised.The new study included 1,733 Covid-19 patients discharged from Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan between January and May last year.Patients, who had an average age of 57, were visited between June and September and answered questions on their symptoms and health-related quality of life.Researchers also conducted physical examinations and lab tests.The study found that 76 percent of patients who participated in the follow-up (1,265 of 1,655) said they still had symptoms.Fatigue or muscle weakness was reported by 63 percent, while 26 percent had sleep problems.The study also looked at 94 patients whose blood antibody levels were recorded at the height of the infection as part of another trial.When these patients were retested after six month, their levels of neutralising antibodies were 52.5 percent lower.The authors said this raises concerns about the possibility of Covid-19 re-infection, although they said larger samples would be needed to clarify how immunity to the virus changes over time.In a comment article also published in the Lancet, Monica Cortinovis, Norberto Perico, and Giuseppe Remuzzi, from Italy’s Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, said there was uncertainty over the long-term health consequences of the pandemic.“Unfortunately, there are few reports on the clinical picture of the aftermath of Covid-19,” they said, adding the latest study was therefore “relevant and timely”.They said longer term multidisciplinary research being conducted in the United States and Britain would help improve understanding and help develop therapies to “mitigate the long-term consequences of COVID-19 on multiple organs and tissues”.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/killer-fungus-spread-rampantly-at-us-hospital-covid-ward-study/,Top global oil exporter Saudi Arabia launches car-free city,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Dozens of people being treated for Covid-19 at a Florida hospital last summer became additionally infected with a mysterious, often deadly fungus called Candida auris, a US government study said Friday.The multidrug-resistant yeast was first identified in Japan in 2009 and has been a top priority for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in recent years because of its increasing global spread.C. auris is associated with up to 40 percent in-hospital mortality and is usually caught inside healthcare settings, especially when people have feeding or breathing tubes, or catheters placed in large veins.It causes bloodstream, wound and ear infections and has also been found in urine and respiratory samples, but it’s not clear if the fungus actually infects the lung or bladder.The recent outbreak began in July when a hospital — which the report did not name — notified the Florida Department of Health of an initial four cases of the fungus among patients being treated for the coronavirus.The next month, the hospital carried out additional screening in its Covid-19 unit, which spanned four floors across five wings, and identified 35 more patients as being C. auris-positive.Follow-up data was available for only 20 out of the 35 patients.Eight of these 20 people died, but it was not clear whether the fungus was the main factor or not. The Florida Department of Health and CDC performed a joint investigation focused on infection prevention and control measures, finding numerous weaknesses.“Mobile computers and medical equipment were not always disinfected between uses, medical supplies (e.g., oxygen tubing and gauze) were stored in open bins,” the CDC report said.It added that hospital staff, possibly out of fear of the coronavirus, were wearing multiple layers of personal protective equipment (PPE), which is not recommended and in fact heightens the risk of microbe transmission.There were also instances of extended PPE use and re-use.After the hospital removed supplies from hallways, enhanced cleaning and disinfection practices, and improved practices around PPE use, no further C. auris was detected on subsequent surveys.“Outbreaks such as that described in this report highlight the importance of adhering to recommended infection control and PPE practices and continuing surveillance for novel pathogens like C. auris,” the report concluded.C. auris has now been documented in more than 30 countries, with some 1,500 US cases reported to the CDC as of October 31, 2020.The CDC says the fungus can spread in healthcare settings “through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces or equipment, or from person to person.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/1-in-100000-had-severe-reactions-to-pfizer-vaccine-us-study/,What we do and don’t know about new Covid mutations,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Roughly one in a hundred thousand people who received the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine have had severe allergic reactions, US health officials said Wednesday while stressing that the benefits of immunization greatly outweigh the known risks.The data comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which documented 21 cases of anaphylaxis after administration of a reported 1,893,360 shots from December 14 to December 23.“This averages out to a rate of 11.1 anaphylaxis cases per one million doses administered,” senior CDC official Nancy Messonnier told reporters.By comparison, flu vaccines cause about 1.3 anaphylaxis cases per million doses administered, and so the rate of anaphylaxis for the Pfizer vaccine is roughly ten times greater.Messonnier added that anaphylaxis cases were still “exceedingly rare” and it remains in people’s best interest to take the vaccine, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic that is a far greater danger to their health.“A good value proposition for someone to get vaccinated is their risk from Covid and poor outcomes from Covid is still more than the risk of a severe outcome from the vaccine,” she said.“Fortunately, we know how to treat anaphylaxis, and we’ve put provisions in place to ensure that at immunization sites, the folks administering the vaccine are ready to treat anaphylaxis.”The 21 cases ranged in age from 27 to 60 years old, with a median age of 40, and all but two were treated with epinephrine.Nineteen of the cases (90 percent) occurred in females, and the median onset time of symptoms was 13 minutes, but ranged from two to 150 minutes.Four (19 percent) of patients were hospitalized, including three in intensive care, and 17 (81 percent) were treated in an emergency department. All but one was known to have been discharged home or recovered at the time of the study, and there were no deaths.Symptoms included rash, sensation of throat closure, swollen tongue, hives, difficulty breathing, hoarseness, swollen lips, nausea and persistent dry cough.– Investigations ongoing – The US has so far authorized two vaccines for emergency use — one developed by Pfizer and the other by Moderna.Both are based on cutting-edge mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) technology and authorities have attached similar warning labels to both, which advise that people who have a known history of allergic reactions to the vaccines’ ingredients avoid taking them.People who have a severe reaction to the first dose are also asked to not take a second dose.Messonnier said that investigations were underway to determine what may be the cause of the allergies.There is not enough data yet to know what the rate of anaphylaxis is for the Moderna vaccine, which was authorized in the US a week after the Pfizer shot, or whether a significant difference between the two vaccines will emerge.One preliminary hypothesis for the reactions is the presence of the compound polyethylene glycol (PEG), which has never before been used in an approved vaccine, but is found in everyday products including laxatives, shampoos and toothpastes.Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use PEG molecules as part of the protective casing around their main ingredient, the mRNA that carries genetic instructions to cells.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/israeli-firm-in-gaza-extracts-drinking-water-from-air/,Most Covid-19 patients have at least one lingering symptom 6 months on: study,1,"GAZA CITY, Palestinian Territories (AFP) — The densely populated Gaza Strip has long lacked sufficient drinking water, but a new project helps ease the shortage with a solar-powered process to extract potable water straight from the air.Unusually, the project operating in the Islamist-run Palestinian enclave, which has been blockaded by Israel since 2007, is the brainchild of a Russian-Israeli billionaire, Michael Mirilashvili.The company he heads, Watergen, has developed the atmospheric water generators that can produce 5,000 to 6,000 litres (1,300 to more than 1,500 gallons) of drinking water per day, depending on the air’s humidity.With just a few machines operating in Gaza, Watergen is far from meeting demand for the two million people who live in the crowded coastal enclave wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.“But, it’s a start,” said Fathi Sheikh Khalil, an engineer with the Palestinian civil society group Damour, which operates one of the machines because Israeli firms cannot work in Gaza.The strip, plagued by severe economic woes and regular power shortages, has also been facing a worsening water crisis for years.Its overused aquifer has been degraded by saltwater intrusion and contaminated by pollutants, making most available water salty and dangerous to drink and forcing the import of bottled water.Only three percent of Gaza’s own water meets international standards, according to the United Nations, which had in 2012 predicted that ecological pressures would have made Gaza “unliveable” by now.Multiple studies have linked rising rates of kidney stones and high incidence of diarrhoea in Gaza to the consumption of sub-standard water.Several players are working to solve the water shortage, including the European Union, which is supporting a massive seawater desalination plant.Watergen’s offices are located in a glass tower in Tel Aviv, some 80 kilometres (50 miles) north of Gaza.Mirilashvili bought Watergen after moving to Israel in 2009, and the company has since exported its machines to more than 80 countries.The company CEO and president has a colourful personal history, including time spent in a Russian prison following a kidnapping conviction in a trial the European Court of Justice later found was flawed.A religious Jew with a picture of a prominent Orthodox rabbi on his office wall, Mirilashvili told AFP that when he learnt about Gaza’s water crisis, he immediately wanted to help.“Our goal was that everyone on Earth could be supplied with drinkable water… It was immediately clear that we had to help our neighbours first.”Israel tightly controls imports to Gaza and Mirilashvili acknowledged that getting his machines approved “took some time”.Israel’s army “liked the idea, but needed to check the equipment,” he said.Watergen’s technology is suited to Gaza because it runs on solar panels, an asset in the enclave where the one power plant, which requires imported fuel, lacks the capacity to meet demand.Mirilashvili lamented that he cannot see his machines at work, as Israelis are forbidden from entering the strip.Watergen has donated two machines, which cost $61,000 each, to Gaza.A third machine was sent to the strip by the Arava Institute for Environmental Research, based on a kibbutz in southern Israel.One of the machines, a metal cube that roars as it runs, is located at the town hall in Khan Yunis in southern Gaza.After capturing humidity, the machine condenses it into water and then filters it into instantly drinkable water.When the air’s humidity level is above 65 percent, Watergen’s machines can produce about 5,000 litres of drinking water per day, said Khalil of the Palestinian group Damour.An additional 1,000 litres can be produced when the humidity level exceeds 90 percent.Some of the water is consumed by city hall employees and some transported to a local hospital for patients with kidney problems, Khalil said.“One or two machines won’t change anything,” he told AFP. But “it shows there is a solution”.Asked about working with a company based in Israel, which has fought three wars with Hamas since 2008, Khalil said: “We accept help from anyone who wants to help us.”Hamas did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mirilashvili said he did not believe Gazans see Watergen as a gift from him, an Israeli citizen and observant Jew.“They understood that this miracle is not from me,” he told AFP.“This is a present from God. They understood that when God gives you something, you need to accept it.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-validates-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-emergency-use-against-covid-19/,WHO validates Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use against COVID-19,1,"(Eagle News) — The World Health Organization (WHO) has given emergency validation to the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine, the first vaccine against COVID-19 to receive such a validation from WHO since the pandemic.This was after WHO listed the Comirnaty COVID-19 mRNA vaccine for emergency use. The Comirnaty vaccine requires storage using an ultra-cold chain and needs to be stored at -60°C to -90°C degrees, makes the deployment and distribution of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine “more challenging”But with the “emergency use listing” by WHO of the Comirnaty COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, it “opens the door for countries to expedite their own regulatory approval processes to import and administer” the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.“It also enables UNICEF and the Pan-American Health Organization to procure the vaccine for distribution to countries in need,” WHO said in a statement.“This is a very positive step towards ensuring global access to COVID-19 vaccines. But I want to emphasize the need for an even greater global effort to achieve enough vaccine supply to meet the needs of priority populations everywhere,” said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products.“WHO and our partners are working night and day to evaluate other vaccines that have reached safety and efficacy standards. We encourage even more developers to come forward for review and assessment. It’s vitally important that we secure the critical supply needed to serve all countries around the world and stem the pandemic.”WHO convened regulatory experts from around the world and together with its own teams, they reviewed “data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine’s safety, efficacy and quality as part of a risk-versus-benefit analysis.”“The review found that the vaccine met the must-have criteria for safety and efficacy set out by WHO, and that the benefits of using the vaccine to address COVID-19 offset potential risks,” it said.WHO said that the vaccine is “also under policy review.”WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) will convene on January 5, 2021, “to formulate vaccine specific policies and recommendations for this product’s use in populations, drawing from the SAGE population prioritization recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines in general, issued in September 2020.”WHO said that it is also “working to support countries in assessing their delivery plans and preparing for use where possible” given that the the Comirnaty vaccine such as that produced by Pfizer and BioNTech requires storage at -60°C to -90°C degrees.“This requirement makes the vaccine more challenging to deploy in settings where ultra-cold chain equipment may not be available or reliably accessible,” WHO said.WHO also explained that as part of the emergency use listing process, the “company producing the vaccine must commit to continue to generate data to enable full licensure and WHO prequalification of the vaccine.”“The WHO prequalification process will assess additional clinical data generated from vaccine trials and deployment on a rolling basis to ensure the vaccine meets the necessary standards of quality, safety and efficacy for broader availability,” its statement said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/astrazeneca-oxford-covid-vaccine-approved-for-use-in-uk/,AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid vaccine approved for use in UK,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — Britain on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s low-cost Covid vaccine, raising hopes it will help tackle rising cases and ease pressure on creaking health services.The independent Medicines and Healthcare products and Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the vaccine “met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness”, and a roll-out was set for January 4.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent several days in intensive care with Covid earlier this year, called it “truly fantastic news” and “a triumph for British science”.“We will now move to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible,” he tweeted.Britain has already approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for general use, and some 800,000 people have received a first dose in the country’s biggest ever vaccination drive.But as daily Covid infection rates hit record highs, the government is pinning its hopes on the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, which is cheaper to produce, and easier to store and transport.Unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, it does not require ultra-low freezing temperatures and can use normal refrigerated supply chains, making it a more attractive proposition globally.The partners, who have billed it as a “vaccine for the world”, have also promised to provide it not-for-profit to developing nations, and hope to make up to three billion doses in 2021. Britain is struggling with another surge in the virus, with a record 53,135 daily cases reported on Tuesday, heaping fresh pressure on health services during their busiest winter months.More than 71,000 people testing positive for the disease have now died — one of the worst tolls in the world.But doctors say many frontline healthcare workers have been struck down with a new, potentially more contagious variant of the virus, which is thought to be behind the surge.More than 24 million people, or 43 percent of England alone, are already living under strict stay-at-home measures, with bars, restaurants, pubs and other entertainment closed.The government is under pressure to follow other European countries and introduce even tougher restrictions, including delaying the return to school next week.Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to update parliament on Wednesday about whether to tighten the screw further.But he said approval of the new vaccine was a “way out of the pandemic”.“Now we need to hold our nerve while we get through this together,” he added.Britain has ordered 100 million doses and the Department of Health expects four million doses to be ready by the end of the year, and 40 million by the end of March.AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot called the approval “an important day for millions of people in the UK”.“It’s exactly what we need right now,” Andrew Hayward, professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at University College London, told BBC television.A “step change” in transmissibility has created “a race between us and the virus, and we need to slow the virus down as much as we can whilst we get as many people vaccinated as possible”, he added. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) in chimpanzees which has been genetically changed to stop Covid-19 replicating in humans.It delivers genetic cargo into cells, giving them instructions how to fight SARS-CoV-2.The vaccine costs about £2.50 ($3.40, 2.75 euros) per dose — a fraction of the price of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech drugs — which Hancock said provided hope for the rest of the world.“This vaccine will be made available to some of the poorest regions of the world at a low cost, helping protect countless people from this awful disease,” he added.On Sunday, Soriot said the vaccine provides “100 percent protection” against severe Covid disease requiring hospitalisation.He predicted trials would show his firm had achieved a vaccine efficacy equal to Pfizer/BioNTech at 95 percent and Moderna at 94.5 percent.Earlier trials had shown varying outcomes in the AstraZeneca shot’s efficacy.Initial large-scale trials in which volunteers in the UK and Brazil were given two full doses showed 62 percent effectiveness.For volunteers who received a half-dose first and then a full dose one month later, however, the vaccine was found to have 90 percent efficacy.The values were averaged to give the 70 percent figure reported by the developers in an interim study."

It said the vaccine was 86 percent effective, according to interim results of a Phase 3 trial.Beijing has pledged to share the vaccine at a fair cost — a potential boost for poorer Asian countries who are otherwise reliant on limited distribution offered by the COVAX scheme.“China has made the firm commitment that after China’s new coronavirus vaccines are completed and put into use, they will serve as a global public product and be supplied to the world at a fair and reasonable price,” foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Friday.“We will also give priority to developing countries for vaccines. This will be made through a variety of ways, including through donations and aid.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/from-the-lab-to-the-jab-how-biontech-pfizer-won-the-vaccine-race/,From the lab to the jab: how BioNTech-Pfizer won the vaccine race,1,"BERLIN, Germany (AFP) — It was over breakfast on the wintry morning of January 24 that Ozlem Tureci and her husband Ugur Sahin decided, “we need to fire the starting gun on this”.Sahin “had concluded from a publication describing coronavirus cases in Wuhan… that there was a high probability that a pandemic could be imminent”, Tureci recounted.The decision by the couple, founders of a small German company called BioNTech, gave birth to Operation Lightspeed — in which the scientists in the company diverted all their resources from cancer therapy research to finding a vaccine to stop Covid-19.“Since that day… there has not been a day when we took a break from working on this project,” said Tureci.Four days later, on January 28, Germany confirmed its first case of coronavirus infection — also the first known human-to-human transmission on European soil.What was an epidemic hitting China hardest soon morphed into a global health crisis, forcing governments to close borders, schools and offices and keep their populations at home to halt the spread.As BioNTech and other pharmaceutical companies leapt into action in search of the winning formula, Germany’s army of “Mittelstand” companies and other bigger manufacturing and logistics experts would soon prove crucial. Just a few minutes’ drive away from BioNTech’s headquarters in the city of Mainz, one such company quietly ramped up production.Little known to the rest of the world, the 130-year-old firm Schott is in fact a major player in the pharmaceutical industry because of its little glass vials designed to hold life-saving vaccines.Three-quarters of the more than 100 coronavirus inoculation trials across the world would end up using Schott products.The company alone aims to produce enough vials to hold two billion doses of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of 2021, head of communications Christina Rettig told AFP.Schott itself had an early scare with the virus at its Mitterteich plant in Bavaria.The town became one of Germany’s first coronavirus hotspots in March after a beer festival, and Rettig said several Schott workers from the Czech Republic ended up “not seeing friends and family for weeks” as borders slammed shut. With passenger flights mostly grounded, the buzz at Frankfurt airport’s terminals all but vanished to a hush in the spring.Its freight area however kept humming. Tens of thousands of boxes of urgently needed surgical gowns and masks were transiting through.The head of freight infrastructure at Fraport, Max Philipp Conrady, knew that was just the beginning for his division in the pandemic battle.No one knew then which company would find a vaccine or when it would be ready, but Frankfurt is already Europe’s largest hub for transporting pharmaceutical goods.And so planning had to begin for the unprecedented logistical challenge of transporting millions of life-saving vaccine doses worldwide.Fraport’s vast temperature-controlled hangar handled 120,000 tons of vaccines, drugs and other pharmaceutical products in 2019.The operator anticipated the demand for cold storage, and boosted investments in high-tech refrigerated “dollies” that would do the transporting from hangars to planes. It now has 20, so several freighters can be loaded at the same time. Fraport was not the only one upping investments in solutions to keep things cool.As it became clear that BioNTech’s vaccine would need to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit) the expertise of cold chain management became the next hot commodity in town.Amid the global scramble to solve the problem of keeping vaccines at the right temperature as they get transported across the world, it would appear that there is a German company for every obscure application.Binder in Tuttlingen has its “super freezers” which were already tapped as early as March to chill coronaviruses used in laboratory research by BioNTech and another German vaccine developer, CureVac.But demand further grew as BioNTech advanced in the race.“It started really in August, when we received these requests from logistics companies… they knew we must fit our cold storage… with freezers in order to distribute the vaccines around the world,” said Binder spokeswoman Anne Lenze.While Binder ensured static refrigeration of up to minus 90 degrees, another company Va-Q-Tec makes moving boxes with an ultra-cool function for the actual transportation process.Using a silica particle technology, the containers can maintain temperatures ranging from one similar to a fridge to polar chills for up to 10 days “without the need for energy input”, chief executive Joachim Kuhn told AFP.On November 18, BioNTech and its partner Pfizer finally announced that their Phase III study showed around 95 percent efficacy against the virus.The news sent stock markets into euphoria and was hailed as a watershed, a light at the end of a very long, dark tunnel.By then, the logistics sector was raring to go.As Fraport’s Conrady put it: “We’ve been ready since August.” Celebrating in their understated manner, BioNTech’s founders knew it was too early to rest on their laurels.“Champagne is not our thing. We sat down and enjoyed a cup of tea and used the time to reflect on what had happened so far and what will come next,” Sahin told AFP.Several hundred kilometres away in the German capital, 66-year-old Albrecht Broemme was placing a bunch of Lego figurines here and there as he visualised how to transform Berlin’s old airports into centres for the unprecedented vaccination drive.An ex-firefighter and former head of civil protection agency THW, Broemme had been called out of retirement to help in the pandemic battle.Early on, he was pivotal in designing emergency sites in case patient numbers were to soar above hospital capacities.In the autumn, he was tapped again to conceptualise the vaccination drive for the German capital.“I came up with a system, thinking about how many (vaccination) booths we would need and how much space we would need in order to prevent bottlenecks,” he said.Each visitor will follow a designated route from registration to the actual jab, then on to a consultation with a doctor and finally to a waiting room while final checks are performed.The patient should be in and out of the doctor’s cubicle in a few minutes, Broemme said. Including the queueing and waiting time, “we imagine that all of this will take an hour.” On December 2, BioNTech’s vaccine became the first to get the go-ahead for use in the West, when Britain gave its approval.As other nations from the United States to Saudi Arabia to Singapore followed suit, Germany impatiently prodded the EU’s drugs regulator to bring forward its decision from December 29.The EMA finally gave its green light more than a week early, on December 21.On the same night, the European Commission declared that the entire bloc would start the inoculation operation from Sunday, December 27.As vaccine doses began arriving around Europe Saturday, German Health Minister Jens Spahn called it a “day of hope” but warned that getting everyone immunised would be a “long-haul” effort.With the first jabs imminent, officials raced to put the finishing touches on the makeshift inoculation centres across Germany.At the country’s biggest in Hamburg, doctors will be able to handle 7,000 daily jabs.BioNTech has also held webinars for nurses and doctors who will soon administer the shot, with 1,100 questions answered during the sessions.Lorries carrying vaccines rolled out from Pfizer’s factory in Belgium on Wednesday.BioNTech said it would directly supply its vaccines to 25 distribution sites manned by federal authorities in Germany which would then send along the allocations to 294 districts.Local authorities will then further funnel the jabs down to 450 vaccination centres.A slew of mobile units will also be deployed to harder to reach districts.With an eye on potential sabotage by a growing wave of corona skeptics and anti-vaxxers, federal police with armed commando units are escorting the precious cargo on the move.First up will be the most vulnerable in elderly homes, several of which have been hit by deadly outbreaks of the virus.The inoculations could not come soon enough for Germany, which registered record high daily death tolls of nearly 1,000 people during the week. At least one district has reported that its crematorium is full.With time pressing, one elderly care home went ahead with first vaccinations for its residents shortly after the doses were delivered on Saturday — a day ahead before the national inoculation campaign was due to start.Edith Kwoizalla, 101 years old, became the first in Germany to receive the jab in the elderly home in Saxony-Anhalt state.For Chancellor Angela Merkel, every jab means a life saved.“When we see how many people are dying because of coronavirus, we can see how many lives the vaccine can save.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/virus-strain-to-cause-more-deaths-in-britain-mutated-covid-strain-56-more-contagious-study/,Virus strain to cause more deaths in Britain; mutated COVID strain 56% more contagious -study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — A mutated coronavirus strain spreading in Britain is on average 56 percent more contagious than the original version, scientists have warned in a study, urging a fast vaccine rollout to help prevent more deaths.The new variant, which emerged in southeast England in November and is spreading fast, is likely to boost hospitalisations and deaths from Covid next year, according to the study published Wednesday by the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Researchers, focusing on the English south east, east and London, said it was still uncertain whether the mutated strain was more or less deadly than its predecessor.“Nevertheless, the increase in transmissibility is likely to lead to a large increase in incidence, with Covid-19 hospitalisations and deaths projected to reach higher levels in 2021 than were observed in 2020, even if regional tiered restrictions implemented before 19 December are maintained,” they said.The authors warned that a national lockdown imposed in England in November was unlikely to prevent an increase of infections “unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed”.Any easing of control measures, meanwhile, would likely prompt “a large resurgence of the virus”.This meant that “it may be necessary to greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to have an appreciable impact in suppressing the resulting disease burden”.In announcing more stringent lockdown measures over the December holiday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Saturday the new viral strain “may be up to 70 percent more transmissible than the original version of the disease”.The discovery of the new strain set off alarm bells worldwide just as more countries began vaccination campaigns to halt a pandemic that has claimed more than 1.7 million lives since it emerged a year ago in China.Many countries quickly imposed bans on travel from Britain, but EU governments have since begun to relax the restrictions.The co-founder of BioNTech — one of the firms behind the vaccine that is being rolled out worldwide this week — has said its drug is “highly likely” to work against the mutated strain detected in Britain and otherwise can be adapted in six weeks."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/well-drilling-thrives-as-caracas-water-supply-flounders/,Well drilling thrives as Caracas water supply flounders,1,"CARACAS, Venezuela (AFP) — Alfredo Araya used to dig wells on farms or out in the countryside, but due to a failing water supply he says demand for his services has recently exploded in Venezuela’s capital Caracas.Using a huge drill to perforate the soil, Araya struck the underground aquifer below an apartment bloc in Caracas’ comfortable Los Palos Grandes neighborhood so that residents now have access to water that jets out of a hose.Drilling down 90 meters (295 feet) to find a water supply can cost $20,000 in a country where the minimum wage — including a government food stamp — is worth just over $2 a month.But in Caracas — a city of seven million people — neighbors have been pooling resources and “paying together” to fund wells, said Araya, a 68-year-old engineer.Dalila Escalona put $400 of her savings into one such fund.“We’re making a great sacrifice… the collection hasn’t been easy,” the 59-year-old architect said.“Although we’re all committed, we’re not all able to pay.”After five months of negotiations via a WhatsApp group, her building’s residents were finally able to pool the necessary money to build the well.It’s a scenario being repeated all over Caracas and the numbers are growing exponentially, Araya says.Crisis-struck Venezuela has struggled through three years of hyperinflation and been in recession for seven years, with a water supply that has suffered badly.The independent Public Services Observatory estimates that almost nine out of every 10 Venezuelans suffers from interruptions in their water supply, with some communities going months without receiving a drop.The reserve that supplies Caracas has seen output decrease by 40 percent in the last 20 years.More than 55 percent of Venezuela’s 30 million people have to store water in pots and bottles, according to the observatory, while 18.5 percent pay for water to be delivered by tankers.Caracas is sitting on “a huge water deposit” that is supplied by rain and streams that run from the El Avila mountain to the north of the capital, Jose Maria de Viana, the former president of the state water company Hidrocapital, told AFP.Several parts of the capital were supplied by this reserve in the 1950s and ’60s but wells were gradually replaced by water mains completed in 1980, de Viana said.Reservoirs located miles away from the capital are used by Hidrocapital to supply Caracas.Water was provided almost free of charge under late former president Hugo Chavez who came to power in 1999 but that took huge public investment and the pumping stations have fallen into disrepair under his successor Nicolas Maduro.Whereas 20 years ago Caracas received 20,000 liters (5,280 gallons) of water a second, it now receives only 12,000.Altogether, the factors have created fierce competition between drilling companies in the capital.Requests have multiplied during the coronavirus pandemic as many people began to see “the necessity” of having a well, Araya said.But it’s not all smooth sailing. These companies need state permits to operate, which can take time.And when drilling on public land, security services can ask for “contributions,” said Araya.The bribes, he added, are simply “a toll you have to pay.”Some local councils, like the opposition-controlled Chacao municipality in Caracas, have drilled wells for free in the areas worst-hit by shortages.It has built five wells, with another two under construction, a project hugely appreciated by residents such as Julio Blanco, 45, who lives in the poor El Bucaral neighborhood.He spent almost three months without access to running water and at times went to El Avila with a wheelbarrow to fill up drums.“When water arrives here we all jump. It’s emotional,” said Blanco.Living without water, he said, “is traumatic.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/virus-hunters-delve-into-gabon-forest-in-search-for-next-threat/,Virus hunters delve into Gabon forest in search for next threat,1,"ZADIE CAVES, Gabon (AFP) — The scene looks like something out of a science fiction movie, or maybe some dystopian TV series.Six men in yellow biohazard suits clamber in suffocating heat towards a cave in the heart of the Gabonese jungle.Their quest: to unlock new knowledge on how pathogens like coronavirus leap the species barrier to humans.In the cave is their goal — a colony of bats.“Our job is to look for pathogens which could endanger humans and understand how transmission happens between species,” explained Gael Maganga, a professor at the University of Franceville.Bats can be hosts to viruses that do not harm them but can be dangerous to Homo sapiens, often crossing via other animals.Covid-19 is just the latest microbe believed to have taken the zoonotic path from animals to humans.It notably follows three other respiratory viruses, MERS in 2012, SARS in 2003 and H5N1 flu in 1997; the haemorrhagic virus Ebola in 1976; and AIDS, which is believed to have crossed over from chimps about a century ago, possibly through hunters who handled infected meat.Getting to the cave is hard work. The team have to almost wade through thick soil, pieces of bark and russet-coloured leaves that exhale the musky perfume of the forest.The environment here — hot and humid and filled with natural hazards — is tough for humans, but perfect for viruses.Bit by bit, the scent of damp earth yields to the smell of bat droppings, which eventually becomes suffocating in the sticky air. Bees and silvery butterflies dance around the heads of the virus hunters, their faces dripping in sweat beneath their goggles.Above them, the tree tops seem to lose themselves in the sky, and gnarly creepers hang down, as if suspended from the heavens.The mouth of the cave suddenly rears up ahead, and a stream of bats flies out. A thick white bedding of bat droppings spreads across the ground and the rocks.Maganga calls on the team to stretch a net across the cave’s dark maw and the bats, suddenly sensing the alien presence of humans, start to hunker down inside.But one of the scientists moves forward, shining his torch inside. Bats fly out and get caught in the net.Now the real scientific stuff can begin. The team take out sterile swabs and take samples from the bats’ mouths and rectums.These are then carefully stored for transport back to the lab, where they will be analysed for any emerging pathogen.To any who would blame the bats for the catastrophe of coronavirus, the scientists are bluntly dismissive.Human encroachment on their habitat, they say, has brought the two mammal species into closer, riskier proximity.“Human behaviour is often the cause of an emerging virus,” said Maganga. “Today, with population pressure, intensified farming or hunting, contact between humans and animals is more and more frequent.”Maganga is also co-director of the Emerging Viral Diseases Unit at Franceville’s Interdisciplinary Centre for Medical Research (CIRMF).It hosts one of Africa’s two P4 laboratories — ultra-high-risk labs that operate at top levels of security.A report issued in October by the UN’s biodiversity panel IPBES said there were up to 850,000 viruses that exist in animals and may infect humans.Seventy percent of emerging diseases circulate in animals before jumping to humans, and each year around five new diseases break out among humans, it said.Pauline Grentzinger, a vet at the Lekedi Nature Park, a biodiversity haven near Franceville, warned against the conventional thinking “that it’s humans on one side and animals on the other.”“In health terms, what happens with one (species) has a repercussion on the other. To protect natural fauna is to protect humans,” she said.In Gabon, every outbreak of Ebola has occurred in the Zadie Caves area, which lies close to the border with the Republic of Congo. CIRMF researchers have found samples of Ebola virus among bats, confirming that the flying mammals were the host.Maganga has also uncovered a number of coronavirus strains circulating among bats, including some that are close to the Covid-19 strain that infects humans.Despite the obvious risk, hunters still come into the area to hunt for animals — antelopes, gazelles, monkeys and bats.In April, Gabon imposed a ban on the sale of bats and pangolins, another species deemed to be a potential vector of coronavirus.But villagers living near the caves say they have yet to see a case of Covid — and for many, poverty seems to trump any danger.“In one night, I can earn a month’s money,” said Aristide Roux, a 43-year-old hunter, showing the body of a gazelle on a tree stump by the side of the road.© Agence France-Presse"

In the US, deaths have surpassed 300,000, a milestone that underscores the human toll of this crisis,” she added.In Central America, the agency noted that Panama and Belize were registering an increase in cases, while Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua were reporting relatively few infections.However, Etienne warned that this trend should be viewed with caution as hurricanes Eta and Iota may have impacted systems for recording Covid cases and there may also be many displaced people.Regarding the situation in the south of the continent, Brazil and Colombia were the countries with the most new cases, and PAHO indicated that there was a worrying rise in infections in southern Brazil.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/uk-issues-allergy-warning-over-pfizer-biontech-vaccine/,UK issues allergy warning over Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — British health officials on Wednesday warned that anyone with a history of significant allergic reactions should not have the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab for the time being.The warning came after two members of the state-run National Health Service who were among the first to receive the vaccine on Tuesday suffered allergic reactions and needed treatment.NHS England medical director Stephen Powis said both people, who had a history of reactions, were now recovering well.The independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has now advised that “people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination” as a precaution, he added.“Significant” allergic reactions include those to medicines, food or vaccines, according to the MHRA.Thousands of Britons became the first in the Western world to received an approved Covid vaccine on Tuesday as the NHS began the biggest vaccination drive since it was created in 1948.The vaccine is administered in two doses, 21 days apart. The over-80s and health and social care staff are first in line to get the jab in the national rollout.Britain has received some 800,000 doses of the vaccine in the first batch of an order of 40 million. Up to four million doses are expected by the end of December.Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla on Tuesday said he understood global concerns about the speed with which pharmaceutical companies have produced vaccines against Covid-19.But he insisted no corners have been cut.The vaccine had been tested “in the exact same way as we are testing any vaccine that is circulating out there”, he told a virtual media briefing in Geneva.Pfizer said the MHRA had told it of the allergic reactions but said during phase 3 trials of more than 40,000 people, the vaccine was “generally well-tolerated with no serious safety concerns” reported."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/hackers-targeting-covid-19-vaccine-supply-chain-ibm-warns/,Hackers targeting Covid-19 vaccine supply chain,1,"NEW YORK, United States (AFP) — With multiple vaccines close to becoming available in a world gripped by the coronavirus pandemic, manufacturers have become the target of hackers trying to steal trade secrets or disrupt supply chains.IBM warned Thursday that it had uncovered a series of cyber attacks, potentially carried out by state actors, against companies involved in the effort to distribute vaccine doses, which must be kept cold.IBM said the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union was one target of the attacks, as well as European and Asian companies involved in the supply chain, whose names have not been disclosed.“Our team recently uncovered a global phishing campaign targeting organizations associated with a COVID-19 cold chain,” Claire Zaboeva and Melissa Frydrych, analysts for IBM X-Force, a cyber security working group, wrote in a blog post.The purpose “may have been to harvest credentials, possibly to gain future unauthorized access to corporate networks and sensitive information relating to the COVID-19 vaccine distribution.”It was unclear if the attacks were successful, IBM said, and while it could not identify those behind the attacks, the precision of the operation signals “the potential hallmarks of nation-state tradecraft.”The vaccine developed by Pfizer and German company BioNTech, which on Wednesday got the green light from Britain to distribute its vaccine, must be stored below -70 degrees Celsius to ensure its effectiveness.That means it will require specialized logistics companies such as Haier Biomedical, a Chinese-owned cold chain supply company working with the World Health Organization and the United Nations.Hackers impersonated an executive from Haier Biomedical, and “disguised as this employee, the adversary sent phishing emails to organizations believed to be providers of material support to meet transportation needs within the COVID-19 cold chain,” Zaboeva and Frydrych wrote.Moderna also has developed a vaccine that must be stored at -20 degrees Celsius, while AstraZeneca’s version can be stored in a normal freezer.Cybercriminals also have tried to attack several pharmaceutical companies developing vaccines including Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, AstraZeneca and South Korean laboratories, according to the Wall Street Journal.Spanish laboratories also reportedly have been attacked by Chinese cybercriminals, the El Pais newspaper reported in September.Cold storage giant Americold last month reported a hack into its computer systems to the US stock market regulator, without specifying whether the attack was related to the group’s role in vaccine storage.“The intellectual property relating to mass market pharmaceuticals has tremendous value and so is a significant prize for a cybercriminal,” said Mark Kedgley, chief technology officer at New Net Technologies (NNT), a Naples, Florida-based provider of cybersecurity and compliance software.And Covid-19 vaccines draw “Nation State level hacking.”The countries experts most often linked to cyber attacks are Russia, China and North Korea, although there is no formal proof of their involvement in the recent incidents.But cybersecurity firm Kapersky notes the use of “false flags” including Russian-linked email addresses, in a possible move to deflect blame for the attacks.There also could be financial motives behind the attacks.Brett Callow, threat analyst at Emisoft, said the attacks are not surprising.“States or non state actors will try to use any situation that they can to obtain an advantage, whether it’s a political or a financial advantage,” he told AFP. “It’s pretty much inconceivable that anything Covid-related wouldn’t come under attack.”The US federal cyber security agency, CISA, said the IBM report should be taken seriously by organizations involved in the vaccine supply chain.“CISA encourages all organizations involved in vaccine storage and transport to harden attack surfaces, particularly in cold storage operation, and remain vigilant against all activity in this space,” Josh Corman, a CISA strategist, told AFP.The labs, too, will be on alert.“Much of the large pharma companies have the skills and cybersecurity organizations to be able to detect this malicious type code and to protect against it,” Marrene Allison, chief information security officer for Johnson & Johnson, said Thursday during a conference hosted by the Aspen Institute.But, she said, “unfortunately, not everyone has that in the health care industry.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/romanias-mining-heartland-faces-up-to-post-coal-future/,Romania’s mining heartland faces up to post-coal future,1,", In the large, dark locker room of southern Romania’s Lonea coal mine, 20-year-old Liviu dons his uniform and helmet before embarking on a six-hour shift in a vanishing industry.“I found this job interesting because you retire faster, when you reach 45 years old,” Liviu tells AFP before descending 400 metres underground in an elevator dubbed “the birdcage” by his fellow miners.But whether he gets to retire as a miner may be out of Liviu’s control as Romania tries to bring an end to 160 years of coal-mining history in the Jiu Valley region.Out of 15 mines active there before the fall of communism in 1989, only four are still operating today and two are already scheduled to close.While the rest of Romania gears up for parliamentary elections on Sunday, the prevailing mood in the Jiu Valley is one of apathy and mistrust.“What hope can I have? Who has ever tried to do something for this valley”, says 38-year-old miner Lucian Iganescu, from nearby Vulcan.The sector historically enjoyed support from the communist regime and thereafter from left-wing president Ion Iliescu, who in the 1990s deployed miners against street protesters on several occasions.But since joining the EU in 2007, Bucharest has wound down subsidies for the loss-making coal sector and production has plummeted from 22 million tonnes in 1992 to just 600,000 tonnes last year.The Jiu Valley now counts just 4,500 miners down from some 54,000 in 1990.Alin Udvar, manager of the Lonea mine, expects the last ton of coal to be extracted as soon as 2024.While he hopes that some of his 543 employees will then be transferred to neighbouring sites, they are scheduled to close in 2030.Udvar echoes Liviu in giving one of the main attractions of the profession: “You become a miner to retire early.”In Romania, one of the EU’s poorest countries, a miner with 20 years experience receives a pension of 4,000 lei (830 euros or $1,000), almost 10 per cent more than a miner’s average salary.But there is a high price to pay. According to Udvar, the average life expectancy for the men of the Jiu Valley is around 55 years.“I wouldn’t hire my 18-year-old boy in the mine for all the money in the world. This job is hard, dangerous and eats away at your health,” 44-year-old miner Ferenc Balog told AFP at the end of his shift, his face covered in coal dust.“There are no options here for young people other than emigration.”According to a study carried out by PwC auditors, the region’s population has fallen from around 170,000 inhabitants in 1997 to 133,00 last year.Breathless due to silicosis, a lung disease that decimates miners, 63-year-old Petre Brait says he covered up his bad health when he was younger to keep going down the mine.“I had no choice, my children were still small,” he says.But now he knows that there is no future for mining.“Romania must reduce emissions, it cannot continue to move against the grain,” he says.Danut Buhaescu, mayor of another town in the valley, Uricani, criticises successive governments for “lying” about the future of mining, without preparing the area for the industry’s disappearance.The country’s hopes of coping with the upheaval are pinned in large part on the EU’s Just Transition Fund, designed to help coal-dependent regions as the bloc tries to become carbon neutral by 2050.According to the centre-right government, the country should receive 1.9 billion euros ($2.3 billion) for the switch to renewable energy.Several wind energy producers have said they are ready to recruit in the Jiu Valley, hoping to obtain government aid in the process.But the miners who have swapped coal for wind can be counted on the fingers of one hand.Udvar recalls a group who went to the south-eastern city of Constanta to work on one of the biggest wind farms in the country.“I think only one of them stayed there,” he says.Lucian Ignatescu is among those who made that trip but subsequently returned to the valley.While he does not rule out retraining, he says it will be “only after I retire from mining”.Buhaescu meanwhile holds out hope that EU money could help develop sustainable tourism.“We have an exceptional region, intact forests, a wealth that should not be destroyed,” he says.Whichever way out of coal the valley chooses, “our children deserve a healthy future,” he says.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/ai-program-deepmind-untangles-one-of-biologys-great-challenges/,AI program DeepMind,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — For decades scientists have been trying to figure out how to swiftly predict the twisting, tangled shape of proteins — and from there unravel a greater understanding of the machinery of life itself.This week an Artificial Intelligence program created by Google sister firm DeepMind was shown to have virtually cracked the challenge, forecasting the way in which proteins contort into three dimensional structures in the results of a biannual competition that judges hailed as a game changer.“In some sense the problem is solved,” said John Moult, a computational biologist at the University of Maryland who co-founded the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) competition in 1994, quoted by the journal Nature.Janet Thornton of the European Bioinformatics Institute said in a statement from the competition organisers on Monday that the work to solve the problem was a “triumph of human curiosity, endeavour and intelligence”.“A better understanding of protein structures and the ability to predict them using a computer means a better understanding of life, evolution and, of course, human health and disease,” said Thornton, who is not affiliated with CASP or DeepMind.The cells of all living beings contain thousands of proteins, workhorses that catalyse most chemical reactions in the body.They are essential to life — from muscle function to carrying oxygen in the blood — and are also the key to diseases like cancer and even Covid-19.A protein is begins as a strand of amino acids, which then crumples into a unique three-dimensional tangle.It is this shape that directly relates to its function.Scientists have puzzled for half a century over how to accurately and quickly predict which formation — out of an unfathomably large number of possibilities — a protein might take by looking at its amino acid chain, a process that may take years in the laboratory.The CASP contest involved around 100 teams who were given the amino acid sequences for dozens of proteins and tasked with estimating their final shapes — which were known to the organisers.DeepMind — whose programme AlphaGo stunned the world in 2016 by beating an elite human player in the complex strategy game “Go” — was already at the top of the field in the last contest in 2018.This time its AlphaFold programme determined the shape of many of the proteins “to a level of accuracy comparable to that achieved with expensive and time-consuming lab experiments”, according to the CASP organisers.Andrei Lupas, an evolutionary biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology who was part of the assessment team, told that AlphaFold had helped him determine the structure of a protein that his lab had been trying to pin down for a decade.“This will change medicine. It will change research. It will change bioengineering. It will change everything,” he told Nature.Derek Lowe, who , described protein folding as like “watching piles of hinged lumber spontaneously restack themselves into functional boats, wagons and treehouses”.He said the AlphaFold results did not mean the programme would consistently come up with the right protein structure.“But getting that level of structural accuracy on that many varied proteins is something that has just never been done before.”DeepMind said it was looking at how the programme might help increase knowledge of certain diseases, for example to identify whether a protein has malfunctioned.“These insights could enable more precise work on drug development, complementing existing experimental methods to find promising treatments faster,” it said in a statement.The firm added that it was working to produce a peer-reviewed paper and was “exploring how best to provide broader access to the system”.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/putin-orders-large-scale-vaccinations-to-start-next-week/,untangles one of biology’s great challenges,1,"MOSCOW, Russia (AFP) — President Vladimir Putin told health officials Wednesday to start widespread vaccinations next week, adding that Russia has produced close to two million doses of its Sputnik V vaccine.The announcement came on the day Britain approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for a rollout starting next week.Last week Russia reported interim test results showing Sputnik V was 95 percent effective, rivalling international competitors for efficacy.Sputnik V — dubbed after the Soviet-era satellite — is currently in its third and final stage of clinical trials involving some 40,000 volunteers.“I would ask you to organise the work so that by the end of next week we will have started this large-scale vaccination,” Putin said.He noted that teachers and medics will be the first to receive the jab.“More than two million doses have been produced or will be produced in the next few days,” Putin added.The Sputnik V vaccine uses two different human adenovirus vectors and is administered in two doses with a 21-day gap.The vaccine will be free to all Russian citizens and innoculation will be voluntary.Last week Russia’s defence ministry announced that a mass vaccination campaign has been rolled out in the army, aiming to vaccinate over 400,000 servicemen, including 80,000 by the end of this year.Speaking via video link at a UN presentation of the vaccine on Wednesday, Russia’s Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said that over 100,000 people have so far been vaccinated with Sputnik V.At the same conference, Kirill Dmitriyev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund that has been involved in developing the vaccine, said more than 40 countries have expressed interest in the vaccine.He added that preliminary orders for over 1.2bn doses have been made.Russia has the fourth highest virus caseload in the world, with a total of 2,347,401 registered cases and 41,053 fatalities.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/what-is-it-like-to-take-part-in-a-vaccine-trial/,Putin orders ‘large-scale’ vaccinations to start next week,1,"A key facet of the global mad scramble by Pfizer, Moderna and other pharma groups to develop a viable coronavirus vaccine is the recruitment of tens of thousands of volunteers willing to participate in clinical trials.AFP’s correspondent in Miami, Leila Macor, took part in such a trial organized by US biotech firm Moderna, which announced Monday that its experimental vaccine was nearly 95 percent effective.Why did Macor, who suffers from asthma, decide to be one of Moderna’s 30,000 test subjects? Here, she recounts her experience, which began just weeks after her own father died of Covid-19 in Chile. Three weeks before Pfizer and Moderna launched their coronavirus vaccine clinical trials in late July, my father passed away — alone, as so many have in this crisis.As our family lived through the trauma, and said goodbye as best we could, I was confronting another stark and dangerous reality — Miami was becoming a major US virus hotspot, and my job was to cover the story.But my life has been irrevocably changed. I lost my dad, and I have asthma, which could lead to serious complications if I were to be infected.The idea of taking action to help bring this deadly medical emergency under control offered me some inner peace.Let me be clear, this was a totally personal decision that had nothing to do with work.I talked it over with friends and family, who helped me decide that any possible side effects from the trial would not be worse than getting Covid-19.So I took the plunge.Two days after writing a story about the start of phase 3 trials in Florida, I once again knocked on the door of a lab — this time as a potential subject.Research Centers of America, located in the Miami suburb of Hollywood, was working on trials for Pfizer and Moderna, alternating every other day.Dozens of other labs were recruiting volunteers across the United States. Anyone was eligible, as long as they were in high-risk jobs: doctors, taxi drivers, grocery store workers… and reporters.I made an appointment for a Tuesday in mid-August. That happened to be a Moderna day. Lab staff put a name tag on me and brought me to an office, where they explained what would happen. They also gave me a 22-page document with all the details.The trial consists of two doses. Volunteers are paid $2,400 over the course of the two-year study. They warned of possible side effects — from pain at the injection site to fever and chills.The 30,000 subjects are divided in two groups: those who get the vaccine and those who get a placebo.“Even we don’t know which is which,” the nurse told me, when I asked about my group. Only Moderna knows — but not until the data is compiled and analyzed.I asked about getting an antibody test, but the nurse said the results were not foolproof.“Not knowing is going to kill me,” I said.As she took my blood pressure, the nurse looked up at me and said, in a quite serious tone: “Placebos are as important as the vaccine. The trial needs a control group. You are helping humanity either way.”I felt guilty for obsessing over my status, rather than concentrating on the overall goal — helping everybody overcome this pandemic. So I stopped asking questions. The nurse took six to eight vials of my blood — I lost count. They gave me a pregnancy test, and stressed the importance of using contraception during the trial, saying the potential side effects for a fetus were unknown.Then two people came in with the vaccine in a cooler. Or maybe it was the placebo.They laughed when I asked to document the moment in a picture. For them, it was just another Tuesday.The injection didn’t hurt. They took me to a waiting room, where I stayed for half an hour of observation as a precaution. Three or four other volunteers scrolled through their phones as they waited.One of the nurses wore a Superman cape.“Why the cape?” I asked.“Because we are all heroes here, girl,” she said.I got a bunch of swag — stickers, a t-shirt, a mask — with “Covid warriors” or “Covid superheroes” written on it.The lab had me download an app to track my temperature and any eventual symptoms.When I got home, my arm was a bit sore. I wondered — did I actually get the vaccine? Three days of internet searches about “vaccine injection site,” “muscle pain” and other terms got me nowhere.The second dose came in mid-September. It hurt a lot more, and for a while. A hard, red knot emerged at the injection site.But I still have no idea if it was the placebo or the vaccine. I have to wait for Moderna to tell me — someday.I eventually realized that taking part in the trial was a way to process my grief — over losing my father and seeing the world turned upside down.It was a small gesture, but it was the only way I knew how to make myself believe we are fighting back."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/growing-antimicrobial-resistance-as-dangerous-as-pandemic-who/,What is it like to take part in a vaccine trial?,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization warned Friday that growing antimicrobial resistance is every bit as dangerous as the coronavirus pandemic — and threatens to reverse a century of medical progress.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the issue “one of the greatest health threats of our time”.Resistance is when bugs become immune to existing drugs — antibiotic, antiviral or antifungal treatments — rendering minor injuries and common infections potentially deadly.Resistance has grown in recent years due to overuse of such drugs in humans and also in farm animals.“Antimicrobial resistance may not seem as urgent as a pandemic but it is just as dangerous,” Tedros told a virtual press conference.“It threatens to unwind a century of medical progress and leave us defenceless against infections that today can be treated easily,” he said.The WHO said antimicrobial resistance was endangering food security, economic development and the planet’s ability to fight diseases.Resistance has led to increased health care costs, hospital admissions, treatment failures, severe illnesses and deaths, the UN health agency said.The WHO joined forces with the Food and Agriculture Organization and with the World Organisation for Animal Health to launch a new group to advocate for urgent action to combat the threat.The One Health Global Leaders Group on Antimicrobial Resistance will bring together heads of government, company chief executives and civil society leaders.The group is co-chaired by Prime Ministers Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh and Mia Mottley of Barbados.“We need worldwide coordinated actions to monitor the nature of infections, to implement required control measures and raise global awareness against the widespread use of antibiotics,” Hasina said. Discovered in the 1920s, antibiotics have saved tens of millions of lives by seeing off bacterial diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and meningitis.But over the decades, bacteria have learned to fight back, building resistance to the same drugs that once reliably vanquished them — turning into so-called “superbugs”.The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations said superbugs were already taking an heavy toll.“About 700,000 people globally die each year due to antimicrobial resistance,” the IFPMA said in a statement welcoming the new group.“Without strong action to ensure appropriate use of existing antibiotics, as well as new and better treatments, that figure could rise to 10 million by 2050.”Tedros said that while antibiotics are a key focus, antimicrobial resistance also included resistance to medicines for HIV, malaria and neglected tropical diseases.The Covid-19 pandemic was a “stark reminder” that human health cannot be advanced while disregarding the health of animals and the environment, he added.The novel coronavirus has killed at least 1.36 million people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, while nearly 56.9 million cases have been registered, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.Turning to the pandemic, Tedros said more cases had been reported in the past four weeks than in the first six months, while hospitals and their intensive care units were filling up across Europe and North America.“This week there has been more good news from vaccine trials which continues to give us hope of ending the pandemic,” he said.“At the same time, we must continue to use the tools we have to interrupt the chains of transmission and save lives now.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/what-are-clinical-trials-and-how-do-they-work/,Growing antimicrobial resistance as dangerous as pandemic: WHO,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — To find out whether experimental Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective, researchers design clinical trials involving thousands of volunteers, divided into groups that receive either the drug under investigation or a placebo.Data from such trials have shown that two vaccines — one developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, the other by Moderna and the US National Institutes of Health — are about 95 percent effective.Here’s a look at how trials work: American pharmaceutical Pfizer itself has led and financed a clinical trial of its vaccine involving almost 44,000 people in the United States, Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina.Volunteers who are accepted receive two doses 21 days apart and get regular follow-up.The Moderna-NIH vaccine is given 28-days-apart at locations across the US on some 30,000 volunteers, in a trial part funded by the taxpayer.The trials are “blinded” meaning neither the volunteers nor the health care providers know who gets the medicine and who gets a saline solution placebo. Volunteers have not been deliberately infected with the virus. This option, known as a challenge trial, was considered but deemed too risky given that there aren’t any Covid-19 treatments that are proven as highly-effective.Instead volunteers are expected to go about their lives as normal, and are given the same advice about mask use, distancing and hand washing as everyone else.Over the course of time, a certain number naturally become infected, and since they’re getting regular follow-up, the trial investigators quickly find out.If the vaccine is effective, the number of people who fall sick in the vaccine group should be lower than the number of people who get ill in the placebo group.The aim is to find a difference great enough to exclude the possibility it occurred by chance. Statistical methods come into play to achieve a predetermined level of certainty.It’s worth noting that the primary goal is to prevent people from getting sick, with good vaccines also protecting people from severe illness.Stopping people from getting infected at all, and thus being able to transmit the virus forward, is a secondary goal for Moderna.Moncef Slaoui, chief of the US government’s Operation Warp Speed, said Wednesday he expects the vaccines will achieve these goals too, though at a lower efficacy rate. The only way of knowing whether a vaccine works is by providing a “control”, which is a demonstration of what would happen in its absence.Of course, different people have different risk profiles in terms of their ages, underlying conditions, and how much risky behavior they engage in.That’s why the trials need to be scaled to tens of thousands of people to eliminate confounding factors. To ensure scientific rigor is upheld, the data is firewalled from the companies and analyzed by experts in a “data and safety monitoring board” whose membership is kept secret to prevent political pressure.Over the course of a trial, these committees will lift the hood on the data that’s been collected so far and see which patients belonged to which group.They can then inform the manufacturer in case of conclusive results and the manufacturer can then use the data, if it’s favorable, to apply for a marketing authorization.The boards also closely monitor safety, looking at the frequency and severity of side-effects, a key factor in determining regulatory approval. Pfizer’s efficacy analysis featured 170 people who fell sick with Covid-19 in the seven days following the second dose, which might seem like a small number of people compared to the total trial participants (44,000).But it’s enough to say the result is statistically significant with a high-degree of certainty.That’s because 162 people who fell ill were on the placebo, and only eight were in the vaccine group — a difference so great it’s extremely improbable to come about by chance.An efficacy of 95 percent signifies that the risk of catching Covid-19 is reduced by 95 percent in the vaccinated group compared to the placebo group. They will all be transferred to the vaccine arm — but it is still being decided when that will happen, said Slaoui.The Pfizer and Moderna trials will therefore lose their “control” groups, but the participants will still be followed for two more years to determine how long immunity lasts and whether there are longer-term safety effects.It will also make it harder to recruit new people to ongoing trials for vaccines that aren’t yet as close to applying for approval.©"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/can-surgical-masks-be-reused/,What are clinical trials and how do they work?,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Health authorities say the most widespread anti-Covid weapon — surgical masks — must be thrown away after a single use, but environmental concerns are pushing some scientists to question this recommendation.As the coronavirus continues to spread, masks have in many places become mandatory on public transport, in shops and at work.But cost has become an issue, as has the fact so many disposable plastic masks wind up in waterways and the oceans.One alternative is reusable cloth masks, but many people prefer single-use surgical masks because they are lighter and individually cheaper.“Medical masks are for single use only,” the World Health Organization has said. “Discard the mask immediately, preferably into a closed bin.”But faced with shortages during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in March and April, the WHO allowed in a June report for “exceptional procedures” to disinfect throw-away masks for reuse.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends — in emergency circumstances — hydrogen peroxide vapour to decontaminate the N95 masks worn by healthcare workers.Other methods to purify single-use masks include exposing them to high temperatures or ultraviolet radiation.But these methods are inconvenient for people at home, said French microbiologist and member of Adios Corona, Denis Corpet. Adios Corona — a group of scientists who provide information on Covid-19 to the public — recommends “placing the mask in a paper envelope with the date clearly marked, and leaving it for seven days”.“Several scientific studies show that viruses are almost all dead on a mask after seven days,” said Corpet.A study published in The Lancet found that only 0.1 percent of the virus on the outside surface of the mask was still detectable after one week.This method, however, is not appropriate for healthcare workers exposed to high viral loads.Peter Tsai, the inventor of N95 electrostatically charged filter material, agrees with the seven-day method.But he suggests leaving used masks out in the open for a week before reuse, a cycle he says can be repeated five to 10 times.Disposable masks can also be placed in the oven, Tsai told AFP, ideally at a temperature between 70 and 75 degrees Celsius (158 and 167 degrees Fahrenheit) — not too high to avoid burning the plastic, but sufficiently hot to kill the virus.Washing masks in a washing machine, however, is not a good idea.“Washing without detergent may not wash away the virus,” Tsai said. “And washing with detergent will erase the (electrostatic) charges,” diminishing its efficiency.French consumers’ rights group UFC-Que Choisir washed surgical masks at 60C, put them in the dryer, and ironed them. After 10 such cycles, the masks still filtered at least 90 percent of 3-micron particles.“Apart from a slight felting, the washed surgical masks were at least as efficient as the best cloth masks,” UFC-Que Choisir reported last week. Researcher Philippe Vroman from French engineering university Ensait came to the same conclusion.After five washes, “there are practically no differences (of filtration) for particles of 3 microns,” Vroman said, on the basis of preliminary results not yet published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.“And I would rather we swap masks every four hours and wash them, rather than wearing them several days in a row as some people do. It’s a bit like underwear,” he said.But not all scientists agree.“Washing the mask at home could potentially cause a secondary contamination and spread the virus if washing is not set appropriately,” said Kaiming Ye, head of the biomedical engineering department at New York’s Binghamton University.Until more research is published on the matter, official advice from health authorities is not set to change.“Single-use surgical masks must be thrown into the bin after use,” said France’s health authority DGS, but noted that more studies were underway."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/in-new-breakthrough-modernas-covid-vaccine-nearly-95-effective/,Can surgical masks be reused?,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — US biotech firm Moderna on Monday announced its experimental vaccine against Covid-19 was almost 95 percent effective, a result hailed by the country’s top infectious disease scientist as “stunningly impressive.”Moderna’s early results from a clinical trial with more than 30,000 participants marks a second major breakthrough in the quest to end the pandemic.Last week, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech aid their vaccine was 90 percent effective.Both frontrunners are based on new technology that uses synthetic versions of molecules called “messenger RNA” to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.“The idea that we have a 94.5 percent effective vaccine is stunningly impressive,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, which co-developed the vaccine, told AFP.“It is really a spectacular result that I don’t think anybody had anticipated would be this good.”“Today’s news of a second vaccine is further reason to feel hopeful,” tweeted President-elect Joe Biden, but he cautioned that its widespread distribution was months away.“Until then, Americans need to continue to practice social-distancing and mask-wearing to get the virus under control,” he said.Moderna plans to submit applications for emergency approval around the world within weeks, and says it expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the US by the end of the year.The company, which has received $2 billion from the US government under “Operation Warp Speed,” added it is on track to manufacture between 500 million to a billion doses globally in 2021.Global infections from Covid-19 have soared past 54 million with more than 1.3 million deaths since the virus emerged in China late last year.President Donald Trump also weighed in on Twitter, to take credit: “Please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!” Moncef Slaoui, who leads Operation Warp Speed, told MSNBC he hoped the two vaccines would be approved “somewhere towards in the first half of December,” with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine the next on the horizon early next year.The Moderna vaccine is given in two doses 28 days apart, and the preliminary results are based on the 95 of the 30,000 volunteers who fell ill with Covid-19.Of the 95, 90 had been in the trial’s placebo group, and five in the group that received the drug, called mRNA-1273, translating to an efficacy rate of 94.5 percent.There were 11 people who fell severely ill, all of whom were in the placebo group.A small fraction of people experienced severe symptoms such as fatigue, muscle and joint pains, or redness at the injection site, but these side-effects were short lasting.Fauci said the next major step was convincing enough people to take the vaccine, particularly in the United States, where anti-vaccine sentiment runs high. “You’ve got to overcome that and convince people to get vaccinated because a vaccine with a high degree of efficacy is of no use if nobody gets vaccinated,” he said.Crucially, Moderna also announced that its vaccine can remain stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees Fahrenheit to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for 30 days.The company added it could be kept in long-term storage at standard freezer temperatures of -20 degrees Celsius for up to six months.Pfizer’s vaccine, on the other hand, needs to be stored in deep-freezer conditions of -70 degrees Celsius, which could complicate supply chain logistics, particularly in less developed countries. The promising results of both vaccines are seen as a validation for mRNA technology, which has never before been brought to regulatory approval but has the potential to transform the field.Fauci said that another piece of good news was that the Moderna-NIH vaccine appears to work equally well in the elderly and across ethnic groups.But it is not yet clear how long-lasting the protection will be from either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines.Another open question is whether they stop people who are exposed to the virus from transmitting it on to the other people, even though they may be themselves protected from the disease."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/sanofi-says-its-vaccine-wont-need-supercooling/,In new breakthrough,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — The coronavirus vaccine being developed by Sanofi won’t need to be super-cooled and a normal refrigerator will suffice, the Paris-based drugmaker’s France chief Olivier Bogillot said Sunday.His comments came days after American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced that their vaccine had proven 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials involving more than 40,000 people.The companies said they expect to supply up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.However, Pfizer’s vaccine must be stored at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit) or else it falls apart, well beyond the capability of most hospital freezers let alone domestic appliances.Rachel Silverman, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, has already warned that maintaining the Pfizer vaccine’s “ultra-cold chain” from factory to patients’ arms constitutes “an enormous logistical challenge even in the West”.“Our vaccine will be like the ‘flu vaccine, you can keep it in your refrigerator,” this avoiding the problem, Bogillot told the CNews channel.“This will be an advantage for some countries,” he added.The Sanofi vaccine, one of many in development, will be available for distribution next June, Bogillot added.The results of the Phase 2 tests, involving hundreds of people, will be made public in early December, he added. If those results are positive then Phase 3 trials involving thousands of people will begin, alongside mass production.Eleven of the vaccines under development have already begun Phase 3 trials.The Pfizer vaccine is “a little more advanced” in the development process, said Bogillot, but “one laboratory is not going to be able to supply the doses for the whole planet.“We will need to have several winners at the end of this race.”The Sanofi product will also be made avaiable at an “affordable” price he said, without giving details."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/frontrunners-emerge-in-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/,Moderna’s Covid vaccine nearly 95% effective,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Dozens of companies, from biotech start-ups to Big Pharma, are racing to develop a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine, both to meet urgent medical need and for the potential payday.Here’s an update on the quest for a magic bullet against the coronavirus that has already killed more than a million people worldwide.The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 42 “candidate vaccines” at the stage of clinical trials, up from 11 in mid-June.Ten of them are at the most advanced “phase 3” stage, in which a vaccine’s effectiveness is tested on a large scale, generally tens of thousands of people across several continents.Earlier this month a US-German collaboration between Pfizer and BioNTech scored a major breakthrough by announcing the results of its phase 3 trial for its mRNA vaccine.It said the vaccine had proven 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 symptoms and did not produce adverse side effects among thousands of volunteers.Pfizer is currently seeking Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and expects to roll out initial doses imminently, with a total of 1.3 billion doses to be administered by the end of next year.On Monday US biotech firm Moderna said its vaccine was almost 95 percent effective.Moderna plans to submit applications for emergency approval in the US and around the world within weeks, and says it expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the US by the end of the year.It says it’s on track to manufacture between 500 million to a billion doses globally in 2021.In addition, several state-run Chinese labs and a European project led by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca are thought to be among the more promising candidate vaccines.Russia has already registered two Covid-19 vaccines, even before clinical trials were completed.Some methods for making a vaccine are tried-and-true, while others remain experimental.Inactivated “classic” vaccines use a virus germ that has been killed, while others use a weakened or “attenuated” strain that is virulent enough to provoke antibodies but not to cause disease.So-called “sub-unit” vaccines contain a fragment of the pathogen they are derived from to produce an appropriate immune response.“Viral vector” varieties use other forms of live virus to deliver DNA into human cells, triggering an immune response.A measles virus modified with a coronavirus protein, for example, can be deployed against Covid-19.Both Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines are based on new technology that uses synthetic versions of molecules called messenger RNA to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.Trials of two candidate vaccines — made by Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly — were “paused” recently over safety concerns.But that is not necessarily bad news, said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.“The fact that trials are paused should indicate that there should be confidence that the whole process of monitoring the safety of trial participants is working well,” he said.Recent cases in which recovered Covid patients were infected a second time with a new strain also raise the question of how long vaccines might last.In October, the US FDA said it would need to see two months of follow up data after vaccination before giving emergency authorisation for any vaccine use.“What is different for Covid-19 vaccines is that speed of development and potential approval is much faster due to the public health emergency,” noted the European Medicines Agency (EMA).But even that pressing need cannot overcome the rules.“Before approval, all vaccines in the European Union are evaluated against the same high standards as any other medicine,” the EMA said in a statement.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-19-vaccine-best-science-news-of-2020/,Sanofi says its vaccine won’t need supercooling,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — Data indicating that a vaccine being developed against Covid-19 is highly effective is the “best science news of the year”, a pharmaceutical industry association chief said, voicing hope that other vaccine candidates would show equally good results.“A vaccine that has 90 percent efficacy and is pretty safe, that is a historic breakthrough,” the head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), Thomas Cueni, said.American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced Monday that their vaccine had proven 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials involving more than 40,000 people.“This was the best science news of the year,” IFPMA’s director general told AFP in an interview.Hopes are also high that one or several of the vaccines under development will also help rein in the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed nearly 1.3 million people out of the over 51.5 million infected.There are currently more than 40 candidate vaccines against Covid-19 being tested on humans, with a handful in the most advanced Phase 3 trials.Cueni acknowledged that more data was needed on the Pfizer and BioNTech candidate, which is based on an innovative technology that has never been approved for use before.The companies based their announcement on interim results from the last step in their clinical trial before officially applying for approval.Cueni voiced confidence that any major safety concerns with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine would have been known.“We still need to see the (full) efficacy and the safety data,” Cueni said, but stressed: “There is now genuine reason for optimism that these vaccines are basically considered safe.”He said there is still a long list of unknowns about the vaccine’s protection, including whether it will be equally effective in all age groups and how long the protection might last.Another pressing question is whether it will not only protect a person from Covid-19 infection but also prevent that person from transmitting the virus.But Cueni said the data so far indicated the vaccine candidate was far more effective in preventing Covid-19 infections than the 50-percent efficacy threshold required by some regulators before considering authorisation.This was “big news”, he said, particularly “since I think there is reason to hope it won’t be the only one.”“We will see more good results.”Cueni said safety and efficacy data on at least four other vaccine candidates, being developed by Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax and Johnson & Johnson, would be known within the next few months.He was optimistic that enough data would soon be available to win approval for using one or more of the Covid-19 vaccines.And the large developers had already scaled up their manufacturing capacities, and were each in a position to produce upwards of a billion doses next year, he said.But Cueni acknowledged there were numerous logistical challenges to actually inoculating the huge numbers of people it would take to bring the pandemic to a halt.And he voiced concern about high levels of vaccine hesitancy in many countries.Pharmaceutical companies were taking that challenge particularly seriously, he said, insisting they were going “way above and beyond the normal regulatory requirements” in terms transparency and data-sharing from trials.The industry understood the importance of ensuring any authorised vaccine is trusted, he said.“This is not only about Covid-19.”Without trust, “the negative spillover on vaccination overall would be disastrous.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/planes-dry-ice-pharmacies-the-logistical-challenges-of-covid-19-vaccines/,Frontrunners emerge in race for Covid-19 vaccine,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The United States could be the first country to launch one of the most ambitious vaccine operations in history: distributing and administering up to 600 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine in just a few months.Massive vaccine campaigns are nothing new — they have been carried out for decades in the fight against the measles and flu, for example.But stamping out the coronavirus is a distinctly new challenge due to three factors: the short time frame for inoculating a huge number of people, the fact that most vaccines will require two doses, and the very low temperature at which some of the vaccines must be stored.The vaccine developed by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech, on track to be the first authorized for use in the United States, must be stored at -94 degrees Fahrenheit (-70 degrees Celsius), whereas the flu vaccine can be kept in a normal refrigerator.Pfizer vaccines distributed in the US will come from its largest manufacturing plant located in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Their ship-out will include a precise, clockwork-like dance of containers, trucks and planes.Thermal shipping containers will each be filled with dry ice and 975 vials of the vaccine which each contain five doses, for a total of 4,875 doses.Every day six trucks will take the doses to air carriers such as FedEx, UPS or DHL, which will deliver them across the United States in one to two days and across the globe in three, Pfizer told AFP.The company expects an average of 20 daily cargo flights worldwide.FedEx had to obtain special permission from civil aviation authorities to transport so much dry ice, which could pose a danger to the crew should it accidentally undergo “sublimation” and pass from a solid to a gas, the company told AFP.Once the boxes have reached their final destination, they can be opened only briefly just two times a day.“To run a large mass vaccination clinic, it’s fine,” said Julie Swann, a pandemic response expert at North Carolina State University.But the vaccine would not be suitable for distribution at doctors’ offices or pharmacies, which are too small, she warned.At least in the beginning Americans will have to go to hospitals or maybe even large distribution centers set up in parking lots much like Covid test sites, she said.The vaccines can remain in their boxes for two weeks meaning hospitals will not need a special freezer.“We’re not recommending at this time that hospitals or clinics purchase ultra cold equipment,” said Janell Routh of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. US biotech giant Moderna is also manufacturing a vaccine, which can be stored at -4 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of a normal freezer.The US government is organizing a free distribution of this vaccine to US states and territories, with each jurisdiction to decide how to distribute the doses to hospitals, pharmacies, doctors or even universities and companies will distribute the doses, in a decentralized system much like what was used for the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009.“The federal government does not intend, with very, very few exceptions, to touch a single dose of vaccine before it goes into the arm of Americans,” said Paul Mango, an Operation Warp Speed official, during a briefing.The objective is to offer vaccines to the most vulnerable populations before the end of December, to healthcare workers before the end of January and all Americans by the beginning of April.Pfizer expects to produce 50 million doses this year and 1.3 billion in 2021: The United States has already ordered 100 million total including 20-30 million for delivery before the end of December. The European Union meanwhile has ordered 200 million, Japan 120 million, Britain 30 million and Canada 20 million.Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi and others are hoping their own vaccines will also prove safe and effective, and their global rollout will follow suit.Carrier DHL estimates that 15 million cooling boxes would need to be delivered over the next two years, with approximately 15,000 flights needed worldwide.Poorer countries that lack storage capacity for large quantites of vaccines that need super-cold storage have little hope of benefiting from the first doses, said Prashant Yadav, an expert in global health supply chains at the Center for Global Development.Ultracold freezers that can reach temperatures of -112 degrees Fahrenheit cost five times more than standard freezers and are only made to order, he said. © Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/russia-says-sputnik-v-virus-vaccine-92-effective/,Russia says Sputnik V virus vaccine 92% effective,1,"MOSCOW, Russia (AFP) — Russia’s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine is 92 percent effective according to initial test results, its developers said on Wednesday, as Moscow races against its competitors in the West.The calculations were based on results from 16,000 individuals who received both doses of the vaccine, Russia’s health ministry, the state-run Gamaleya research centre and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said in a statement.“The Sputnik V vaccine had an efficacy rate of 92 percent after the second dose,” the statement said, after 20 of the volunteers — some of whom were given the placebo — tested positive for coronavirus.The adenovirus vector-based vaccine uses modified viruses of the regular flu.Some of those vaccinated experienced “pain at the injection site, flu-like syndrome including fever, weakness, fatigue and headache,” the statement said.Russia in August became the first country to register a coronavirus vaccine but did so ahead of the large-scale clinical trials that are still underway.Forty thousand volunteers at 29 medical centres are taking part in the third and final phase of Sputnik V trials.In September, the vaccine was separately administered to medics and other at-risk people working in Russian hospitals, demonstrating an efficacy rate of “over 90 percent,” the statement said.Regional authorities in Siberia’s Altai region on Tuesday said that at least three medics out of the 42 that received the vaccine had contracted the virus.Wednesday’s statement added that the interim research data will be published in one of the world’s “leading peer-reviewed medical academic journals”.Observation of trial participants will continue for six months, after which the full clinical trial report will be presented, it added.The statement said that RDIF, which is funding development of Sputnik V, will provide research data to countries that are interested in purchasing the Russian vaccine.Overseas trials are also taking place in the UAE, Venezuela, Belarus and other countries, the statement said.The announcement of Sputnik V’s interim results comes days after Western vaccine developers Pfizer and BioNTech said that their vaccine was more than 90 percent effective."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-grants-emergency-approval-to-lilly-covid-19-antibodies/,US grants emergency approval to Lilly Covid-19 antibodies,1,"WASHINGTON, United (AFP) — The US Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted emergency approval to a synthetic antibody treatment against Covid-19 developed by Eli Lilly, after the drug was shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization and emergency room visits.Bamlanivimab at a dose of 700 milligrams was authorized for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in adults and children aged 12 years and older who are at high risk for progressing to the severe form of the disease.It is the first major drug to be approved that was designed specifically against the new coronavirus.“As illustrated by today’s action, the FDA remains committed to expediting the development and availability of potential COVID-19 treatments,” said the agency’s chief Stephen Hahn.The approval was based on a mid-stage clinical trial for outpatients with mild to moderate Covid-19, where the intravenous treatment was shown to reduce viral loads and rates of symptoms and hospitalization.The FDA said in its statement that the most important evidence that bamlanivimab may be effective came from data that showed that among patients at high risk of severe disease, hospitalizations and emergency room visits occurred in 3 percent of bamlanivimab-treated patients compared to 10 percent who were on the placebo.The frequency and types of side effects were similar between bamlanivimab and placebo, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity.The most common were diarrhea, dizziness, headache, itchiness and vomiting.The trial is ongoing and aims to enroll more than 800 patients across various dosage groups.An important caveat is that bamlanivimab has not been authorized for patients who are hospitalized — since no benefit has been shown for patients who are already in this late stage of the disease, when the body’s immune defenses go into overdrive and damage organs.The FDA wrote that administering the drug too late could be associated with worse outcomes, and a trial exploring bamlanivimab in hospitalized patients was suspended last month over a safety incident.Bamlanivimab is what’s known as a monoclonal antibody, a relatively new class of drugs that are best known for treating certain types of cancer and autoimmune disease.Human immune systems produce antibodies, which are infection-fighting proteins, and vaccines teach our bodies to be prepared to make the right ones for particular pathogens.Bamlanivimab was based on an effective antibody Lilly found in a recovered patient.The host immune cells that produce the antibodies can be cultured in a lab to produce the desired proteins en masse.It works by binding to a surface protein of the coronavirus to stop it from invading human cells."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/canada-reports-rare-strain-of-swine-flu-found-in-a-human/,Canada reports rare strain of swine flu found in a human,1,"MONTREAL, Canada (AFP) — Canadian health authorities on Wednesday reported the country’s first case of a human infected with the H1N2 virus, a rare strain of swine flu.The case, detected in the western province of Alberta in mid-October, appears to be isolated “and there is no increased risk to Albertans at this time,” local health officials said in a statement.“This is the only influenza case reported in Alberta so far this flu season,” the statement read.It added that the unnamed patient experienced mild influenza-like symptoms, “was tested and then quickly recovered. There is no evidence at this time that the virus has spread further.”Canadian health officials are looking into where the virus came from, and to verify that it has not spread.Since 2005 only 27 cases worldwide have been reported of people infected with the H1N2 — not to be confused with the more common H1N1 swine flu virus. There have been no cases in Canada prior to this one.The H1N2 strain is not a food-related illness and it is not transmissible to humans by eating pork or other pig products, officials said.“This a rare type of flu in humans, typically acquired from exposure to infected pigs and not known to spread easily from human to human,” Theresa Tam, Chief Public Health Officer of Canada, wrote on Twitter."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/vaccine-trials-cant-detect-virus-risk-reduction-expert/,Vaccine trials ‘can’t detect’ virus risk reduction: expert,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — None of the trials of Covid-19 candidate vaccines can detect a reduction in serious outcomes such as hospitalization or death, a leading public health expert said Thursday.Writing in the BMJ medical journal, associate editor Peter Doshi warned that not even phase 3 trials under way in the race for a vaccine can prove their product will prevent people contracting Covid-19.In a sobering essay, Doshi said those hoping for a breakthrough to end the pandemic would be disappointed, with some vaccines likely to reduce the risk of Covid-19 infection by only 30 percent.“None of the trials currently under way are designed to detect a reduction in any serious outcome such as hospital admissions, use of intensive care, or deaths,” he wrote.“Nor are the vaccines being studied to determine whether they can interrupt transmission of the virus.”The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 42 candidate vaccines in clinical trials, ten of which are in the most advanced “phase 3” stage.This is where a vaccine’s effectiveness is tested on a large scale, generally tens of thousands of people across several continents.But Doshi, assistant professor of pharmaceutical health services research at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, said that even the most advanced trials are evaluating mild rather than severe disease.This may be down to the numbers of people involved in trials, he said, pointing out that the majority of confirmed Covid-19 infections involve mild or no symptoms.And few if any current trials are designed to find out whether there is a benefit among the elderly, a key at-risk constituency.Without enrolling frail and elderly volunteers in trials in sufficient numbers, Doshi said “there can be little basis for assuming any benefit against hospitalization or mortality.He added that children, immunocompromised people and pregnant women had largely been excluded from trials, making it unlikely that the experiments will address key gaps in our understanding of how Covid-19 develops differently among individuals.– 30% risk reduction – Several trials have already been halted after participants became ill.Many countries plan to prioritize vulnerable people once a vaccine is available, but Doshi said that those hoping for a miracle end to the pandemic would have to wait.He said that several pharmaceutical firms had designed their studies “to detect a relative risk reduction of at least 30 percent in participants developing laboratory-confirmed Covid-19”.Recent studies have also confirmed that it is possible for someone to be reinfected with Covid-19, a development that may impact how governments’ form their vaccination plans.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/bottle-fed-babies-ingest-millions-of-microplastics-study/,Bottle-fed babies ingest ‘millions’ of microplastics: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Bottle-fed babies may ingest more than a million pieces of microplastics each day, new research showed Monday highlighting the abundance of plastics in our food products.There is growing evidence that humans consume huge numbers of the tiny particles, formed when larger pieces of plastic break down, but very little is known about the knock-on health consequences.Researchers in Ireland looked at the rate of microplastic release in 10 types of baby bottles or accessories made from polypropylene, the most commonly used plastic for food containers.They followed official guidelines from the World Health Organization on sterilisation and formula preparation conditions.Over a 21-day test period, the team found that the bottles released between 1.3 and 16.2 million plastic microparticles per litre.They then used this data to model the potential global infant exposure to microplastics from bottle-feeding, based on national average rates of breast-feeding.They estimated that the average bottle-fed baby could be ingesting 1.6 million plastic microparticles every day during the first 12 months of their lives.The authors of the research, published in the Nature Food journal, said that sterilisation and exposure to high water temperatures had the biggest effect on microplastic release, going from 0.6 million particles per litre on average at 25C to 55 million/litre at 95C.The authors told AFP that the aim of the research was “not to worry parents” about the potential health risks of bottle microplastics.“We have communicated, as strongly as we can, that we do not know the potential health risks of infant ingestions of microplastics,” said the team, from Trinity College Dublin.“This is an area of research we are now actively pursuing.”The authors noted that it was in developed nations that babies were likely ingesting the most plastic — 2.3 million particles daily in North America and 2.6 million in Europe.This was attributed to relatively low breast-feeding rates in richer countries.They said the levels could easily be lowered by taking a few additional steps, including rinsing bottles with cold sterilised water and preparing formula milk in a non-plastic container before filling the bottle.Fay Couceiro, Senior Research Fellow in Biogeochemistry, University of Portsmouth, said Monday’s research highlighted the “urgency for studies on microplastic impacts on human health”.She said that it was important not to be “alarmist” when it came to bottle feeding, which many parents prefer for a variety of reasons.“The risks from not sterilising bottles or using hot water are well understood and very real, and these known risks of disease must outweigh that of microplastic production until their health risks are understood,” said Couceiro, who was not involved in the study.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/uk-researchers-aim-to-infect-volunteers-to-study-covid-exposure/,UK researchers aim to infect volunteers to study Covid exposure,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — British researchers on Tuesday said they hope to expose healthy volunteers to the virus that causes Covid-19 in a groundbreaking study to discover the amount needed for people to become infected.The Human Challenge Programme — a partnership that includes Imperial College London — hopes the work will ultimately help to “reduce the spread of the coronavirus, mitigate its impact and reduce deaths”.In what researchers called a world first, the opening stage of the project will examine the possibility of exposing healthy volunteers to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.They aim to recruit volunteers between the ages of 18 and 30 with no underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or obesity.“In this initial phase, the aim will be to discover the smallest amount of virus it takes to cause a person to develop Covid-19,” Imperial College said in a statement.The volunteer would be infected via the nose, Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial, told BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday.“The great advantage of these volunteer studies is that we can look at each volunteer very carefully not only during the infection but also prior to infection, and we can work out exactly what’s going on at every stage,” he added.The researchers would use the results to study how vaccines might work and to explore potential treatments.Because the study deliberately infects the volunteers, “it should be possible for scientists to begin to establish efficacy very quickly, by testing if those who have had a vaccine are less likely to become infected with the virus”, explained the researchers.“Our number one priority is the safety of the volunteers,” said Chris Chiu, from Imperial’s department of infectious disease.“No study is completely risk free, but the Human Challenge Programme partners will be working hard to ensure we make the risks as low as we possibly can.”“The UK’s experience and expertise in human challenge trials as well as in wider COVID-19 science will help us tackle the pandemic, benefiting people in the UK and worldwide,” he added.The study is expected to begin early next year, said the research team from the partnership, which also includes the government, a clinical company and a hospital."

This means we may know whether or not our vaccine is effective by the end of October,” Bourla said.Pfizer, which is partnering with German company BioNTech on the research, gained more than two percent in online trading ahead of the opening of US markets."

For other pathogens, immunity may be fleeting at best.The authors said the US patient could have been exposed to a very high dose of the virus the second time around, triggering a more acute reaction.Alternatively, it may have been a more virulent strain of the virus.Another hypothesis is a mechanism known as antibody dependent enhancement — that is, when antibodies actually make subsequent infections worse, such as with dengue fever.The researchers pointed out that reinfection of any kind remains rare, with only a handful of confirmed cases out of tens of millions of Covid-19 infections globally.However, since many cases are asymptomatic and therefore unlikely to have tested positive initially, it may be impossible to know if a given Covid-19 case is the first or second infection.In a linked comment to The Lancet paper, Akiko Iwasaka, a professor of Immunobiology and Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at Yale University, said the findings could impact public health measures.“As more cases of reinfection surface, the scientific community will have the opportunity to understand better the correlates of protection and how frequently natural infections with SARS-CoV-2 induce that level of immunity,” she said.“This information is key to understanding which vaccines are capable of crossing that threshold to confer individual and herd immunity,” added Iwasaka, who was not involved in the study.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/coronavirus-can-survive-for-28-days-on-surfaces-study/,Coronavirus ‘can survive for 28 days on surfaces’: study,1,"BRISBANE, Australia (AFP) — The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 can survive on items such as banknotes and phones for up to 28 days in cool, dark conditions, according to a study by Australia’s national science agency.Researchers at CSIRO’s disease preparedness centre tested the longevity of SARS-CoV-2 in the dark at three temperatures, showing survival rates decreased as conditions became hotter, the agency said Monday.The scientists found that at 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit), SARS-CoV-2 was “extremely robust” on smooth surfaces — like mobile phone screens — surviving for 28 days on glass, steel and plastic banknotes.At 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), the survival rate dropped to seven days and plunged to just 24 hours at 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).The virus survived for shorter periods on porous surfaces such as cotton — up to 14 days at the lowest temperatures and less than 16 hours at the highest — the researchers said.This was “significantly longer” than previous studies which found the disease could survive for up to four days on non-porous surfaces, according to the paper published in the peer-reviewed Virology Journal.Trevor Drew, director of the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness, said the study involved drying samples of the virus on different materials before testing them, using an “extremely sensitive” method that found traces of live virus able to infect cell cultures.“This doesn’t mean to say that that amount of virus would be capable of infecting someone,” he told public broadcaster ABC.He added that if a person was “careless with these materials and touched them and then licked your hands or touched your eyes or your nose, you might well get infected upwards of two weeks after they had been contaminated”.Drew said there were several caveats including that the study was conducted with fixed levels of virus that likely represented the peak of a typical infection, and there was an absence of exposure to ultraviolet light, which can rapidly degrade the virus.Humidity was kept steady at 50 percent, the study said, as increases in humidity have also been found as detrimental to the virus.According to the CSIRO, the virus appears to primarily spread through the air but more research was needed to provide further insights into the transmission of the virus via surfaces.“While the precise role of surface transmission, the degree of surface contact and the amount of virus required for infection is yet to be determined, establishing how long this virus remains viable on surfaces is critical for developing risk mitigation strategies in high contact areas,” CSIRO’s Debbie Eagles said.The main message remains that “infectious people are far, far more infectious than surfaces”, Drew told the ABC.“But nevertheless, it may help to explain why even when we got rid of the infectious people, we do occasionally get these breakouts again, sometimes even in a country which is considered to be free,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/mental-health-toll-of-pandemic-devastating-who/,Mental health toll of pandemic ‘devastating’: WHO,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The Covid-19 pandemic is having a “devastating impact” on mental health services globally, the World Health Organization said Monday, ahead of a large fundraising push. It warned that mental health had been overlooked in the crisis, pointing to a survey conducted between June and August that revealed severe disruptions to services in 93 countries.While 83 percent of the 130 countries surveyed had included mental health in their coronavirus pandemic response plans only 17 percent had actually set up the full funding required, it said.“This is a forgotten aspect of Covid-19,” WHO mental health director Devora Kestel told a virtual media briefing, stressing the urgent need for increased funding.Before the pandemic, countries were spending less than two percent of their national health budget on mental health, and were struggling to meet demand, the WHO said.That demand has now dramatically increased due to the pandemic.“Bereavement, isolation, loss of income and fear are triggering mental health conditions or exacerbating existing ones,” the agency said in a statement.“Many people may be facing increased levels of alcohol and drug use, insomnia, and anxiety.”– Prevention programmes hit first – Though all regions of the world have been affected, high-income nations had been better able to maintain the provision of services.WHO’s survey found that 30 percent of countries reported some disruption in emergency mental health provision and medication supplies for people with disorders.Prevention services were sharply affected while travel restrictions hindered patient access to health facilities.However, countries are learning to respond with innovative solutions such as telemedicine and teletherapy interventions.The WHO also said more data was needed on Covid-19’s effect on brain health, with fewer than one in 10 countries conducting research.The WHO said that estimates before the coronavirus pandemic showed that nearly $1.0 trillion in economic productivity was lost annually from depression and anxiety alone.However, studies showed that every dollar spent on evidence-based care for depression and anxiety returned $5.00.On Saturday, the WHO is hosting on social media “The Big Event for Mental Health”, calling for increased investment.Those taking part include Queen Mathilde of the Belgians; footballer Alisson Becker, the Brazil and Liverpool goalkeeper; and pop star Lady Gaga’s mother Cynthia Germanotta.Also involved are the widow of Chester Bennington, the Linkin Park singer who committed suicide in 2017, and Klas Bergling, the father of the Swedish superstar DJ Avicii, who was found dead two years ago aged 28."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/second-russian-virus-vaccine-passes-early-trials-report/,Second Russian virus vaccine passes early trials: report,1,"MOSCOW, Russia (AFP) — Early clinical trials of a second Russian coronavirus vaccine have proved successful, its developer said Thursday after Russia boasted of approving the world’s first vaccine.Russia’s Vektor — a top-secret state virology research centre in Siberia — said that early-stage trials were successful for its own experimental vaccine, named EpiVacCorona.“The first two phases of clinical trials demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of the EpiVacCorona vaccine,” Vektor’s press department told the Interfax news agency.Russia announced in August that it had developed the world’s first registered vaccine — named “Sputnik V” after the world’s first satellite.It raised concerns among Western scientists by announcing that the vaccine — developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya research centre — had received approval before full clinical trials have been completed.Vektor said it would be possible to make the final conclusions about the efficacy of its vaccine, based on peptides that trigger an immune response, after post-approval clinical trials have been completed.Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko told President Vladimir Putin this week that Vektor’s vaccine could be approved by the ministry in three weeks.Vektor said post-registration clinical trials would begin on 5,000 volunteers in Siberia.The lab said there would be a separate clinical trial involving 150 volunteers who are over 60 years of age.After that Vektor will begin placebo-controlled trials on 5,000 Russian volunteers between the ages of 18 and 60.The EpiVacCorona vaccine is a two-component vaccine, and the interval between the administration of the first and second components is 21 days.Russia plans to manufacture an initial 10,000 doses, Vektor said, with production expected to begin in November.Vektor declined to comment when contacted by AFP and referred all queries to Rospotrebnadzor, the country’s consumer safety watchdog.The watchdog declined immediate comment.The Vektor laboratory complex conducted secret biological weapons research in the Soviet era and stockpiles viruses ranging from Ebola to smallpox. It is located outside the Siberian city of Novosibirsk."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/flying-doctors-uk-air-ambulance-tests-paramedic-jet-suit/,Flying doctors: UK air ambulance tests paramedic jet suit,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — Emergency responders and engineers in Britain said on Tuesday they have successfully tested “the world’s first jet suit paramedic”, which could transform how life-savers reach isolated casualty sites.The Great North Air Ambulance Service (GNAAS), which provides emergency air response across swathes of northern England, said it had helped flight-test the 1,050 bhp (brake horsepower) jet suit in the Lake District National Park.The trial saw Richard Browning, the founder of Gravity Industries which has pioneered the technology, fly from the bottom of a valley up to a simulated casualty site in 90 seconds — compared to a 25-minute response time on foot.Video of the simulated exercise shows Browning, wearing a helmet, goggles and red flight suit equipped with a jet pack-style device, powering off the ground and zooming through the air just above the surface of the rocky terrain.Andy Mawson, GNAAS director of operations, said the charity chose the test location based on its call-out data and had little idea how the tech would fare in the real world.“We’ve seen it now and it is, quite honestly, awesome,” he said in a statement.Mawson added that at a time of strained healthcare provision because of the coronavirus pandemic, it was “important to still push the boundaries”.“We think this technology could enable our team to reach some patients much quicker than ever before,” he said.“In many cases this would ease the patient’s suffering. In some cases, it would save their lives.”GNAAS, which responds to more than 1,500 call-outs a year and relies on donations to fund its operations, said the successful test flight was the culmination of a year of discussion with Gravity Industries.The charity was “now exploring the next steps in this collaboration,” it said.Browning said it was “wonderful” to have tested his “Gravity Jet Suit” with active emergency responders.“We are just scratching the surface in terms of what is possible to achieve with our technology,” he added.“Emergency response is one of the areas Gravity (Industries) are actively pursuing.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/5g-networks-are-there-health-risks/,5G networks: are there health risks?,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Do 5G mobile telephones and networks pose health risks? Worries about the effect the technology has on humans and the environment have persisted as it has been deployed in various countries. What do scientists have to say about it? 5G networks are touted as promising an exponential leap in the amount and speed of wireless data, enabling advances in self-driving vehicles, virtual reality, connected health and more as sensors and servers communicate instantly.To get that speed, 5G uses higher frequencies than current networks. The trade off with higher frequencies is that their signals don’t travel as far and are easily blocked by buildings. This means more antennae will be needed to link up with phones.This is what concerns some people, who were already skittish about the giant antennae placed on top of towers and building. 5G networks will use many smaller antennae placed closer to people, such as on top of streetlights, potentially exposing people to even more radio waves. Mobile phones are not the only equipment to emit radio waves. TVs, radios, Wi-Fi are all also sources of exposure.The World Health Organization notes concern about such exposure but says: “To date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies.”It does acknowledge that only a few studies have looked at the frequencies to be used by 5G.There are still concerns about the long-term use of mobile phones close to your head possibly increasing cancer risk, with the WHO recommending in 2011 using hands-free devices.There are concerns that mobile phones, tablets and connected toys could have effects on the cognitive ability of children, with France’s ANSES safety agency recommending in 2016 limits to their exposure. When radio waves hit the body their principal biological effect is to heat body tissue.“Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body,” the WHO says on its website.“Provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated,” it adds.But according to ANSES expert Olivier Merckel, “studies have shown biological effects in certain very specific parameters such as sleep and stress.”But there is an enormous difference between a biological effect — when an organism responds to the environment — and determining that it poses a health risk. It is a distinction that often gets lost in public debate.The determination of a health risk is made after observing whether the human body is capable of adapting to cumulative effects of exposure. The lack of information on higher frequencies that are to be used by 5G means it is an area that France’s ANSES and other researchers are looking into.5G networks are currently using frequencies close to those of Wi-Fi boxes, but they will eventually use much higher frequencies.And as the frequency increases, radio waves are less able to penetrate the body, with absorbtion limited to the skin and eyes.ANSES’s Merckel said “this poses different questions in terms of potential health effects.”In 2012, ANSES evaluated airport body scanners, which use similar frequencies, and found they pose no health risks.But even if the frequencies are close, the usage is different. With the deployment of 5G networks both users and non-users are likely to be exposed to varying amounts of radio waves on a more or less permanent basis."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/chinese-company-targets-global-sales-with-quick-covid-19-tests/,Chinese company targets global sales with quick Covid-19 tests,1,"BEIJING, China (AFP) — A Chinese company is entering the global race to help defeat the coronavirus, promising its testing machine will return results faster than a lab and more reliably than at-home screening kits.The Flash 20 “is currently the fastest machine in the world for PCR tests for the new coronavirus”, says Sabrina Li, founder of the company Coyote.PCR tests are the industry standard and a major weapon against a pandemic that has now killed more than a million people and eviscerated the global economy.As governments scramble to develop adequate response systems, Li is targeting global sales.Already used at hospitals and airports in China, the contraption can process four samples in one go and deliver results in just half an hour.It has been certified by the European Union and Australia, and Coyote is seeking similar status from the United States and World Health Organization.Testing has been hailed as one of the best weapons to contain the pandemic and other researchers are also on the quest to find the fastest method.On Monday US President Donald Trump announced the distribution of 150 million rapid coronavirus tests that can deliver a result in 15-30 minutes.Different to PCR tests, these rapid diagnostic kits offer a quick turnaround, but are less sensitive and more likely to return false negatives.The makers of the Flash 20 say their machine, about the size of a printer, is not only fast but extremely reliable.Past experience with major disease outbreaks helped Coyote respond quickly this time around, the company said.The SARS epidemic of 2003-2004 jolted China’s biotechnology sector and led to a great “reorganisation” in the way the industry works, Zang Yuepeng, Coyote’s technical manager responsible for the Flash 20, told AFP.So when Covid-19 emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, Coyote was able to design the machine and “very quickly put this product on the market”.Between February and July, 500,000 tests were carried out in China by the authorities using the Flash 20, and the results were 97 percent the same as those returned by conventional PCR testing in a lab.The company can currently produce only 500 a month but is hoping to double that number by the end of the year.The main challenge, Coyote said, will be making enough machines to meet what it hopes will be huge demand."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/global-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-one-million/,Global coronavirus death toll passes one million,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — The global death toll from the new coronavirus, which emerged less than a year ago in China and has swept across the world, passed one million on Sunday.The pandemic has ravaged the global economy, inflamed geopolitical tensions and upended lives, from Indian slums and Brazil’s jungles to America’s biggest city New York.World sports, live entertainment and international travel ground to a halt as fans, audiences and tourists were forced to stay at home, kept inside by strict measures imposed to curb the virus spread.Drastic controls that put half of humanity — more than four billion people — under some form of lockdown by April at first slowed its pace, but since restrictions were eased cases have soared again.On Sunday 2230 GMT the disease had claimed 1,000,009 victims from 33,018,877 recorded infections, according to an AFP tally using official sources.The United States has the highest death toll with more than 200,000 fatalities followed by Brazil, India, Mexico and Britain.For Italian truck driver Carlo Chiodi those grim figures include both his parents, who he says he lost within days of each other.“What I have a hard time accepting is that I saw my father walking out of the house, getting into the ambulance, and all I could say to him was ‘goodbye’,” said Chiodi, 50.“I regret not saying ‘I love you’ and I regret not hugging him. That still hurts me,” he told AFP.With scientists still racing to find a working vaccine, governments are again forced into an uneasy balancing act: Virus controls slow the spread of the disease, but they hurt already reeling economies and businesses.The IMF earlier this year warned that the economic upheaval could cause a “crisis like no other” as the world’s GDP collapsed.Europe, hit hard by the first wave, is now facing another surge in cases, with Paris, London and Madrid all forced to introduce controls to slow cases threatening to overload hospitals.Masks and social distancing in shops, cafes and public transport are now part of everyday life in many cities.Mid-September saw a record rise in cases in most regions and the World Health Organization has warned virus deaths could even double to two million without more global collective action.“One million is a terrible number and we need to reflect on that before we start considering a second million,” the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan told reporters on Friday.“Are we prepared collectively to do what it takes to avoid that number? The SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes the illness known as Covid-19 made its first known appearance in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, ground zero of the outbreak.How it got there is still unclear but scientists think it originated in bats and could have been transmitted to people via another mammal.Wuhan was shut down in January as other countries looked on in disbelief at China’s draconian controls, even as they went about their business as usual.By March 11, the virus had emerged in over 100 countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic, expressing concern about the “alarming levels of inaction.”Patrick Vogt, a family doctor in Mulhouse, a city that became the outbreak’s epicentre in France in March, said he realised coronavirus was everywhere when doctors started falling ill, some dying.“We saw people in our surgery who had really big breathing problems, young and not-so-young who were exhausted,” he said. “We didn’t have any therapeutic solutions.” Nor did the virus spare the rich or famous this year.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent a week in hospital. Madonna tested positive after a tour of France as did Tom Hanks and his wife who recovered and returned home to Los Angeles after quarantine in Australia.The Tokyo Olympics, Rio’s famed Carnival and the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca are among the major events postponed or disrupted by the pandemic. Premier League football has restarted but with empty stadiums. The French Open tennis tournament is limiting its audiences to 1,000 a day.Israel has gone into full lockdown again and Moscow’s vulnerable have been ordered to stay home.As the restrictions tighten, protests and anger are rising as businesses worry about their survival and individuals grow frustrated about their jobs and families in the face of another round of lockdown measures.Anti-lockdown protesters and police clashed in central London on Saturday as officers dispersed the thousands at a demonstration.“This is the last straw — We were starting to get back on our feet,” said Patrick Labourrasse, a restaurant owner in Aix-en-Provence, a French city near Marseille which is again being forced to close down bars and restaurants.Along with the turmoil, though, lies some hope.The IMF says the economic outlook appears brighter now than it had been in June, even if it remains “very challenging”.Crucially, nine vaccine candidates are in last-stage clinical trials, with hopes some will be rolled out next year though questions remain about how and when they will be distributed around the world."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/avigan-maker-to-seek-virus-treatment-approval-after-trials/,Avigan maker to seek virus treatment approval after trials,1,"TOKYO, Japan (AFP) — The maker of anti-influenza drug Avigan said Wednesday it will apply for the medication to be approved for treating coronavirus patients after trials showed it can shorten recovery time.In a statement, manufacturer Fujifilm Toyama Chemical said its phase III trial in Japan, which began in March, was now complete.Of 156 individuals described as “analysis targets”, the median recovery time was 11.9 days in those receiving Avigan compared with 14.7 for patients given a placebo.Recovery was defined in the trial as when the virus was no longer detectable in PCR tests, and when symptoms related to temperature, oxygen saturation and chest imaging were improved.The “randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blind comparative study” did not produce any new safety concerns, Fujifilm said.The firm said it would now “conduct a detailed analysis of the data obtained in this trial, and will work to file Application for Partial Changes to include the additional indication in as early as October.”The drug, whose generic name is favipiravir, was approved for use in Japan in 2014, but only in flu outbreaks that are not effectively addressed by existing medications.It is not available on the market and can only be manufactured and distributed at the request of the Japanese government.Favipiravir, which can be taken orally as a pill, works by blocking the ability of a virus to replicate inside a cell.Avigan has been shown in animal studies to affect foetal development, meaning it is not given to pregnant women.Japan has heavily backed the drug, asking Fujifilm to ramp up production for use at home and offering to supply it for free to dozens of countries that have put in requests."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/half-of-covid-patients-suffer-ongoing-fatigue-study/,Half of Covid patients suffer ongoing fatigue: study,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — More than half of patients and staff who had Covid-19 at an Irish hospital suffered persistent fatigue in the aftermath of the initial disease, according to a new study Friday highlighting the “significant burden” of lingering symptoms.It comes as patient groups and doctors call for more research into the medium- and long-term effects of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which has sickened more than 29 million people across the world and killed at least 940,000.“Whilst the presenting features of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been well-characterized, the medium- and long-term consequences of infection remain unexplored,” said Liam Townsend, of St James’s Hospital and Trinity Translational Medicine Institute at Trinity College Dublin.The study, which tracked 128 participants at St James’s Hospital, found that 52 percent reported persistent fatigue when they were assessed an average of 10 weeks after “clinical recovery” from infection, regardless of how serious their initial infection was.The preliminary study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, included 71 people who had been admitted to hospital and 57 employees of the hospital who had mild illness. The average age was 50 and all participants had a confirmed positive Covid-19 test.Researchers looked at a variety of potential factors, including the severity of the initial illness and pre-existing conditions, including depression.They found that it made no difference whether a patient had been hospitalised or not.However, they did find that women, despite making up just over half of the participants (54 percent), accounted for two-thirds of those with persistent fatigue (67 percent).Those with a previous history of anxiety or depression were also found to be more likely to have fatigue.The authors said the findings showed that more work was needed to assess the impact of Covid-19 on patients in the longer term.“Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of post-viral fatigue in individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection after the acute phase of COVID-19 illness,” they concluded.The study, which is being presented at the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Conference on Coronavirus Disease (ECCVID) later this month, suggested those affected are “worthy of further study and early intervention”.As the pandemic has scorched its way across the planet, most attention has been focused on the immediate impact, measured by hospital admissions and deaths.But it has become increasingly clear that the virus can reverberate long after a patient has “recovered”.Online support groups across the world have attracted thousands of members looking for help and advice about ongoing illness.In July, a study of recovered hospital patients in Italy found that 87 percent were still suffering at least one symptom 60 days after falling ill. Fatigue and breathing difficulties were most common.Researchers from King’s College London, which is behind a large-scale symptoms-tracking project, estimate that one in 10 people using the app still have symptoms after 30 days and some remain unwell for months.“We are increasingly seeing evidence of ‘long Covid’, and fatigue is one of the commonly reported side effects. This study highlights that fatigue was experienced in both hospitalised patients and in those with milder initial presentations,” said Michael Head, of the University of Southampton, commenting on the latest research.“The emerging extent of long Covid is why it is important to reduce community transmission, even among younger groups of people who are not immediately seriously ill.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/rich-nations-have-cornered-half-of-future-covid-19-vaccine-supply-oxfam/,Rich nations have cornered half of future Covid-19 vaccine supply: Oxfam,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — A group of wealthy nations representing 13 percent of the global population have already bought up more than half of the promised doses of future Covid-19 vaccines, according to a report by Oxfam on Wednesday.The non-governmental organization analyzed deals struck by pharmaceuticals and vaccine producers for the five leading vaccine candidates currently in late-stage trials, based on data collected by the analytics company Airfinity.“Access to a life-saving vaccine shouldn’t depend on where you live or how much money you have,” said Robert Silverman of Oxfam America.“The development and approval of a safe and effective vaccine is crucial, but equally important is making sure the vaccines are available and affordable to everyone. Covid-19 anywhere is Covid-19 everywhere.”The five vaccines analyzed were from AstraZeneca, Gamaleya/Sputnik, Moderna, Pfizer and Sinovac.Oxfam calculated the combined production capacity of these five vaccine candidates at 5.9 billion doses, enough for three billion people given that all five future vaccines will or are highly likely to require two doses.Supply deals have so far been agreed for 5.3 billion doses, of which 2.7 billion (51 percent) have been bought by developed countries, territories and regions, including the US, UK, European Union, Australia, Hong Kong and Macau, Japan, Switzerland and Israel.The remaining 2.6 billion doses have been bought by or promised to developing countries including India, Bangladesh, China, Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico, among others.The non-profit added that one of the leading candidates, developed by Moderna, has received $2.5 billion in committed taxpayers’ money, but has said it intends to make a profit and has sold the options for all its supply to rich nations.Oxfam and other organizations are therefore calling for a “people’s vaccine” free of charge, distributed fairly based on need.“This will only be possible if pharmaceutical corporations allow vaccines to be produced as widely as possible by freely sharing their knowledge free of patents, instead of protecting their monopolies and selling to the highest bidder,” Oxfam said.It added that the estimated cost of providing a vaccine for everyone on Earth was less than one percent of the projected cost of Covid-19 to the global economy."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/vaccine-trial-by-aztrazeneca-oxford-university-resumes-as-virus-continues-grim-march/,Vaccine trial by AztraZeneca,1,"Clinical trials of one of the most advanced experimental Covid-19 vaccines resumed Saturday after a brief safety pause, as infection numbers continued to march upward in countries across the globe.The world’s hopes for a reprieve from the pandemic were dealt a blow earlier in the week when pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and Oxford University announced they had “voluntarily paused” their vaccine trial after a UK volunteer developed an unexplained illness.But on Saturday the trial was given the all clear by British regulators to resume following a safety review. The company also announced it was resuming clinical trials in Brazil next Monday after being given the green light there as well.The global death toll from the coronavirus has risen to 916,000 with 28.5 million infections, while France and the United Arab Emirates posted grim new milestones for daily infections on Saturday.And with billions still suffering from the fallout of the pandemic, a worldwide race for a vaccine is underway, with nine companies already in late-stage Phase 3 trials.Even during the pause, AstraZeneca said it remained hopeful that the vaccine could still be available “by the end of this year, early next year”.Oxford University said that “in large trials such as this, it is expected that some participants will become unwell and every case must be carefully evaluated”.Charlotte Summers, lecturer in intensive care medicine at Cambridge University, said the pause showed the researchers’ commitment “to putting safety at the heart of their development programme.”“To tackle the global Covid-19 pandemic, we need to develop vaccines and therapies that people feel comfortable using, therefore it is vital to maintaining public trust that we stick to the evidence and do not draw conclusions before information is available,” she said. That public trust will be crucial to convincing a public that is impatient for a vaccine — and in some corners skeptical.Among the impatient is US President Donald Trump, who has been accused by rival Joe Biden of “undermining public confidence” by regularly raising the possibility that a vaccine will be ready before November’s election.The Republican president is under pressure as the US toll continues to rise, nearing 6.5 million cases on Saturday with more than 193,000 deaths — by far the most in either measure in the world.Biden also called Trump “reckless” for holding a rally in the Nevada city of Reno even after the venue had to be changed because the event breached local Covid-19 restrictions. Television images of the rally Saturday showed a packed outdoors crowd, with few wearing face masks.Some of those potentially sceptical about a vaccine meanwhile turned out in numerous German cities and Poland’s capital Warsaw on Saturday, protesting against anti-coronavirus measures and often defying mask-wearing rules.The movement is made up of a number of different groups, from self-declared “free thinkers” to anti-vaccine campaigners, conspiracy theorists and far-right activists. There are signs of a resurgence of the virus in numerous countries that lifted many coronavirus measures after beating back the first wave of infections months ago.France reported 10,000 new infections on Saturday, the country’s highest daily number since launching wide-scale testing.The milestone came a day after Prime Minister Jean Castex declined to announce any new major restrictions despite a “clear worsening” in the country’s outbreak.“We have to succeed in living with this virus, without returning to the idea of a generalised lockdown,” Castex said.Another country to hit a daily milestone on Saturday was the United Arab Emirates, which recorded more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases for the first time.In Spain, which this week became the first EU country to pass half a million infections, a case was detected among Princess Leonor’s classmates.The 14-year-old heiress to the Spanish throne — who only returned to school in Madrid on Wednesday — will now have to observe a two-week quarantine.The uncle of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, businessman Mohamad Makhlouf, died from Covid-19 on Saturday, two close sources told AFP.And in Latin America, which this week passed the milestone of eight million virus cases, worst-hit Brazil charted more than 131,000 deaths from Covid-19 as of Saturday, the second-highest in the world behind the US.Latvia meanwhile reinstated a compulsory 14-day quarantine for arrivals from neighbouring Estonia due to an upsurge in cases there."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/vaccine-trust-growing-in-europe-falling-in-parts-of-asia-and-africa-survey/,Oxford University resumes as virus continues grim march,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Public trust in vaccine safety is slowly growing in Europe even as it dips in parts of Asia and Africa, researchers said Friday, calling for more investment in health information campaigns for the forthcoming Covid-19 vaccine.The largest ever global survey of vaccine confidence, published in the Lancet medical journal, shows clear links between political instability and misinformation and the levels of trust in the safety of medicines.The World Health Organization lists vaccine hesitancy as one of its top 10 global health threats, and dipping levels of immunisation coverage have seen outbreaks of preventable diseases such as polio and measles in recent years.The survey of nearly 300,000 respondents shows trust in vaccine safety increasing — with some exceptions — across Europe.In France, where confidence in vaccines has been consistently low for decades, it shows an increase from 22 percent to 30 percent of people strongly agreeing they are safe.In Britain, confidence in vaccine safety rose from 47 percent in May 2018 to 52 percent in November 2019.Poland and Serbia however saw significant declines in public vaccine confidence.Afghanistan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan saw “substantial” increases in the number of people strongly disagreeing that vaccines are safe between 2015 and 2019.In Azerbaijan, public mistrust surged from 2 percent to 17 percent in that timeframe.Authors of the research attributed this “worrying trend” in part to political instability and religious extremism.Heidi Larson from the London school of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who led the research, said online misinformation was also a significant problem.“When there is a large drop in vaccination coverage, it is often because there’s an unproven vaccine safety scare seeding doubt and distrust,” she said.Larson said that public mistrust in politicians in general also likely played a role.As the world races to find a vaccine to potentially end the Covid-19 pandemic, the researchers warned that governments need to ramp up investment in public information campaigns and as well as distribution infrastructure.Without this, Daniel Salmon from John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health said “there is a risk of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines never reaching their potential due to a continued inability to quickly and effectively respond to public vaccine safety concerns, real or otherwise”."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/sudans-silent-death-from-flesh-eating-cuts/,Sudan’s ‘silent death’ from flesh-eating cuts,1,"KHARTOUM, Sudan (AFP) — It seemed little to worry about: Sudanese farmer Khadija Ahmad was planting onions when she stepped on a thorn that pierced her sandal and cut her foot.But the thorn brought with it a flesh-eating infection, a bacterial and fungal disease called mycetoma, which rips through the body causing severe deformities.For Ahmad, a 45-year-old from El-Fasher in western Sudan’s war-ravaged Darfur region, the first she knew something was wrong was when her foot swelled.“At first I didn’t have any pain, just a lump,” she said. “We thought it would pass.”Mycetoma, listed as a neglected tropical disease by the UN’s World Health Organization (WHO), is all too common in Sudan.“I waited nine years before coming,” Ahmad said, as a doctor examined her at the Mycetoma Research Center (MRC) in the capital Khartoum.“When I arrived, it was too late,” she said, holding up her prosthetic leg in her arms. “It had to be amputated.”She now has to take medication for life.Sudanese have another name for the disease; the “silent death”.While few cases are fatal, mycetoma destroys the lives of its victims.Many infected are young farmers walking barefoot in the fields, the WHO says.For workers depending on manual labour to survive, the crippling infections act as a life sentence.Mycetoma, caused by bacteria or fungus and entering the body usually through cuts, is a progressively destructive infectious disease of the body tissue, affecting skin, muscle and even bone.It is often characterised by swollen feet, but it can also cause grotesque barnacle-like growths and club-like hands.“The disease grows slowly and slyly inside the body over many years,” said Ahmad Hassan Fahal, founder of the MRC clinic.It can manifest itself anywhere on the body, not just where the entry cut was made.“The organism goes inside the skin, and then it grows,” Fahal said.“Disability is very common; almost 60 percent of people who catch the disease end up with deformed limbs.”It thrives in the humid heat of tropical climates.Sudan is particularly affected by mycetoma, but it is endemic in a geographical “belt” of some 40 countries ranging from neighbouring Ethiopia and Chad, to India, Mexico and Venezuela.“In Sudan, we also call it the ‘silent death’, because it creates different problems — disability, deformity and difficulties — and it can kill the patient,” Fahal said.“People lose their limbs and cannot work.”Since MRC was founded in 1991, it has treated 9,000 patients free of charge from all over Sudan.For a fifth of those arriving at the centre, the only option left is amputation.Yet those who reach the centre are “the lucky ones”, Fahal said.“Most of the people are in the villages in remote areas and cannot come here,” he said. “They are the poorest of the poor.”In MRC’s modern hospital, 30 specialist doctors treat 400 patients per week — including patients coming from other mycetoma-affected nations.But MRC’s focus is its cutting-edge laboratory, a unique global research centre dedicated to the disease.In a treatment room, 22-year-old Walid Nour al-Dayem lies with his left foot wrapped in bandages.“A year ago, I was cutting the wheat harvest when I stepped on a thorn,” said Dayem, who comes from the farming village of Managil, in central Gezira state.“At the time, I didn’t feel much, but afterwards it got worse.”The local hospital told him to seek help at MRC.“Now I am waiting for my fate to be decided,” he said morosely.Doctors took samples from Dayem’s leg to see if his case is a bacterial or fungal infection, or both.For mycetoma, either is possible, complicating MRC’s long search for drugs.Antibiotics help against bacterial infections, but not for fungal cases.“The difficulty in finding a cure for this disease is because it is made of two different things, bacteria and fungus,” Fahal said.“So far, nobody has been able to create a medicine for the two together.”But researchers are working with Japanese and Swiss scientists on a new drug.“Hopefully, next year or the year after, we will have a result,” he said with a wide smile.“If we succeed it would be a great first.”© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/russia-vaccine-passes-early-trial-test-participants-developed-antibodies-within-1st-3-weeks/,Russia vaccine ‘passes early trial test’; participants developed antibodies within 1st 3 weeks,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — Early tests of a Russian coronavirus vaccine showed encouraging results when details were published Friday, but experts said the trials were too small to prove safety and effectiveness.Russia announced last month that its vaccine, named “Sputnik V” after the Soviet-era satellite that was the first launched into space in 1957, had already received approval.This raised concerns among Western scientists over a lack of safety data, with some warning that moving too quickly on a vaccine could be dangerous.Russia denounced criticism as an attempt to undermine Moscow’s research and a Russian investor claimed vindication when Britain’s prestigious Lancet published research that showed patients in early tests developed antibodies with “no serious adverse events.”In the Lancet study, Russian researchers reported on two small trials, each involving 38 healthy adults aged between 18 and 60, who were given a two-part immunization.Each participant was given a dose of the first part of the vaccine and then given a booster with the second part 21 days later.They were monitored over 42 days and all developed antibodies within the first three weeks.The report said the data showed that the vaccine was “safe, well tolerated, and does not cause serious adverse events in healthy adult volunteers”.The trials were open label and not randomised, meaning there was no placebo and the participants knew they were receiving the vaccine and were not randomly assigned to different treatment groups.Researchers underlined that larger and longer trials — including a placebo comparison — would be needed to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of the vaccine for preventing Covid-19 infection.The report said the 76 participants of these trials would be monitored up to 180 days, adding that a more rigorous phase 3 clinical trial was planned with the involvement of 40,000 volunteers “from different age and risk groups”. Kirill Dmitriev, who heads a Russian investment fund behind the vaccine, told an online news conference in Moscow that the Lancet publication “is a powerful response to the skeptics who unreasonably criticized the Russian vaccine.”Independent experts were still cautious.Naor Bar-Zeev of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study, said the research was “encouraging but small”, adding that it did not give any data on effectiveness among older age groups, who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19.“Showing safety will be crucial with Covid-19 vaccines, not only for vaccine acceptance but also for trust in vaccination broadly,” he said in a commentary in the Lancet.“Since vaccines are given to healthy people and, during the Covid-19 pandemic, potentially to everyone after approval following phase 3 trials, safety is paramount.”The pandemic has seen an unprecedented mobilisation of funding and research to rush through a vaccine that can protect billions of people worldwide.This week the US urged states to get ready for a potential Covid-19 vaccine rollout two days before the presidential election in November, sparking concerns President Donald Trump’s administration is accelerating research to fit a political timetable. Russia has said that industrial production of its version is expected from September.President Vladimir Putin said in early August that the vaccine gave “sustainable immunity” and that one of his own daughters had been inoculated, even though Russia’s health ministry said clinical trials were not yet complete.The World Health Organization has urged Russia to follow established guidelines and go “through all the stages” necessary to develop a safe vaccine.Sputnik V was developed by the Gamaleya research institute for epidemiology and microbiology in Moscow in coordination with the Russian defence ministry.It uses a cold-causing adenovirus, which is then modified and combined with a part of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.The report’s lead author, Denis Logunov of Gamaleya, said the adenovirus vaccine enters people’s cells and delivers the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein genetic code, helping the immune system “recognise and attack” the virus.Dmitriev said vaccine production “will initially be aimed at a Russian market, but we hope to have the possibility to supply the vaccine to an international market,” signalling interest from around 40 countries.The WHO insisted it would never endorse a vaccine that has not proven safe and effective and also said it did not expect widespread immunisation against the novel coronavirus until mid-2021.The organization said a total of 176 potential vaccines were being developed worldwide, including 34 being tested on people. Among those eight are at stage three, the most advanced."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-tempers-quick-vaccine-hopes/,WHO tempers quick vaccine hopes,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization said Friday it did not expect widespread immunization against the novel coronavirus until mid-2021, tempering hopes just as research revealed encouraging early results from a Russian vaccine.The virus which has killed nearly 870,000 people worldwide continues to spread, with Italy’s flamboyant former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi now in hospital after becoming the latest high-profile figure to test positive for Covid-19.Across the world, governments are hoping to announce a vaccine as soon as possible against the virus, which has infected well over 26 million people, upended millions of lives and wreaked havoc on the global economy.The UN health agency welcomed the fact that a “considerable number” of vaccine candidates had entered final stage trials, which typically involve tens of thousands of people.But “in terms of realistic timelines, we are really not expecting to see widespread vaccination until the middle of next year,” WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said.And WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the agency would not endorse a vaccine if it is not effective and safe. Russia has already approved a vaccine, and research published in The Lancet medical journal on Friday said patients involved in early tests developed antibodies with “no serious adverse events”.But scientists cautioned the trials were too small — just 76 participants — to prove safety and effectiveness.Washington has also urged US states to get ready for a potential vaccine rollout by November 1, sparking concerns President Donald Trump’s administration is rushing to begin distributing a vaccine before the November 3 election.Under normal procedures, test administrators must wait for months or years to verify that vaccine candidates are safe and efficacious.But there has been massive pressure to roll out a vaccine quickly as the pandemic continues to take its toll. Celebrities and prominent public figures have not been spared, with Berlusconi the latest to contract the coronavirus since it was first discovered in China in December last year.The list also includes three Paris Saint-Germain footballers including Brazilian star Neymar.Also on the list are movie stars Tom Hanks and more recently Robert Pattinson, whom Hollywood trade publications said contracted the disease while filming the latest Batman movie in Britain.Berlusconi spent the night in a Milan hospital where he is being treated for a lung infection but where is condition is said to be “encouraging”.The 83-year-old billionaire tested positive earlier this week after returning from a holiday on Sardinia’s jet-set Emerald Coast. All over the world, businesses and individuals are counting the cost of the pandemic, as flare-ups continue to force governments into imposing lockdowns.Even in areas where restrictions have eased, those who can work from home prefer to keep doing so rather than return to the office.In London’s normally bustling centre, eateries once packed with customers are suffering.“People saw they can work from home… we can’t serve someone from home,” said Berat, the manager at a Turkish restaurant close to St Paul’s Cathedral that only has 15 percent of its usual custom.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is trying to encourage Britons to return to the office, but that is easier said than done.Oil giant BP, which is slashing 10,000 jobs after the pandemic crushed energy demand and prices, is actively encouraging non-frontline staff to work from home.At Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds banks, meanwhile, much of the staff is working remotely. It is not all bad news, though.Both the US and Canadian economies added jobs in August, in a tentative sign of recovery from the pandemic.And for businesses in specific sectors like personal protective equipment, Covid-19 has triggered such fierce demand that they are struggling to keep up.Malaysian rubber glove manufacturer Top Glove said it is seeing orders for 11-12 billion a month, compared with 4.5 billion prior to the pandemic.The downside? Customers must now wait nearly 600 days for their orders to be filled, compared with normal delivery of 30-40 days, said chief executive, Lim Wee Chai.In addition, with raw materials in short supply, production costs are also rising."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/what-is-the-best-way-to-share-out-a-future-covid-19-vaccine/,What is the best way to share out a future Covid-19 vaccine?,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — An international group of ethicists on Thursday criticized the World Health Organization’s goal of distributing coronavirus vaccines to treat 20 percent of each country’s population, proposing instead what they said was a more equitable system of distribution.In an article published in the journal Science, US professor Ezekiel Emanuel and more than a dozen experts from Britain, Canada, Australia, Norway and Singapore suggested giving priority to countries where outbreaks are the most serious.The first task is “minimizing the number of premature deaths,” Emanuel, chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, told AFP.The group likewise refutes the idea that allocations of the vaccine should be in line with the number of medical workers or elderly people in a country, something that would automatically favor developed countries.“Who has a lot of health care workers and who has a lot of elderly over 65? Rich countries,” said Emanuel, who was an architect of president Barack Obama’s health care reforms.The experts’ system, which they call a “Fair Priority Model,” starts by calculating the number of years of life that will be added in a given country by the delivery of a million vaccine doses, for example.Peru, where Covid-19 mortality rates are currently very high, and the United States, where the virus continues to kill a thousand people every day, would most likely be on the priority list.“But take New Zealand, giving them a million doses, you’re probably not going to save but one or two people literally. So they would be low on the priority list,” he said. The group rejects the argument that its policies would reward bad management such as that in the United States, which leads the world in the number of virus deaths and cases.“You shouldn’t penalize Americans because Donald Trump can’t seem to manage this pandemic,” said Emanuel.Against Covid-19 “you don’t say everyone gets the same,” he said.“The country with the worst situation, they have to be treated first,” he added, comparing the situation to an emergency room where a heart attack victim is treated before the patient with sore throat.After calculating the years of life that might be saved, the experts propose taking into consideration minimizing the economic and social impact of the virus, such as unemployment, poverty and school closures.In their plan, priority populations are not necessarily health workers, but those put at risk by their housing situation, jobs or age.“A lot of health care workers are no longer getting infected because they know how to use the masks and the gowns and the gloves,” he said. “And so they may not need to be top of the list in terms of priority. You have to look at the empirical data.”He added that immunizing the elderly “may not work if they may not respond well to a vaccine.”Will the academic debate on how to share out a future vaccine gain traction with world leaders?Wealthy countries have already pre-ordered billions of vaccine doses for themselves and the mechanism set up by the WHO for a more equitable distribution, known as Covax, has not yet raised the funds needed to provide for the 92 poor countries that have signed up."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/unilever-to-cut-carbon-footprint-in-cleaning-items/,Unilever to cut carbon footprint in cleaning items,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever on Wednesday unveiled a one-billion-euro plan to remove fossil fuels in the production of cleaning and laundry products which have experienced soaring demand from coronavirus-fearing consumers.The initiative, worth the equivalent of $1.2 billion, will replace all the carbon derived from fossil fuels used in the production of some of Unilever’s best-known products by 2030, it said in a statement.Unilever aims to transform the sustainability of its best-known brands, including washing detergent Persil, Cif household cleaner and Domestos bleach, under its “Clean Future” project.“Clean Future is our vision to radically overhaul our business. As an industry, we must break our dependence on fossil fuels, including as a raw material for our products,” Unilever home care boss Peter ter Kulve said in the statement.The company has been boosted this year as the coronavirus pandemic and global lockdowns spark major changes in consumer behaviour, with people spending far more time at home and being much more concerned about hygiene.“We’ve seen unprecedented demand for our cleaning products in recent months and we are incredibly proud to play our part, helping to keep people safe in the fight against Covid-19,” Kulve said.“But that should not be a reason for complacency. We cannot let ourselves become distracted from the environmental crises that our world — our home — is facing. Pollution. Destruction of natural habitats. The climate emergency.“This is the home we share and we have a responsibility to protect it,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/experts-probe-obesity-link-to-severe-virus-response/,Experts probe obesity link to severe virus response,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Inflammatory and immune responses linked to obesity could help explain the likelihood of a more severe outcome among patients with Covid-19, European experts said Wednesday.As the new coronavirus has spread, killing more than 800,000 people globally, it has become increasingly clear that co-morbidities put patients at greater risk.In a presentation at European and International Congress on Obesity, researchers said that inflamation caused by a buildup of fat tissue in people with obesity, which is linked to other illnesses such as type two diabetes and cardiovascular disease, could play a role in patients’ response to Covid-19.They also suggested that the body’s blood pressure regulating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which includes the enzyme that the new coronavirus latches onto, was also potentially linked to worse outcomes.The RAAS can become overactivated in people with obesity.“We suggest that the increased fat mass may contribute to increased RAAS activity and inflammation in obesity, thereby providing a critical link between obesity and the increased COVID-19 susceptibility and poorer disease outcomes,” said Gijs Goossens of Maastricht University Medical Centre.He said that this could also be partly responsible for severe disease among older people with Covid-19.“Since ageing is accompanied by changes in body composition, namely reduced muscle mass and increased fat mass, it is tempting to postulate that this may at least partly contribute to the poorer outcomes in older individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2,” he added.Several studies have drawn links between obesity and a higher risk of serious illness from the new coronavirus.In July, Britain launched a campaign against obesity, after a Public Health England report found that the condition increased the risk of death from coronavirus by 40 percent.Goossens and colleagues, who published a related paper in Obesity Facts, the official journal of the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO), said the inflamation suffered by people with obesity is a result of weight gain causing changes to their adipose tissue.This leaves them with an impaired immune response to infections and increased viral loads when infected by viruses, they said.The inflammation can also cause the release of molecules called cytokines that trigger a response from the body’s immune system.With Covid-19, some patients have suffered what is known as the “cytokine storm”, when the immune system overreacts. It can cause serious effects and even death.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/chinese-bus-offers-new-evidence-of-airborne-coronavirus-spread-study/,Chinese bus offers new evidence of airborne coronavirus spread: study,1,"WASHINGTON D.C., United States (AFP) — A person on a poorly ventilated Chinese bus infected nearly two dozen other passengers with coronavirus even though many weren’t sitting close by, according to research published on Tuesday that offers fresh evidence the disease can spread in the air.Health authorities had initially discounted the possibility that simply breathing could send infectious micro-droplets into the air, but did a U-turn as experts piled on pressure and evidence mounted.The article published Tuesday in JAMA Internal Medicine probes the threat of airborne infection by taking a close look at passengers who made a 50-minute trip to a Buddhist event in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo aboard two buses in January before face masks became routine against the virus.Researchers believe a passenger, whose gender was not identified, was likely patient zero because the person had been in contact with people from Wuhan, the city where the contagion emerged late last year.The scientists managed to map out where the other passengers sat, and also test them for the virus, with 23 of 68 passengers subsequently confirmed as infected on the same bus.What is notable is that the sickness infected people in the front and back of the bus, outside the perimeter of 1-2 meters (three-six feet) that authorities and experts say infectious droplets can travel.On top of that, the sick passenger was not yet showing symptoms of the disease, such as a cough, when the group made their trip to a religious event.Researchers also noted the air conditioning simply recirculated the air inside the bus, which likely contributed to spreading of the virus.“The investigations suggest that, in closed environments with air recirculation, SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible pathogen,” they wrote, referring to the name of the virus.“Our finding of potential airborne transmission has important public health significance.”Their study, which includes a diagram showing where each infected passenger sat, adds to the evidence of airborne transmission, including research into how the virus spread between diners’ tables at a restaurant in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-urges-dialogue-with-virus-protesters/,WHO urges ‘dialogue’ with virus protesters,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization urged governments Monday to engage with people demonstrating against Covid-19 restrictions and listen to their concerns, but stressed protesters needed to understand the virus was dangerous.Asked about recent demonstrations in a number of countries against coronavirus restrictions, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was important to “listen to what people are asking, what people are saying”.“We should engage in an honest dialogue,” he told reporters, stressing though that demonstrators have a responsibility to ensure protests are safe.“The virus is real. It is dangerous. It moves fast and it kills,” he said, insisting “we have to do everything to protect ourselves and to protect others”.German police on Saturday halted a Berlin march by tens of thousands of people opposed to coronavirus restrictions in the biggest of several European protests against facemask rules and other anti-virus curbs.Several hundred of the Berlin protesters then broke through barriers and a police cordon to storm Germany’s parliament, in a move German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned as “shameful”.Speaking about the broader protests, WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan pointed out that “epidemics and emergencies create strong emotions, and acceptance of measures is always very, very tough.“It is really important that governments don’t overreact to people protesting against measures,” he told the virtual briefing.“The real important thing to do is to enter into a dialogue with groups.” While acknowledging the importance of allowing different viewpoints to be heard, Tedros took issue with the opinions voiced by some that high death rates were not really a concern if it is mainly the elderly who are dying.“Accepting someone to die because of age is moral bankruptcy at its highest, and we shouldn’t allow our society to behave this way,” he said.“Every life whether it is young or old is precious. And we have to do everything to save it.”Tedros voiced understanding for the growing frustration felt as people continue to have to deal with restrictions eight months into the pandemic.“We understand that people are tired and yearn to get on with their lives. We understand that countries want to get their societies and economies going again,” he said.The UN health agency, he stressed, “fully supports efforts to re-open economies and societies… but we want to see it done safely.”He also insisted that “no country can just pretend the pandemic is over”.“If countries are serious about opening up, they must be serious about suppressing transmission and saving lives,” he said, insisting that “opening up without having control is a recipe for disaster”.One major thing countries could do to control the virus is prevent so-called “amplifying events” like filling stadiums with sports fans, large religious gatherings or packed nightclubs.“Avoid these amplifying events so that the other economic sectors can actually open up and the economy can go back into life,” Tedros said.“I think we can live without going to the stadium.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/junk-food-linked-to-age-marker-in-chromosomes-study/,Junk food linked to age-marker in chromosomes: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — People who eat a lot of industrially processed junk food are more likely to exhibit a change in their chromosomes linked to ageing, according to research presented Tuesday at an online medical conference.Three or more servings of so-called “ultra-processed food” per day doubled the odds that strands of DNA and proteins called telomeres, found on the end of chromosomes, would be shorter compared to people who rarely consumed such foods, scientists reported at the European and International Conference on Obesity.Short telomeres are a marker of biological ageing at the cellular level, and the study suggests that diet is a factor in driving the cells to age faster.While the correlation is strong, however, the causal relationship between eating highly processed foods and diminished telomeres remains speculative, the authors cautioned.Each human cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes that contain our genetic code.Telomeres do not carry genetic information, but are vital for preserving the stability and integrity of chromosomes and, by extension, the DNA that all the cells in our body relies on to function.As we get older, our telomeres shorten naturally because each time a cell divides, part of the telomere is lost.That reduction in length has long been recognised as a marker of biological age.Scientists led by professors Maria Bes-Rastrollo and Amelia Marti, both of the University of Navarra in Spain, wanted to explore a suspected connection between the regular consumption of highly processed junk food and shrinking telomeres.Earlier studies had pointed to a possible link with sugar-sweetened drinks, processed meats and other foods loaded with saturated fats and sugar, but the findings were inconclusive.Ultra-processed foods are industrially manufactured substances composed of some mix of oils, fats, sugars, starch and proteins that contain little if any whole or natural foods.They often include artificial flavourings, colourings, emulsifiers, preservatives and other additives that increase shelf-life and profit margins.These same properties, however, also mean that such foods are nutritionally poor compared to less processed alternatives, the researchers said.Earlier studies have shown strong correlations between ultra-processed foods and hypertension, obesity, depression, type 2 diabetes and some forms of cancer.These conditions are often age-related in so far as they are linked to oxidative stress and inflammation known to influence telomere length.Marti and colleagues looked at health data for nearly 900 people aged 55 or older who provided DNA samples in 2008 and provided detailed data about their eating habits every two years thereafter.The 645 men and 241 women were equally divided into four groups, depending on their consumption of ultra-processed foods.Those in the high-intake group were more likely to have a family history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and abnormal blood fats.That also consumed less foods associated with the Mediterranean diet — fibre, olive oil, fruits, vegetable and nuts.Compared to the group who ate the fewest ultra-processed foods, the other three showed an increased likelihood — 29, 40 and 82 percent, respectively — of having shortened telomeres.The findings were published earlier this year in the peer-reviewed American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.© Agence France-Presse"

He has filed a case against the environment ministry.Up to 75,000 protesters thronged the square in front of the cathedral in downtown Port-Louis, an AFP reporter said, in the biggest demonstration in 40 years.Many of them were dressed in black — the colour of mourning. Public anger has boiled over in Mauritius after at least 34 melon-headed whales were found dead or seriously ill near the site of the spill.Fisheries minister Sudheer Maudhoo had said there was “no trace of hydrocarbons on them or in their respiratory system”.“This rally is an occasion to send a message to tell Pravind Jugnauth he has messed up,” marcher Jocelyne Leung, 35, told AFP.“This is the first time that a citizens’ demonstration has gathered such a big crowd,” said Ajay Gunness, the number two of the opposition MMM party.Many protesters carried the national flag, sang the national anthem, and called for Jugnauth to step down.Authorities and experts from Japan and Britain are still investigating the true extent of the ecological damage to an island whose economy depends heavily on tourism.This archipelago is a tourist haven and many of it’s 1.3 population derive their livelihood from tourism or fishing.Veteran politician Jugnauth, whose current stint in power began in 2017, has denied making any mistakes in handling the spill.© Agence France-Presse"

What’s your name?” the 1.4-meter-tall (4.6 feet) robot asks patients as it goes from room to room.It moves around on wheels and has a camera and display screen enabling relatives and doctors to chat with patients or staff in full protective gear in the coronavirus ward.“It allows us to have a physical presence… but with zero exposure to aerosols within the Covid-19 area,” said Lucia Ledesma, a neuropsychologist at the November 20 National Medical Center.The hospital robot, part of a global trend aimed at reducing the risk of infection during the pandemic, was even designated as a “co-therapist” for coronavirus patients in July.Since then, it has carried out around 160 missions with infected patients, their relatives and the mental health team.It can even make soothing sounds to reduce the stress caused by isolation.The robot “helps us with the mental health of the patient,” said Sandra Munoz, who coordinates the hospital’s strategy against the virus, which has killed more than 60,000 people in Mexico.The bot has computer vision enabling it to recognize people and sensors to help it to move around.It is a lifeline for patients like Rosa Maria Velazquez, one of more than half a million Mexicans who have been infected with the virus.“As (families) cannot enter, they see us and we see them, and that cheers us all up,” the 55-year-old said from her hospital bed.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-floats-idea-of-early-approval-for-eventual-covid-19-vaccine/,US floats idea of early approval for eventual COVID-19 vaccine,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The head of the US Food and Drug Administration raised the possibility in an interview published Sunday that a future vaccine against the coronavirus might be given emergency approval before the end of trials designed to ensure its safety and effectiveness.A request for such extraordinary approval would have to come from the vaccine developer, Stephen Hahn told the Financial Times.“If they do that before the end of Phase Three,” which involves large-scale human testing, “we may find that appropriate. We may find that inappropriate, we will make a determination.”But Hahn insisted he was not acting under pressure from President Donald Trump, who has been pushing hard for a vaccine, saying one might be ready before US elections November 3.“This is going to be a science, medicine, data decision,” Hahn said. “This is not going to be a political decision.”Three Western drugs makers are well along with their Phase 3 clinical trials, involving tens of thousands of participants.The three are AstraZeneca, which is partnering with Oxford University in England; Moderna, collaborating with the US National Institutes of Health, and the Pfizer/BioNTech alliance.By the nature of the trials it is difficult to predict when reliable results will emerge.Half of the participants in such trials receive an experimental vaccine, while the other half are given a placebo.Under normal procedures, test administrators must wait — probably for months — to see whether there is a statistically significant difference in the infection rate of the two groups.As the world desperately awaits an effective vaccine against the deadly virus, China and Russia have already approved vaccines without waiting for the conclusion of trials — drawing criticism from public health officials in other countries, including the US.Hahn also said that an emergency authorization would not necessarily cover everyone — it might be granted for specific, high-risk groups.“Our emergency use authorization is not the same as a full approval,” he said.Hahn has faced mounting criticism from the medical community that he has given in to political pressure from the Trump administration, largely involving two incidents.In March, the FDA gave emergency authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 after Trump repeatedly praised its use; the authorization had to be withdrawn in June after serious side effects emerged.More recently, Hahn delivered a far too optimistic appraisal, during a news conference with Trump, of the effectiveness of convalescent plasma against the virus. He said it could save 35 out of 100 patients; the more likely number, experts said, is five in 100.“It is f-ing outrageous to expedite *any* approval of a #SARSCoV2 vaccine, irrespective of @SteveFDA’s subservience to Trump,” Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said on Twitter.“We will not know about safety for many months.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/women-may-mount-stronger-covid-19-immune-response/,Women may mount stronger Covid-19 immune response,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — A new study looking at male and female immune responses to the new coronavirus may shed new light on why men are more likely to become seriously ill with Covid-19, researchers said Wednesday.Since early in the pandemic it has been clear that men, particularly older men, are at a far higher risk of dying from the virus than women of a similar age, but scientists have not yet been able to pinpoint exactly why.A new study published in the journal noted that globally men account for about 60 percent of deaths from Covid-19 and looked at whether differences in immune responses could explain why.“What we found was that men and women indeed develop different types of immune responses to Covid-19,” said the study’s lead author Akiko Iwasaki, a professor at Yale University, in a video.The immunity specialist said “these differences may underlie heightened disease susceptibility in men”.Researchers collected nasal, saliva, and blood samples from non-infected control subjects and patients with the disease who were treated at Yale New Haven Hospital in the United States.They then monitored patients to look at their immune responses.Researchers found that women mounted a more robust immune response involving T lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell that can recognize viruses and eliminate them.This was the case even among older women, the study found.In contrast, older men had weaker T cell activity — the older they were, the weaker the response.Overall men also produced more cytokines, which are inflammatory proteins that form another part of the body’s natural immune defence.However, severe cases of Covid-19 have been linked to what is known as a “cytokine storm”, when the immune system goes into overdrive, which is harmful and potentially deadly.Men who showed high concentrations early on were more likely to have a severe case of the disease, while those women who also showed significant cytokine levels also appeared to fare worse, the study found.According to the authors, this could imply that men and women need different treatments.For men, for example “we should be enhancing their T cell responses with vaccines” Iwasaki said, while women could be given treatment to dampen the cytokine response.But the study has limitations.Firstly, the sample size was relatively small, with 98 patients in total.The average age of the patients was also high, at around sixty years.Commenting on the research, Eleanor Riley, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, said some of the divergence noted in the study is “likely due to differences in age or BMI (the sex differences disappear once these other factors are taken into account)”. BMI measures body fat.She said others could have arisen “by chance”.“Importantly, although the average response may differ between men and women, the range of most of the measurements in men and women overlap significantly, meaning that many women have responses that are indistinguishable from those of many men,” she added.Riley said this is why treatments would be better if they were individually tailored, rather than defined solely on sex.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/as-neighbours-build-dams-iraqis-watch-twin-rivers-dry-up/,As neighbours build dams,1,"DIWANIYAH, Iraq (AFP) — With its neighbours activating new dams, Iraq’s historic twin rivers could run dry — unless new infrastructure projects and tense talks with Turkey and Iran bear fruit.Nowhere is the effect on the country more palpable than in Basra, Iraq’s only coastal province.Here, the Tigris and Euphrates — on which millions of Iraqis rely to farm — meet at the Shatt al-Arab waterway before spilling into the Gulf.But with flows already heavily weakened, seawater is pushing back into the freshwater rivers, strangling wildlife and human settlements that have survived on these banks for millennia.“Salinity has gone up in recent years and it’s killing the farmlands,” said Abu Shaker, a 70-year-old who has spent decades growing Iraq’s famed date palms.Now, with such little fresh water, Abu Shaker and fellow farmers have left their ancient palms withering on cracked and salty earth, moving north in search of potable water.“Before, we could sell our dates in the Gulf and as far as the United States,” he said.“Now, you can see with your own eyes. This whole river died.”Iraq’s water woes aren’t new. But with increasing regional desertification and population growth, Turkey and Iran are keener than ever to keep precious water resources for themselves.Their new dams on the Tigris and Euphrates, and the tributaries that feed them, have reduced water flows into Iraq by half, said Baghdad’s Water Minister Mehdi al-Hamdani.But he remains hopeful, with plans in the works to improve access across the country and guarantee drinking water to all, even in a worst-case scenario.Hamdani, who headed Iraq’s dams directorate before becoming minister, said there were plans to build a large reservoir in Makhoul, north of Baghdad.“It would allow us to store more water, generate electricity and protect Baghdad in case of floods,” he said.It would be one of the biggest infrastructure projects in Iraq since 2003, when a US-led force toppled dictator Saddam Hussein and unleashed years of conflict.Since then, government plans to rehabilitate dilapidated power grids, water networks and roads have been regularly derailed by warfare, most recently the years-long fight against the Islamic State group, which Iraq declared defeated in late 2017.A health crisis sparked by a shortage of safe drinking water hospitalised some 100,000 people in Basra in 2018.This year, an unprecedented fiscal crunch caused by low oil prices forced the government to suspend infrastructure investments.But new dams alone won’t save Iraq’s waterways, experts warn.Sustainable access, they say, will only be secured through water-sharing deals with Ankara and Tehran.Talks with Turkey, which have focused on the enormous Ilisu dam on the Tigris, were suspended for two years but resumed in May, when Iraq’s new cabinet came into power.Hamdani vowed that an ongoing air and ground assault by Ankara on Kurdish militants in northern Iraq would not derail the “positive” talks, which included a deal to regulate filling the Ilisu.Iran to the east has also activated dams, causing flows to the Dukan and Darbandikhan reservoirs in Iraqi Kurdistan to drop “from 45 cubic meters per second to seven cubic meters per second,” according to the ministry.In some parts, flows are at a meagre “two cubic metres per second — that is to say, an almost total interruption.”Hamdani was again optimistic, however, saying comprehensive negotiations with Tehran were proceeding smoothly.But as a receiving country, Iraq has little leverage, lamented Mohammed al-Chaleyhawi, who leads a farming cooperative in the southern agricultural heartland of Diwaniyah.“Turkey can launch a water war at any moment, whenever it suits it,” Chaleyhawi told AFP.The droughts that wrecked Iraq’s harvests between 2016 and 2018 were a taste of what may come, he said, warning that within five years, the Tigris and Euphrates could dry up, killing wildlife and limiting potable water.“Iraq only has one solution: using economic pressure against Turkey,” said Chaleyhawi, suggesting Baghdad could restrict the import of Turkish goods and services.Others have suggested trading crude for water, like under the 1990s United Nations-led programme that allowed an Iraq under crippling sanctions to trade barrels for food and medicine.But Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer, needs to act fast.Already the world is using less crude, and Iraq’s nearly 40 million people need 71 billion cubic metres of water yearly, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization.By 2035, when Turkey and Iran’s dams are set to be completed, Iraq is set to receive just 51 billion cubic metres.And the population of the “land between the two rivers” will have swelled to more than 50 million, for whom the life-giving waters could be just a distant memory.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/climate-change-clearly-fuelled-australia-bushfires-inquest/,Iraqis watch twin rivers dry up,1,"SYDNEY, Australia (AFP) — Australia’s devastating 2019-2020 bushfires were “clearly” fuelled by climate change, a government inquiry reported Tuesday following some of the largest forest fires ever recorded worldwide.With this year’s fire season already underway, authorities recommended urgent action to limit the impact of extreme blazes, expected “to become more frequent” in future.The deadly bushfires raged for nine months to March and were most severe in New South Wales state, where 11,000 fires burned over 5.5 million hectares (13 million acres) — the size of many countries.After months of consultation and expert testimony, the New South Wales government on Tuesday published a 436-page report on the crisis that destroyed more than 2,400 homes in the state and left 26 people dead.The text included dozens of recommendations and featured a blunt rebuke of those who insisted the fires were nothing to do with climate change.“Climate change as a result of increased greenhouse gas emissions clearly played a role in the conditions that lead up to the fires and in the unrelenting conditions that supported the fires to spread,” it read.The report noted it was impossible to say what precise role climate change had played in producing the complex range of climatic conditions that helped fuel the fires.Those conditions included a years-long drought, high winds, thunderstorms and low humidity.While cautioning that “climate change does not explain everything that happened”, the authors noted that the catastrophic conditions were “consistent with what climate change projections have been saying will happen”.“Extreme fires and fire seasons are likely to become more frequent,” they warned.The report also rubbished suggestions by those opposing action on climate change — including some inside Australia’s conservative government — that arson and insufficient forest clearance were to blame.Only 11 of the blazes in New South Wales were found to have been the work of an arsonist deliberately trying to start a bushfire.Many of the largest fires were caused by lightning strikes in remote areas, the document said.The report’s recommendations largely focused on disaster response and mitigation, including the use of technology to detect remote fires more quickly, and increased aerial water-bombing to stop them growing beyond control.“We couldn’t get to all the new fires quickly enough, many of which were started by lightning in remote or rugged terrain,” the report said.“The scale of the fires stretched the capacity of the fire authorities and the underpinning systems to respond.”But there was also a warning that Australians may have to come to terms with “new extreme” conditions.Bushfire-prone Australia has seen dozens of inquests into the causes of bushfires and steps that could be taken to mitigate them.But many measures recommended by inquiries going back to the 1930s have still not been implemented.A national-level Royal Commission is expected to produce its findings about the crisis by the end of the month.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/hong-kong-first-proven-case-of-covid-reinfection/,Climate change ‘clearly’ fuelled Australia bushfires: inquest,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Researchers in Hong Kong Monday identified what they said was the first confirmed case worldwide of COVID-19 reinfection, raising questions about the durability of immunity, whether acquired naturally or with a vaccine.“Our study proves that immunity for COVID infection is not lifelong — in fact, reinfection can occur quite quickly,” said Kelvin Kai-Wang To, a microbiologist at Hong Kong University’s Faculty of Medicine and lead author of a forthcoming study that details the findings.“COVID-19 patients should not assume after they recover that they won’t get infected again,” he told AFP in an interview.Even people who have shaken off the virus should practice social distancing, wear masks and practise hand washing, he advised.They should also get tested if suspect symptoms appear.The case came to light when a 33-year old resident of Hong Kong passed through mandatory screening earlier this month at the Hong Kong airport on his way back from Europe. The so-called PCR swab test was positive.This came as a surprise because the man had contracted — and recovered from — a COVID infection four-and-a-half months earlier, and was assumed to have immunity, especially after such a brief time since the infection.To find out whether he had suffered a relapse or had been infected anew, To and his team sequenced the two virus strains and compared their genomes, or genetic coding.The two viral signatures were “completely different”, and belonged to different coronavirus lineages, or clades.The first closely resembled strains collected in March and April, and the second strain matched the virus found in Europe — where the patient had just been visiting — in July and August.“The virus mutates all the time,” said To. “It is very unlikely that the patient would have gotten the second virus during the first infection.”The fact that a blood sample — taken shortly after the positive test at the airport — showed no antibodies is a further indication that the second virus had not been lingering unnoticed for months.“This is certainly stronger evidence of reinfection than some of the previous reports because it uses the genome sequence of the virus to separate the two infections,” said Jeffrey Barret, a senior scientific consultant for the COVID-19 Genome Project at the Welcome Sanger Institute, commenting on the study.Up to now, there have been many cases of suspected re-infection, but none were able to rule out the possibility that the virus has remained latent and reemerged after weeks or months.But experts differed as to how alarmed the world should be by the new findings, which will be published in the peer-reviewed medical journal .“This is a worrying finding for two reasons,” said David Strain, a clinical senior lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School.“It suggests that previous infections are not protective. It also raises the possibility that vaccinations may not provide the hope that we have been waiting for.”If antibodies don’t provide lasting protection, “we will need to revert to a strategy of viral near-elimination in order to return to a normal life”, he added.In the same vein, To said that scientists developing vaccines should look not just at the immune response, but at the duration of protection from infection.But other researchers suggested that the case uncovered was far more likely to be extremely rare.“It is to be expected that the virus will naturally mutate over time,” said microbiologist Brendan Wren of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.“This is a very rare example of re-infection and it should not negate the global drive to develop COVID-19 vaccines.”Barrett agreed.“This may be very rare, and it may be that second infections — when they do occur — are not serious,” he said.Indeed, the reinfection of the Hong Kong patient was complete asymptomatic.But this could also mean that such an outcome may be more common than suspected, said To.“People don’t get tested all the time after they recover, especially if they have no symptoms,” he said by phone.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/stricken-ship-behind-oil-spill-sunk-off-mauritius/,Fire crews make progress battling historic California blazes,1,", (AFP) — The broken stem of a Japanese-owned ship which ran aground causing a devastating oil spill in pristine waters off Mauritius, has been successfully sunk in the open ocean, the national crisis committee said Monday.The MV Wakashio ran aground on a coral reef off the Indian Ocean island on July 25 and began leaking oil two weeks later, prompting a race against the clock to pump all the fuel off the bulk carrier before it broke in two.The operation was successful and two tugboats last week began towing the larger, forward section of the vessel some 15 kilometres (nine miles) out into the open ocean, where it has been sunk to a depth of 3,180 metres.The smaller section remains wedged on the reef where the shipwreck occurred.“The planned sinking of the stem (forward) section of the casualty has been completed and at around 3.30pm was no longer visible on the sea surface,” read a statement from the crisis committee.Greenpeace opposed the plan, warning last week that sinking the vessel would “risk biodiversity and contaminate the ocean with large quantities of heavy metal toxins”.Over 1,000 tonnes of oil spilled into the pristine waters that have long been a major draw for honeymooners, and contain precious mangroves and coral reefs.Last week a team of British scientists arrived to co-ordinate an impact assessment on what damage has been done to the island and how to help the eco-system recover.International experts from Japan and France are also on the ground assisting the archipelago nation in the wake of the spill.Senior British marine monitoring scientist Dr Sue Ware told AFP the team would help “determine the footprint of the oil both on the shoreline and… whether it has managed to reach any areas of the seabed” and how it has impacted mangroves, coral reefs and different marine species.She said efforts by Mauritius to place booms in the water appeared to have been successful in preventing oil from reaching the protected Blue Bay wetlands area.The captain of the ship and his second-in-command were arrested on Tuesday.Officials have yet to reveal why the ship, which was making its way from Singapore to Brazil, came so close to the island.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/convalescent-plasma-what-you-need-to-know/,Stricken ship behind oil spill sunk off Mauritius,1,"The United States has issued an emergency authorization to use blood plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients as a treatment against the disease.Is it safe and effective? Has US President Donald Trump’s administration put political considerations ahead of the science? Here’s what you need to know. When a person has COVID-19, their body produces antibodies that fight the coronavirus. These proteins float in plasma, the liquid component of blood.The antibodies can be harvested from patients who have recovered and injected into the blood of others to help them fight the same infection.The idea isn’t new — so-called “passive immunization” — was first tried out against diphtheria in 1892 and later against the 1918 flu pandemic. – The research into these questions is ongoing, but some early signs have been encouraging.In June, the Mayo Clinic analyzed the safety of plasma following transfusion in a group of 20,000 COVID-19 patients, finding extremely low rates of side-effects such as heart failure, lung injury, allergic reaction and death.“We concluded that the use of convalescent plasma was safe,” Dr Scott Wright, who led the study that was published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, told AFP.Importantly, there was no sign of an effect called “antibody-dependent enhancement,” when antibodies that aren’t well suited to stopping a virus actually lead to more cells becoming infected.On the question of how well it works, all experts agree on the need for more clinical trials to compare plasma against standard care.Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist of the World Health Organization, said a few smaller trials have reported their findings but “the results, in some cases, point to some benefit, but have not been conclusive.”Another study by Mayo Clinic — which was not a clinical trial and hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed — suggested plasma helped reduce death rates among hospitalized patients when given early and when the antibody levels were high.But there was no placebo, making it hard to read too much into the findings.It enrolled 35,000 patients and showed that those who received transfusions within three days of their COVID-19 diagnosis had an 8.7 percent death rate in the next week.Those who received plasma after four or more days had an 11.9 percent death rate.Researchers at Johns Hopkins University are meanwhile running a trial in which they are using plasma to immunize patients before they have a chance to get sick.Dr David Sullivan, who is leading this trial, compared it to an “immediate vaccine.”If it works, “we can tell people that if you’re high risk… you can get this early, and you don’t have to worry about going to the hospital,” he told AFP.Some scientists believe that while plasma might be useful right now, in the long-run it might be more advantageous to identify the best antibodies to COVID-19 then synthesize them in labs.These are known as “monoclonal antibodies” and they are being developed by biotech firms including Regeneron and Lilly.The advantages are that doctors know precisely what they are getting and can dose accordingly, and the drugs can be mass-produced.On the other hand, since the virus is continually mutating, antibodies that were produced in a lab to fight an older version might not be as effective as recently-harvested plasma. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has previously issued emergency authorizations for antiviral remdesivir, after it was shown to have moderate efficacy against the coronavirus, and for the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which was subsequently reversed following safety concerns.Political commentators have questioned the timing of the FDA’s latest move as Trump lags in polls before the November election.Indeed, in making the announcement, both Trump and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn misrepresented a key statistic when they said that plasma reduced mortality rates by 35 percent.FDA spokeswoman Emily Miller later clarified on Twitter that the figure referred to the relative reduction in mortality risk for people who received high-levels of antibodies in the Mayo Clinic study compared to those who received low-levels.“It does undermine the credibility of the entire United States government and the administration but specifically these institutions,” said Dr Matthew Heinz, a physician in Arizona who served in former president Barack Obama’s health department.But Dr Daniel Hanley, who directs Johns Hopkins’ multisite clinical trials, said that early results had met the threshold for emergency approval.“One thing to emphasize is this information is coming in faster than it has in any other pandemic,” he told AFP."

We dream in drug development of something like a 35 percent mortality reduction. This is a major advance in the treatment of patients. This is a major advance.”Such a reduction would indeed be a game changer in the fight against the pandemic — but the statistic is false.The officials said these results came from a study of 35,000 patients conducted by Mayo Clinic, but Dr Scott Wright, the study’s leader, told AFP it did not come from his institution’s research. He said he believed it might be an “integrated analysis” the FDA had arrived at by looking at both Mayo’s work and other studies.FDA spokeswoman Emily Miller later tweeted that 35 percent referred to the relative difference in mortality risk between those patients in Mayo’s study who received a high level of antibodies against those who received a low level of antibodies.“I have been criticized for remarks I made Sunday night about the benefits of convalescent plasma,” said Hahn in a tweet thread on Monday night. “The criticism is entirely justified. What I should have said better is that the data show a relative risk reduction not an absolute risk reduction.”But it was not immediately clear which figures the FDA had used from the Mayo study to arrive even at this far more modest claim. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed and is available in “preprint” form on a medical research server, so it remains possible that more data will eventually be forthcoming.The scientific community is divided on whether plasma should have received an emergency use approval.Early research suggests it may be helpful and safe but no clinical trials — considered the gold standard of medical research — have yet found conclusively in its favor.Political commentators have questioned the timing of the FDA’s latest move as Trump lags in polls before the November election."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/california-fires-cover-1-million-acres-amid-fears-of-new-spread/,California fires cover 1 million acres amid fears of new spread,1,"LOS ANGELES, California (AFP) — Firefighters on Sunday battled some of California’s largest-ever fires that have forced tens of thousands from their homes and burned one million acres, with further lightning strikes and gusty winds forecast in the days ahead.Thousands of lightning strikes have hit the state in the past week, igniting fires that left smoke blanketing the region, bringing the total area burned to “close to one million acres,” or 400,000 hectares, according to CalFire public information officer Jeremy Rahn.That is considered a stunning toll this early in California’s fire season, which normally runs from August to November, and it comes as exhausted firefighters are already struggling to keep up with the far-flung blazes.The National Weather Service said dry thunderstorms could spark additional wildfires, adding that “the western US and Great Plains are shrouded under a vast area of smoke.” It issued red-flag warnings covering large swaths of northern and central California.These conditions “could cause erratic winds, extreme fire behavior within the existing fires, and have a potential for new fires to start,” the CalFire website said.Firefighters are stretched so thin that the state has turned down some local officials’ requests for help with equipment or personnel, forcing them to rely on volunteers and local agencies, the Los Angeles Times said.About 2,600 firefighters are now tackling the two largest blazes, out of roughly 14,000 battling “nearly two dozen major fires,” according to Rahn.With California pleading for outside help, several western states, the federal government and even the governments of Canada and Australia have responded.“Many of these firefighters have been on the lines for 72 hours, and everybody is running on fumes,” Assemblyman Jim Wood of the Healdsburg district in Sonoma told the Los Angeles Times. “Our first responders are working to the ragged edge of everything they have.”The disparate force battling the many blazes now includes 2,400 fire engines, 60 of them from other states, with several hundred more requested, CalFire said.More than 200 aircraft, including 95 fixed-wing planes, are taking part in what CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant called “a significant air force” dropping loads of water, monitoring the spread of flames or ferrying firefighters and equipment.Some 200 National Guardsmen have also been mobilized to help, he added.Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday posted a dramatic photograph of clouds of smoke rising from fires. “This is from today,” he said, “and is just a small part of the nearly 600 fires we are battling this week.”He said Saturday that the White House had granted a request for a presidential disaster declaration to aid in the state’s response.He tweeted apocalyptic images of smoldering orange roadsides thick with smoke, with sparks flying as trees burned ferociously.Wineries in the famed Napa and Sonoma regions, which are still reeling from blazes in recent years, are under threat.The two largest blazes — the SCU Lightning Complex to the south of the San Francisco Bay area, and the LNU Lightning Complex to the north — have burned about 680,000 acres and destroyed more than 850 structures.They are the second and third largest fires in California history, with the SCU fire only 10 percent contained and the LNU fire 17 percent contained.Five deaths have been linked to the latest flare-ups, with four bodies recovered on Thursday, including three from a burned house in a rural area of Napa County.But many residents have refused evacuation orders.“At least if we’re here, we know exactly what’s going on,” Napa resident John Newman, 68, told the San Francisco Chronicle as he sat in a lawn chair in his driveway. “Family is worried, but it’s a little different if you’re here firsthand.”Nature reserves were also ravaged. The Big Basin Redwoods State Park said that some of its historic buildings had been destroyed by flames.The park, where giant redwood trees of well over 500 years old can be found, was “extensively damaged,” it said.About 119,000 people have been evacuated, with many struggling to find shelter and hesitating to go to centers set up by authorities because of coronavirus risks.In some counties south of San Francisco, evacuees opted to sleep in trailers along the Pacific Ocean as they fled nearby fires, while tourists were urged to leave to free up accommodation.California has already been struggling, more than most with US states with the coronavirus. The combination of that disease and the thick smoke from wildfires has caused what the San Francisco Chronicle called “a respiratory nightmare.”A doleful headline in the paper asked, “What masks can protect you from both smoke and COVID-19?”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/600-million-settlement-in-flint-water-crisis/,$600 million settlement in Flint water crisis,1,"WASHINGTON D.C., United States (AFP) — The US state of Michigan has agreed to pay some $600 million to victims of the Flint water crisis, a health scandal that became a symbol of social injustice in America, officials said Thursday.The settlement could see payments to tens of thousands of people, children and adults alike, who may have ingested lead-tainted drinking water after the city of Flint changed the source for its water system in 2014 to cut costs.“What happened in Flint should have never happened, and financial compensation with this settlement is just one of the many ways we can continue to show our support for the city of Flint and its families,” Governor Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement.She called the suffering and delays in addressing the problem “unconscionable” and acknowledged the settlement “may not completely provide all that Flint needs.”Napoli Shkolnick PLLC, the law firm representing victims in their lawsuit, said the settlement included the state, Flint city, former state and city employees, and former governor Richard Snyder.“The Flint community and children have suffered significantly; this settlement is the beginning of the process for healing and supporting this important community,” said attorney Paul Napoli.At least 12 people died after the decaying industrial city switched its drinking water source to the polluted Flint River to cut costs in 2014.However, officials failed to add corrosion controls to the new tap water source, allowing lead and other contaminants to leach from the city’s aging pipe system.Authorities initially dismissed complaints from residents in the majority black city where many live below the poverty line.They were eventually pushed to act following national attention and Environmental Protection Agency pressure.Most of the money is earmarked for children in the city of Flint, who were at greatest risk of neurological and physical harm from lead-tainted tap water.More than 8,000 children are believed to have consumed lead-contaminated water, and a study found that the proportion of infants and children with high lead levels doubled after the water source switch.The Washington Post reported that 80 percent of the settlement would go to residents who were exposed when they were under 18 years old.The city and state have since taken steps to improve water quality, including reverting to a cleaner water source and a project to replace Flint’s ageing pipe network.Last week the city said it would complete the replacement of lead-tainted pipes by November 30, more than a year later than promised.Criminal charges filed against eight people accused of playing a role in the health debacle, including high-ranking state officials, were dropped last year.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/russia-to-test-coronavirus-vaccine-on-40000-people/,Russia to test coronavirus vaccine on 40,1,"MOSCOW, Russia (AFP) — Russia said on Thursday it would start clinical trials of its controversial coronavirus vaccine next week, involving tens of thousands of people.President Vladimir Putin said earlier this month that Russia had become the first country to register a coronavirus vaccine, though the announcement was met with caution from scientists and the World Health Organization who said it still needed a rigorous safety review.Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, which finances the vaccine project, said in a statement Thursday that tests of the “immunogenicity and safety of the Sputnik V vaccine” will begin next week involving more than 40,000 people.It said the tests were the equivalent of the Phase 3 trials that other vaccines are undergoing.Kirill Dmitriyev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, told an online briefing that the vaccination of at-risk groups, including medical personnel, would also start next week on a voluntary basis.More than 20 countries have made requests to purchase over a billion doses of the vaccine, he said, adding that Russia had agreements with several countries to produce it.He said mass vaccinations in Russia are expected to start in October and the first foreign deliveries in November or December.The vaccine — named after the pioneering 1950s Soviet satellite — was announced with much fanfare in Russia but drew warnings from Western scientists that Moscow may be moving too quickly.Dmitriyev said scepticism was starting to wane.“We have seen a significant change in tone from the WHO. At first, yes, they did not have enough information on the Russian vaccine, now official information has been sent and they will evaluate it,” he said.But he added: “We do not see any obstacle for individual regulators to approve the Russian vaccine without the approval of the WHO.”Russia had registered more than 942,000 confirmed coronavirus infections as of Thursday, the fourth-highest number after the United States, Brazil and India, and more than 16,000 deaths.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/stem-cell-treatment-offers-new-hope-for-diabetics/,000 people,1,"TOKYO, Japan (AFP) — A new method to create insulin-producing pancreatic cells from stem cells and protect them from the body’s immune system could pave the way for improving experimental diabetes treatment.In type-1 diabetes, the body turns on itself and attacks the so-called beta cells inside clusters in the pancreas called “islets”.These beta cells are responsible for gauging sugar levels in the blood and releasing insulin to keep them stable. When they are depleted, a person is at risk for either high or low blood sugar and has to rely on insulin injections.One treatment devised to end that reliance involves transplanting donor islets into diabetics, but the process is complicated by several obstacles.There are not enough donors, especially as one transplant generally requires several to ensure enough islets are available.Islets also often fail to connect with blood supply, and even when they do, like other transplants, they risk attack from the immune system of the recipient, which sees it as an invasion.As a result, patients have to take drugs that suppress their immune systems, protecting their transplant but exposing the rest of their body to other illness.In a bid to overcome some of these challenges, a team looked to find another source for islets, by coaxing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) to produce what the team called HILOs, or human islet-like organoids.These HILOs, when grown in a 3D environment mimicking the pancreas and then turbocharged with a “genetic switch”, successfully produced insulin and were able to regulate blood glucose function after being transplanted into diabetic mice.Having found a potential way to solve the supply chain problem, the scientists then sought to tackle the issue of immune rejection.They focused on something called PD-L1, a kind of protein that is known to inhibit the body’s immune response.When the team induced the HILOs to produce PD-L1, they were effectively able to “hide” the transplants from the body’s immune system, protecting them from attack.They transplanted HILOs both with and without PD-L1 into diabetic mice to test the function.Initially, both transplants worked to restore control of blood glucose levels, but gradually, the unprotected HILOs stopped functioning.But the HILOs with PD-L1 continued to help the diabetic mice regulate their blood glucose for more than 50 days.“This is the first study to show that you can protect HILOs from the immune system without genetic manipulation,” said Michael Downes, senior staff scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and a co-author of the study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.“If we are able to develop this as a therapy, patients will not need to take immune-suppressing drugs,” he added in a statement issued by Salk.Around 422 million people worldwide were living with diabetes by 2014, according to the World Health Organisation, a figure that includes both type-1 and type-2 diabetes.Islet transplantation is generally considered as a treatment for type-1 diabetics, whose disease is the result of an auto-immune response.But while the prospect of individually grown islets derived from stem cells might appear an attractive solution, the study warns that is likely to be “prohibitively expensive.”A more likely application of the research might be to use the PD-L1 protection method to allow successful transplants without the need for immunosuppressants, the authors wrote.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/test-trace-crucial-but-wont-beat-coronavirus-alone-study/,Stem cell treatment offers new hope for diabetics,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Testing for COVID-19 and tracing the prior contacts of those found to be infected are crucial measures for slowing the disease’s spread, but inadequate unless combined with other measures, researchers said Wednesday.By itself, the test-and-trace approach can reduce the virus’ reproduction rate, or R number, by 26 percent, they reported in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, using mathematical models to examine data from previously published studies.The reproduction rate measures the number of people in a population, on average, infected by each person carrying the virus.Anything above “1” means the disease is continuing to expand; below that threshold, it will eventually peter out.Some countries that brought the spread of COVID-19 under control but are now struggling to prevent a resurgence have R numbers well above 1.In France, for example, it hovered at about 1.33 during the first week of August, according to national health authorities.But the new finding comes with a caveat, said lead author Nicholas Grassly, a professor at Imperial College’s School of Public Health.“Our results show that test and trace can help reduce the R number but needs to be carried out effectively and quickly to do so,” he said in a statement.Concretely, that means immediate testing with the onset of symptoms and results within 24 hours; the quarantine of contacts, also within 24 hours; and the identification of 80 percent of cases and contacts.Very few countries — notably South Korea, Taiwan and Germany — have come close to staying within these guidelines, and most are still falling well short.In France, for example, it generally take days to get an appointment for a so-called PCR nasal test, and on average 3.5 days for a result, according to official figures.In the United States and the UK, delays can be even longer.Even if nations do adhere to these guidelines, it will still not be enough to bring the infection rate down sufficiently by itself, the new study concludes.“Test and trace alone won’t be enough to control transmission in most communities, and other measures alongside will be needed to bring the R number below 1,” said Grassly.Weekly screening of high-risk groups such as health and social-care workers — regardless of whether they have symptoms or not — can reduce transmission by an additional 23 percent, his team found.Experts are still unsure as to what percentage of a population must be immune — a threshold known as “herd immunity” — to prevent the virus from continuing to spread.Estimates range from below 50 to 70 percent.It is possible that some of the hardest hit regions — New York City, northern Italy — may be close to these levels, but at a national scale the numbers are still far lower, probably barely in double digits.WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said Tuesday that the planet was “nowhere close to the levels of immunity required to stop this disease”.People should “not live in hope of herd immunity being our salvation. Right now, that is not a solution,” he added.A vaccine, of course, would also provide immunity, but is unlikely to be available until next year.Currently, only people who have fought off COVID-19 and survived have some degree of immunity, though it remains unclear how robust it is and how long it lasts.It is also unclear the extent to which people with mild or asymptomatic cases have immunity at all.The novel coronavirus has killed nearly 775,000 people and infected almost 22 million since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.© Agence France-Presse"

It would be produced locally.Brazil chose a similar model, ordering 100 million doses from AstraZeneca, and partnering with China’s Sinovac to produce 120 millions of “CoronaVac,” which is already undergoing testing with Brazilians.Clinical tests of two Chinese vaccine candidates — Sinovac and Sinopharm — are well underway but only a few international partnerships have been announced, the one with Brazil and a possible one with Indonesia.Russia said 20 nations have pre-ordered one billion doses of Sputnik V and that with foreign partners it would be able to produce 500 million doses a year in five countries.The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), launched in 2017 by Norway, India, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, seeks to ensure that there is “equitable access” to future vaccines.It has pre-ordered 300 million doses from AstraZeneca for dozens of developing countries in a partnership with The Vaccine Alliance (Gavi).Billions of doses would be produced for Asia and elsewhere by the giant Serum Institute of India (SII), the largest vaccine producer in the world.Novavax and AstraZeneca have separately signed agreements with SII to produce a billion doses each for India and low- and middle-income countries on the condition, of course, that they prove their efficacy in clinical trials.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/mauritius-struggles-to-contain-oil-spill-polluting-its-seas/,Pre-orders of COVID-19 vaccine top five billion,1,", (AFP) — Police in Mauritius on Sunday prepared to board a grounded ship leaking tonnes of oil into its crystal-clear waters, as clean-up crews confronted a growing ecological disaster on the archipelago’s pristine shores.The bulk carrier MV Wakashio has been seeping fuel into a protected marine park boasting unspoiled coral reefs, mangrove forests and endangered species, prompting Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth to declare an environmental emergency and appeal for international help.Attempts to stabilise the stricken vessel, which ran aground on July 25 but only started leaking oil this week, and pump 4,000 tonnes of fuel from its hold have failed, and local authorities fear rough seas could further rupture the tanker.Hundreds of volunteers, many smeared head-to-toe in black sludge, are marshalling along the coastline, stringing together miles of makeshift cordons in a desperate attempt to hold back the oily tide.But already, thick muck has inundated the island nation’s unspoiled lagoons, marine habitats and white-sand beaches, causing unprecedented damage to the fragile coastal ecosystem upon which Mauritius and its economy relies.“People have realised that they need to take things into their hands. We are here to protect our fauna and flora,” said Ashok Subron, an environmental activist at Mahebourg, one of the worst-hit areas.Police said Sunday they would execute a search warrant granted by a Mauritius court to board the Wakashio and seize items of interest, including the ship’s log book and communication exchanges, as part of its investigation into the accident.The ship’s captain, a 58-year-old Indian national, will accompany officers on the search, police officials said. Twenty crew members evacuated safely from the Japanese-owned but Panamanian-flagged ship when it ran aground are under surveillance.Prime Minister Jugnauth thanked France for dispatching a naval vessel, military aircraft and technical experts from nearby Reunion, a French Indian Ocean island, to assist with the disaster.He has convened a crisis committee later Sunday, and has expressed concern that forecast bad weather could further complicate efforts to stymie the spill, and cause more structural damage to the vessel.The opposition has called for the resignation of the country’s environment and fisheries ministers, as pressure mounts on the government to explain why more wasn’t done to prepare in the two weeks since the ship ran aground.Mitsui OSK Lines, which operates the vessel owned by another Japanese company, said efforts to place containment booms near the ship had been unsuccessful due to high waves. Helicopters had been shifting some of the 3,800 tonnes of fuel and 2,000 tonnes of diesel to land.Aerial images show the enormous scale of the damage, with huge stretches of azure seas around the marooned cargo ship stained a deep inky black, and the region’s fabled lagoons and inlets clouded over.The Wakashio struck a reef at Pointe d’Esny, an ecological jewel fringed by idyllic beaches, colourful reefs, sanctuaries for rare and endemic wildlife, and unique RAMSAR-listed wetlands.Mauritius and its 1.3 million inhabitants depend crucially on its seas for food and for ecotourism, and has fostered a reputation as a conservation success story and a world-class destination for nature lovers.Ecologists fear if the ship further breaks it could inflict potentially catastrophic damage on the island nation’s coastline, which forms the backbone of the economy.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/asymptomatic-coronavirus-carriers-have-high-viral-loads-study/,Mauritius struggles to contain oil spill polluting its seas,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — People who are infected with the coronavirus carry similar levels of the pathogen in their nose, throat and lungs whether they have symptoms or not, a new study from South Korea showed Thursday.The paper, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, is an important biological line of evidence in support of the idea that asymptomatic carriers can spread COVID-19.Until now, experts have relied on inferring asymptomatic spread when people contract the virus without contact with a known carrier.A team of researchers led by Seungjae Lee at Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine analyzed swabs taken between March 6 and March 26 from 303 people isolated at a center in Cheonan, following an outbreak among a religious group in another city.The group ranged in age from 22 to 36 and two-thirds were women. Of the total, 193 were symptomatic and 110 were asymptomatic.Among those who were initially asymptomatic, 89 never developed symptoms at all — about 30 percent of the total.This finding itself helps gives a sense of what portion of infected people are truly asymptomatic rather than merely “presymptomatic,” a subject of confusion.All were sampled at regular intervals after day eight of isolation, and the samples returned comparable values of the virus’ genetic material from the upper and lower airways.The median time taken for the patients to return negative tests was marginally less for asymptomatic patients compared with symptomatic: 17 and 19.5 days, respectively.The authors wrote their findings “offer biological plausibility” to reports of asymptomatic transmission.But they added that their study only looked at the amount of viral genetic material present and did not attempt to follow the subjects to see if that translated to the spread of infectious virus.© Agence France-Presse"

The WHO began pressing China in early May to invite in its experts to help investigate the animal origins of COVID-19.The UN health agency sent an epidemiologist and an animal health specialist to Beijing on July 10 to lay the groundwork for a probe aimed at identifying how the virus entered the human species.Their scoping mission is now complete, said Tedros.“The WHO advance team that travelled to China has now concluded their mission to lay the groundwork for further joint efforts to identify the virus origins,” he said.“WHO and Chinese experts have drafted the terms of reference for the studies and programme of work for an international team, led by WHO.“The international team will include leading scientists and researchers from China and around the world.“Epidemiological studies will begin in Wuhan to identify the potential source of infection of the early cases.“Evidence and hypotheses generated through this work will lay the ground for further, longer-term studies.”The pair have not yet returned to the WHO’s Geneva headquarters for a debriefing.Scientists believe the killer virus jumped from animals to humans, possibly from a market in the city of Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat.Chinese officials said early in the outbreak that the virus may have spread from a market in the city, which sold live and wild animals, but no further confirmation of that has been revealed."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/plague-to-protein-israeli-firm-seeks-to-put-locusts-on-the-menu/,Plague to protein: Israeli firm seeks to put locusts on the menu,1,"GOLAN HEIGHTS, Undefined (AFP) — From biblical plague to modern day protein, one Israeli firm wants to make locusts a sustainable food choice in the Holy Land and beyond.As for whether or not the insects are kosher, the answer is not so simple.At Hargol Foodtech’s farm in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, a rectangular enclosure that once served as a chicken coop is filled with thousands of locusts, a grasshopper species that has a highly destructive swarming phase.Contained in a series of meticulously stacked, climate-controlled mesh cages, the insects are served wheatgrass through their three-month life-cycle, before being cooled, killed and baked.Hargol’s chief executive Dror Tamir told AFP that he grew up hearing stories of how locusts destroyed the fields of his kibbutz in the 1950s.Yet the Yemenite Jews in the area did not view locusts as crop-ruining pests, but as an edible source of nutrients, Tamir recalled.As an adult, Tamir became a food and nutrition entrepreneur increasingly concerned about the environmental cost of providing the world’s growing population with enough animal protein.Tamir said he founded Hargol — Hebrew for grasshopper — six and a half years ago after realising the insects were the solution.The company’s goal is to be “the first in the world to grow grasshoppers on a commercial scale, and provide the world with a healthier and more sustainable source of protein”.Ram Reifen, a professor of human nutrition at Hebrew University, agreed that the planet is facing growing food supply challenges.With Earth’s population expected to hit 10 billion by 2050, raising livestock to feed the planet will become increasingly unsustainable, given the massive water and land resources required.“The fear is there will be a scarcity of protein,” Reifen told AFP.Tamir said that unprocessed locusts consist of more than 70 percent protein and contain all amino acids, along with other nutrients.“What they do lack is saturated fat and cholesterol,” he said. “They have the good stuff. They don’t have the bad stuff.”According to his own estimate, around 2.5 billion people — mainly in developing nations — consume insects as part of their regular diet.And, the “most widely-eaten insects in the world are grasshoppers,” Tamir said.But, he added, “when trying to target North American and European customers, it’s really hard to overcome the ‘yuck’ factor”.To make their product more palatable to Westerners, Hargol turns locusts into powder, which can be mixed into various foods.Tamir said they were about to launch sales of locust-enhanced pancake mix and smoothie powders worldwide.Some goods produced in the Golan Heights face export restrictions, including strict labelling requirements, because most of the international community does not recognise Israeli sovereignty in the area.But Tamir said that while the locusts are grown in the Golan and another site in the Galilee, the powder is produced elsewhere within Israel, enabling him to avoid export restrictions.Investor support has helped sustain the company before sales tick up, he added.In the Bible, locusts appear in the Old Testament Book of Exodus as one of the Ten Plagues unleashed on the Egyptians to force the Pharaoh to free the Israelites from slavery.In Leviticus, there is a passage stating that certain kinds of grasshopper, including locusts, are kosher.Jews in Yemen and North Africa have been eating locusts for generations, but European, or Ashkenazi Jews have not.Tamir said he hoped that he could bring locusts into mainstream Israeli cuisine by getting a kosher certification for his product from the country’s chief rabbinate.Rabbi Eliezer Simcha Weisz, a member of the Chief Rabbinate Council, Israel’s top religious adjudication body, told AFP the “phenomenal issue” of whether locusts are kosher had been discussed at “great length”.And while the Torah designates some species as kosher — including the one raised by Tamir — it forbids others, he said.In the rabbinic literature of Ashkenazi Jews, “for the last 400 to 500 years, it’s specifically stated that we have a tradition to not eat these locusts,” he said.“That’s why it probably will not be accepted generally by all communities to eat the locusts,” he said, noting the chief rabbinate has put off a final decision on the question.But Weisz said that despite the complexity of getting approval from the chief rabbinate, a local Golan rabbi could approve the product.Overall, he said, the return of locusts to Jewish cuisine was “a wonderful thing”.“I think the fact that in the Torah it says you can eat them, it seems to indicate… that it could be the food of the future,” Weisz said.“Who would have thought!”Tamir remained optimistic the rabbinate would ultimately give its approval, noting support from prominent rabbis and a planned cooperation with Tnuva, Israel’s largest food producer, to manufacture locust protein powder for athletes by the end of the year.Meanwhile, Tamir is aiming his products at American and European Christians with grasshopper-enhanced energy bars and jars of roasted grasshoppers alongside Israeli honey.“According to the New Testament, John the Baptist used to eat locusts with honey,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/brazilian-amazon-fires-surge-in-july/,Brazilian Amazon fires surge in July,1,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AFP) — The number of forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon last month rose 28 percent from July 2019, satellite data showed Saturday, fueling fears the world’s biggest rainforest will again be devastated by fires this year.Brazil’s national space agency, INPE, identified 6,803 fires in the Amazon region in July 2020, up from 5,318 the year before.The figure is all the more troubling given that 2019 was already a devastating year for fires in the Amazon, triggering global outcry.That has put pressure on Brazil, which holds around 60 percent of the Amazon basin region, to do more to protect the massive forest, seen as vital to containing the impact of climate change.The fires are largely set to clear land illegally for farming, ranching and mining.Activists accuse Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right climate change skeptic, of encouraging the deforestation with calls to open up the rainforest to agriculture and industry.Under international pressure, Bolsonaro has deployed the army to fight the fires and declared a moratorium on burning. But activists say that does not go far enough to address the roots of the problem.Fires rose 77 percent on indigenous lands and 50 percent on protected nature reserves from July 2019, environmental group Greenpeace said, showing how illegal activities are increasingly encroaching on those areas.On July 30 alone, satellites detected 1,007 fires in the Amazon, INPE said.That was the worst single day for fires in the month of July since 2005, said Greenpeace.“More than 1,000 fires in a single day is a 15-year record and shows the government’s strategy of media-spectacle operations is not working on the ground,” Greenpeace spokesman Romulo Batista said in a statement.“On paper, the fire moratorium prohibits burning, but it only works if there is also a response on the ground, with more patrols. Criminals aren’t known for obeying the law.”Instead, the Bolsonaro administration has slashed the budget, staff and programs of environmental authority IBAMA.“Everything that was working was thrown out the window,” Erika Berenguer, an Amazon ecologist at Oxford and Lancaster Universities, told AFP.Fire season in the Amazon typically runs from around June to October.But fires are just part of the deforestation picture.The rest of the year, ranchers, farmers, miners and land speculators are clearing forest and preparing to burn it.The first six months of 2020 were the worst on record for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, with 3,069 square kilometers (1,185 square miles) cleared, according to INPE data — an area bigger than the nation of Luxembourg.If a significant portion of those felled trees burn in 2020, the result could be catastrophic, experts warn.“I think August will be the make-or-break month,” said Berenguer.Last year, the number of fires surged nearly 200 percent year-on-year in August, to 30,900, sending a thick haze of black smoke all the way to Sao Paulo, thousands of kilometers away, and causing worldwide alarm.The number of fires has fallen since then, under increased scrutiny and pressure — including from companies and investors worried about the impact on Brazil’s brand.But Berenguer said it was a matter of time before the newly deforested land went up in flames in the name of farming and ranching.“It’s an economic investment to deforest. It’s expensive…. You need heavy machinery: bulldozers, tractors, people, diesel,” she said.“You don’t deforest to leave all those trees on the ground. You need to burn it, because you need to recover your investment.”Furthermore, US space agency NASA warned last month that warmer ocean surface temperatures in the North Atlantic mean the southern Amazon is facing a major drought this year.It said that made “human-set fires used for agriculture and land clearing more prone to growing out of control and spreading.”“Conditions are ripe,” it said.Exacerbating the situation this year, experts say the resulting smoke risks causing a spike in respiratory emergencies in a region already hit hard by COVID-19.Brazil has more infections and deaths from the new coronavirus than any country except the United States: more than 2.6 million and 92,000, respectively.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/russia-vows-promising-virus-vaccines-in-september/,Russia vows ‘promising’ virus vaccines in September,1,"MOSCOW, Russia (AFP) — Russia said Wednesday that it plans to begin production of two “promising” coronavirus vaccines in September and October as Moscow races to develop a formula before Western countries.At a meeting chaired by President Vladimir Putin, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova singled out two vaccines under development by a research institute in Moscow and a lab in Siberia.“Today there are two vaccines that are the most promising,” Golikova said.Production of the first, which is being tested by the Moscow-based Gamaleya institute and the defence ministry, is set for September, Golikova said.Another vaccine being developed by the Vektor State labratory near the Siberian city of Novosibirsk should be launched in October, she added.Russia, which has the world’s fourth-largest coronavirus caseload, hopes to be the first country to produce a vaccine.Scientists in the West have raised concerns about the speed of development of Russian vaccines, suggesting that researchers might be cutting corners after coming under pressure from the authorities to deliver.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said it was important to achieve a finished product in a “careful and balanced way.”“One should be absolutely certain in a vaccine,” he said.Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund which is financing the Gamaleya trials, said the country hoped to be the first to approve a vaccine.“It’s a Sputnik moment,” he told US broadcaster CNN, referring to the launch in 1957 of the world’s first space satellite by Russia.“Russia will have got there first,” Dmitriev forecast.Russia has reported more than 828,000 coronavirus cases and 13,600 deaths so far."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-worked-well-in-monkeys-study/,Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine worked well in monkeys: study,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — US biotech firm Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine induced a robust immune response and prevented the coronavirus from replicating in the noses and lungs of monkeys, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine said Tuesday.The fact that the vaccine prevented the virus from replicating in the nose is seen as particularly crucial in preventing it from being transmitted onward to others.The same outcome did not occur when the University of Oxford’s vaccine was tested on monkeys, though that vaccine did prevent the virus from entering the animals’ lungs and making them very sick.In the Moderna animal study, three groups of eight rhesus macaques received either a placebo or the vaccine at two different dose levels — 10 micrograms and 100 micrograms.All vaccinated macaques produced high levels of neutralizing antibodies that attack a part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus used to invade cells.Notably, monkeys receiving both dose levels produced these antibodies at levels higher than those found in humans who have recovered from COVID-19.The authors reported that the vaccine also induced the production of a different immune cell known as T-cells that may have helped boost the overall response.A major area of concern is that vaccines under development could actually backfire by amplifying rather than suppressing the disease.So-called vaccine-associated enhancement of respiratory disease (VAERD) has been linked to the production of a specific type of T-cell known as Th2 — but these cells were not produced during the experiment, suggesting this vaccine won’t backfire.Four weeks after the monkeys received their second injection, they were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, both through the nose and directly to the lungs via a tube.After two days, no replicating virus was detected in the lungs of seven of the eight macaques in both the low and high dose groups.By contrast, all eight in the placebo group continued to have the virus present.None of the eight macaques in the high dose groups had detectable levels of virus in their noses two days after exposure.“This is the first time an experimental COVID-19 vaccine tested in nonhuman primates has been shown to produce such rapid viral control in the upper airway,” said the National Institutes for Health, which co-developed the vaccine.A COVID-19 vaccine capable of stopping the virus in the lungs will prevent the disease from becoming severe, while stopping the virus from replicating in the nose would lessen transmission.The Moderna vaccine uses genetic material in the form of viral RNA to encode the information needed to grow the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inside the human body to trigger an immune response.Spike proteins give coronaviruses their crown-like appearance and are used to invade human cells, but by themselves are thought to be relatively harmless.The advantage of this technology is that it bypasses the need to manufacture viral proteins in the lab, helping to ramp up mass production.Both Moderna’s vaccine and the vaccine co-developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca have entered late-stage human trials."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/israeli-firm-developing-30-second-coronavirus-breath-test/,Israeli firm developing 30-second coronavirus breath test,1,"MISGAV, Israel (AFP) — An Israeli company is developing a coronavirus breathalyser test that gives results in 30 seconds, billing it as a “front line” tool that can help restore a sense of normality during the pandemic.NanoScent, the firm making the test kits, said an extensive trial in Israel for the presence of live virus delivered results with 85 percent accuracy, and the product could receive regulatory approval within months.Chief executive officer Oren Gavriely told AFP the breathalyser would not replace lab tests, but was a mass screening tool that could help people gain “the confidence to go back and act as normal”.NanoScent has been operating for several years, specialising in rapid recognition technology, including for medical purposes.Gavriely said that while visiting the United States in January, he sensed his firm’s expertise may be needed to help confront the novel virus circulating in Asia that appeared to be spreading to the West.“We said we’ll invest one week into it and see what’s happening, and this one week never stopped,” he said.The test begins with a few short questions about COVID-19 exposure and symptoms, displayed on the phone of the person administering the procedure.Test subjects then inhale through the nose, hold their breath, close one nostril and exhale through the other, pushing breath through a handheld tube into a small bag called the “Air Trap”.The tube is then plugged into the “Scent Reader”, a small rectangular device that whirrs softly as it sucks the air out of the bag.Within seconds the results — “COVID-19 negative” during AFP’s visit — appear on the phone.Researchers at NanoScent’s headquarters in northern Israel are refining the virus recognition technology, which relies on “odours and the pattern of odours”, Gavriely said.After analysing the breath of roughly 1,000 Israeli COVID-19 patients, the firm was able to identify detectable smells associated with the virus, the chief executive added.“We pick up on a pattern, we record that pattern and then we can detect if someone has, or is suspected to have, COVID-19.”NanoScent’s technology was looking “very promising,” said Nadav Davidovitch, director of the school of public health at the Ben Gurion University in Beersheba.Mass testing is crucial during a pandemic, he told AFP, adding that the NanoScent test could be a useful tool, provided it gets regulatory approval.As long as NanoScent’s breathalyser was not used by some as a substitute for state-controlled lab tests, “I’m all for it”, he said.Gavriely told AFP he expected the test to be used at entrances to concerts and hospitals, or in the aviation industry — noting it was already being used at a major European sports venue, in a commercial pilot.If the breathalyser result is positive, people should automatically be sent for a lab test, he said.The device will likely cost less than $10 per test, “a fraction of the cost of the lab test”, Gavriely said.The Israeli defence ministry’s research and development directorate worked to help NanoScent develop its testing system, with department head Daniel Gold recently telling AFP that rapid testing would be a “game-changer” against the pandemic.Israel acted early against the virus in March and succeeded in reducing transmission to a trickle by early May, but as the economy has re-opened cases have spiked dramatically.The country of nine million people has been recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in recent weeks, forcing new restrictions and public anger over the purportedly mismanaged re-opening.Gavriely voiced hope that rapid, mass screening could help Israel strike a balance between essential restrictions and normal life.Scent recognition platforms are “a quick way to screen the masses and know who’s suspected, who’s not, so we can be confident again,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/much-maligned-elsewhere-bats-get-star-treatment-in-central-france/,Much maligned elsewhere,1,", At a museum in central France, researchers tenderly feed insects and kitten milk formula to tiny orphaned bats — creatures widely reviled for their role in human disease outbreaks, most recently COVID-19.The pandemic has triggered bat-killing sprees in communities from India and Peru to Cuba and Rwanda, but the mission of the team at the Bourges natural history museum is to protect the misunderstood winged mammals.Bats are vital pollinators and voracious consumers of harmful crop pests, yet are vilified as spreaders of disease and commonly portrayed in popular culture as blood-sucking parasites.“People are scared of illnesses,” said museum director Laurent Arthur, who has spent years studying and saving bats.“But COVID-19 is not transmitted by guano (bat droppings),” he insisted.Arthur and his team of specialists have identified over 1,500 bat colonies in the larger Bourges area, and keep meticulous tabs on their movements and wellbeing.Scientists believe the novel coronavirus which has killed more than 600,000 people worldwide to date, originated in bats and was passed to humans via an intermediary animal, possibly pangolins sold at Chinese meat markets.Bats were also believed to have been the origin of recent Ebola outbreaks in Africa.Bats -– of which there are over 1,200 species worldwide -– appear to have a unique immune system that may make them resistant to pathogens, passing them on without falling ill, according to retired epidemiologist Francois Moutou, who works with the museum.“As it is the only flying mammal, it consumes a lot of oxygen to feed its pectoral muscles,” said Moutou.High oxygen levels can damage DNA, so bats have evolved a gene repair toolkit credited with boosting its immune response, he added.According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), 60 percent of human infectious diseases originate from animals, including bats.This figure climbs to 75 percent for “emerging” diseases such as Ebola, HIV, avian flu, Zika, or SARS — another type of coronavirus.But humans, not animals, are to blame, according to researchers, who say the emergence of animal pathogens in our own species is most often associated with human encroachment on the creatures’ natural habitats.At the Bourges museum, they are working on ways to reduce the human impact on bats, for instance with a new type of insect trap that spares the bats who feed on them.They are also creating special bat nests in places where building upgrades have removed their access to rafters.The researchers are also moving whole colonies of bats to new homes in the vineyards of the Centre-Loire region.“Bats can hunt all the pests that destroy vineyards,” Arthur explained.One of the team’s core tasks is to rescue baby bats, called pups, that sometimes get left behind when colonies move.Researcher Aurelie Chretien patiently feeds tiny pipistrelle bats that weigh only a few grams each, using marker pens filled with kitten milk formula.For baby serotine bats, a larger species with sharp teeth, she employs a special leather glove, but no less tenderness.The feedings take place in the enclosed amphitheatre of the museum — making it easier to regather the baby bats in case of a mass flutter.With 30 years of dedicated bat study, the Bourges museum has become a go-to for scientific advice on the impact of large industrial projects, such as wind farms — which can be harmful for bats.Every two years, the museum hosts some 500 specialists from around the country to discuss all things bat.“We are the Mecca, the Lourdes or, for atheists, the Pantheon, for bats,” said Arthur.They also spread the message that bats are not the enemy.“We need to tell people that there are no risks. The problems reside in practices that we don’t have in France. Here, we don’t cook the animal, we don’t make bat stew,” said Moutou.Bats are eaten in some parts of Africa and Asia but there is no evidence that the practice is responsible for spreading disease to humans.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/dexamethasone-trial-results-confirm-covid-19-benefits-but-also-risks/,bats get star treatment in central France,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The keenly-awaited full results from a UK trial of the steroid dexamethasone were published Friday, confirming its life-saving benefits for COVID-19 patients on ventilators but suggesting it may cause harm if given too early.A total of 2,104 hospitalized patients were assigned to receive six milligram daily doses of the medicine for up to 10 days, and 4,321 to receive usual care, with the rate of deaths compared after 28 days.Among patients on ventilators, the rate of death for patients on the drug was 29.3 percent compared to 41.4 percent on those without.In other words, this group saw a 29 percent reduction in mortality, just under a third.In patients who were given oxygen but through less invasive means, the benefit was smaller — 23.3 percent on dexamethasone died versus 26.2 who were not on it.However, there was no benefit among the group who weren’t receiving any oxygenation at the time the trial started.In this cohort, 17.4 percent on the steroid died compared to 14 percent who did not receive it — suggesting the drug increased their mortality risk.This is because the drug works by suppressing the abnormal immune response that damages the body’s organs, rather than attacking the virus.Speaking to AFP in June, leading US scientist Anthony Fauci cautioned that dexamethasone should not be prescribed too soon after a person was infected.“It had no effect, if not maybe even a suggestion of making things worse early on,” he said.“This is perfectly compatible with knowing that early on in infection, you need the immune system to suppress the virus.”The authors of the paper, which appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine, added that getting benefit from the drug “is dependent on a selection of the right dose, at the right time, in the right patient.”They added that, as far as the COVID-19 illness is concerned, for patients who require oxygen, the abnormal immune response seems more responsible for harm than the replication of the virus in the body.But they cautioned that this hypothesis should not be applied to other viral respiratory illnesses, like SARS, MERS and influenza, without further study as they may have different impacts.Dexamethasone was adopted into UK practice on June 16, the day when the initial results were announced, and is also recommended by the US National Institutes of Health.On its website, the NIH cautions that it isn’t yet known how well dexamethasone might work in combination with the anti-viral drug remdesivir, which has proven beneficial when used alone.It adds that patients on the drug should be closely monitored for secondary infections and high blood sugar.It is also known that use of corticosteroids can also re-activate previous infections that were lying dormant, like the hepatitis B virus or tuberculosis.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/vaccine-studies-offer-new-hope-as-who-warns-on-africa/,Actor Michael V says he is COVID-19 positive,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — Two studies offered new hope of a potential vaccine for the novel coronavirus on Monday, as the World Health Organization warned about a possible acceleration of the disease in Africa.Seven months after COVID-19 was first identified in China and has since killed more than 600,000 people worldwide and battered economies, there is growing alarm over fresh outbreaks of the disease.Until recently, Africa had remained relatively unscathed by the pandemic compared to other parts of the world.But the situation has become increasingly worrying, particularly in South Africa, where the death toll passed 5,000 mark and the number of infections reached 350,000 at the weekend.And the WHO’s emergencies chief Michael Ryan told a virtual news conference in Geneva that the situation in South Africa could be seen as “a warning” for what the rest of the continent might have in store.“I am very concerned right now that we are beginning to see an acceleration of disease in Africa,” he said. Meanwhile, as European leaders in Brussels struggled to salvage a 750-billion-euro coronavirus aid package for the EU, two studies published in The Lancet medical journal appear to show progress towards a vaccine.One trial among more than 1,000 adults in Britain found that a vaccine induced “strong antibody and T cell immune responses” against the coronavirus.A separate trial in China involving more than 500 people showed most had developed widespread antibody immune response.“If our vaccine is effective it is a promising option as these types of vaccine can be manufactured at large scale,” said co-author Sarah Gilbert from the University of Oxford.British biotech firm Synairgen also said on Monday a randomized trial of an aerosol-based treatment shows it could drastically reduce the number of new coronavirus patients dying of the disease or requiring intensive care.Europe has been the worst-hit continent by the pandemic with more than 200,000 deaths, but European Union leaders remain bitterly split on how to help member countries like Italy and Spain, which have suffered the highest death tolls, but which have the heaviest debt burdens.On a fourth day of a summit marked by furious rows between the 27 countries, EU Council chief Charles Michel said Monday he believed a deal was in reach.“I know that the last steps are always the most difficult, but I’m confident,” Michel told reporters.“I think that even if it is difficult, even if it will be important to continue to work, I think and I am convinced that an agreement is possible.” In the United States — the worst-hit country in the world with more than 60,000 new cases reported daily for six days — president Donald Trump, who for months refused to encourage mask wearing as a way to combat the coronavirus, tweeted a picture of himself with his face covered and touted his patriotism.“We are United in our effort to defeat the Invisible China Virus, and many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can’t socially distance,” Trump wrote.“There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favorite President!”With close to 3.8 million cases and more than 140,000 deaths, American authorities are struggling to contain the surge and Trump has been criticised for his response to the crisis. Many countries in the continent had largely brought their outbreaks under control and were considering further easing of restrictions before fresh clusters were detected.Governments are struggling to balance public health concerns against the need to open up economies crippled by months of virus lockdowns.France has made face masks compulsory in public indoor spaces, Spain asked millions to stay at home again, while the German state of Bavaria said it would soon offer free virus tests at airports.Spain’s Catalan regional government has urged residents of Barcelona and its suburbs to leave their homes only for essential tasks in a bid to slow a new outbreak.On Monday, Spain’s southeast Murcia region also closed bars and clubs without terraces, limited group gatherings and restricted visits to retirement homes.French authorities have reported 400 to 500 active outbreak clusters but there are no signs of an imminent “second wave,” Health Minister Olivier Veran said Monday.But an anti-mask demonstration in London on Sunday highlighted the challenge still facing governments and health experts, despite the mounting COVID-19 toll.Dozens gathered to protest the face mask requirement in England’s shops and supermarkets, many of them holding banners with widely discredited conspiracy theories — such as coronavirus prevention measures being used for “mind control”.Despite the vocal and stubborn opposition to lockdowns and face masks in some parts of the world, they remain among the few options for authorities to control new outbreaks in the absence of a vaccine.There was grim evidence of how quickly the virus can spread over the weekend, with Iran’s president saying an estimated 25 million people in the country have already been infected.While Hong Kong’s daily case count of 108 on Sunday was far below other parts of the world, city authorities tightened distancing measures further, pointing to the fear of uncontrolled infections."

Interferon beta is a naturally occurring protein, commonly used to treat multiple sclerosis.It forms part of the body’s natural fight against infection, and the novel coronavirus suppresses its production in an attempt to evade an immune response.Delivering the protein directly into the lungs of patients is designed to trigger a robust immune response to the virus, even in patients whose immune system is already weakened by infection.“The results confirm our belief that interferon beta… has huge potential as an inhaled drug to be able to restore the lung’s immune response,” said Tom Wilkinson, professor or respiratory medicine at the University of Southampton.He said the trial showed SNG001 was effective in “enhancing protection, accelerating recover and countering the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus.”Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow said the new treatment “could be a game changer”.“With small (trial) numbers comes less certainty on the true level of benefit, or whether benefits vary between people with differing risk characteristics,” said Sattar, who was not involved in the research.“Such work would require a larger trial but, even so, these results are very exciting.”There are currently a number of treatments available for patients hospitalised with COVID-19.Last month a Britain-based team of researchers lead by the University of Oxford announced they had successfully reduced the risk of death among seriously ill patients by administering the commonly available steroid dexamethasone.Several countries have also issued the emergency authorisation for treatment with anti-viral remdesivir."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/vaccination-levels-falling-during-pandemic-un-warns/,Vaccine studies offer new hope as WHO warns on Africa,1,"The number of children worldwide getting life-saving vaccinations has declined this year largely because of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization and UNICEF warned on Wednesday.The first four months of 2020 saw a “substantial drop” in the completion of the three-dose jab that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough — the first decline in 28 years.“Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools in the history of public health, and more children are now being immunised than every before,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.But he said the pandemic had put those gains at risk.“The avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunisations could be far greater than COVID-19 itself,” he said in a statement.During the pandemic crisis at least 30 measles vaccination campaigns have been cancelled or are at risk, the two UN agencies said in a joint statement.As of this May, the pandemic had disrupted immunisation programmes in three-quarters of more than 80 nations responding to a UN survey conducted with the US Centres for Disease Control.Reluctance to leave home, transport problems, economic hardship, restrictions on movement or fear of being exposed to the virus were among the reasons given for the slowdown in immunisations. “COVID-19 has made previously routine vaccination a daunting challenge,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henriette Fore.“We must prevent a further deterioration in vaccine coverage … before children’s lives are threatened by other diseases.“We cannot trade one health crisis for another.”Progress on immunisation coverage was already stalling before the new coronavirus hit, the UN agencies said.Malaria and the diphtheria, tetanus and whopping cough jab — known as DTP3 — had reached about 85 percent of the target age group worldwide.“The likelihood that a child born today will be fully vaccinated with all the globally recommended vaccines by the time she reaches the age of five is less than 20 percent,” they said in the statement.In 2019, some 14 million children missed out on life-saving vaccines.Two-thirds of them are in 10 countries: Angola, Brazil, DR Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, and The Philippines.In Latin America and the Caribbean, historically high rates of vaccination have slipped, the UN reported.In Brazil, Bolivia, Haiti and Venezuela, immunisation coverage has dropped by at least 14 percent over the last decade."

India’s IT hub Bangalore has already started a week-long lockdown.Authorities in Australia, meanwhile, pleaded Wednesday with the public to heed social distancing guidelines, with roughly five million people in Melbourne in lockdown since last week in a bid to contain a new outbreak.That request came just days after a group was fined Aus$26,000 (US$18,200) when their house party was exposed by an unusually large order of KFC.“A particular concern for us is the ongoing parties and gatherings — people playing poker, people holding parties,” said Rick Nugent, acting assistant commissioner of Victoria state.“Please stop.” Such pleas from experts and authorities have been ignored and even mocked in many of the world’s most populous parts, including the United States — the worst-hit nation in the world.Tens of thousands of cases are now being reported every day in the US as authorities scramble to roll back reopenings. The national 24-hour infection count was more than 63,000 on Tuesday, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker.Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, again warned Americans against carelessness — especially young people who may feel they are not vulnerable and would rather be “sipping my margarita at a bar in a crowd”.Given asymptomatic transmission, such young people “need to understand that given the nature of this outbreak… You are inadvertently propagating the pandemic, you are part of the problem and not the solution”, Fauci said at an online Georgetown University event on Tuesday.Hopes rose, however, when American biotech firm Moderna said it would start the final stage of human trials for its vaccine candidate on July 27, after promising results from earlier testing.Moderna is considered to be in a leading position in the global race to find a vaccine, and while its study should run until October 2022, preliminary results should be available long before then. With no vaccine or effective treatment widely available, experts have advised lockdowns and social distancing measures in some form to prevent the deadly pandemic from gaining even more momentum.Face masks will become compulsory in England’s shops and supermarkets from next week, while South Africa reimposed a nationwide curfew to prevent a “coronavirus storm”.Authorities worldwide are under immense pressure to ease the economic pain caused by the widespread lockdowns, however, with the poorest hit the hardest.In Cairo, Zeinab, a young mother, was struggling to survive by selling tissues when the coronavirus hit — leaving her and thousands of other homeless people and street children even more vulnerable.With fewer people in the streets, she said, “we have less work and less money”. © Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/baby-infected-with-covid-19-in-the-womb-study/,Baby infected with COVID-19 in the womb: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Doctors in France have described what they said was the first confirmed case of a newborn infected in the womb with COVID-19 by the mother.The baby boy, born in March, suffered brain swelling and neurological symptoms linked to COVID-19 in adults, but has since recovered, they reported Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.Earlier research had pointed to the likely transmission of the virus from mother to foetus, but the study offers the first solid evidence, said senior author Daniele De Luca, a doctor at Antoine Beclere Hospital near Paris.“We have shown that the transmission from the mother to the foetus across the placenta is possible during the last weeks of pregnancy,” he said.Last week, researchers in Italy said that data on 31 pregnant women hospitalised with COVID-19 “strongly suggested” that the virus could be passed on to unborn infants.A JAMA study in March reporting on a similar number of pregnant COVID-19 patients came to a similar conclusion.But evidence remained circumstantial.“You need to analyse maternal blood, amniotic fluid, the newborn’s blood, the placenta, et cetera,” De Luca said by phone.“Getting all of these samples during a pandemic with emergencies everywhere has not been easy. This is why it has been suspected but never demonstrated.”De Luca and his team pulled together this data for the case of a pregnant woman in her twenties admitted to his hospital in early March.Because the baby was delivered by caesarean section, all of the potential sources and reservoirs of the virus remained intact.The concentration of SARS-CoV-2, the technical name given to the virus, was highest in the placenta, the researchers found.“From there it passed through the umbilical cord to the baby, where it develops,” De Luca said. “That is the pathway of transmission.”The baby began to develop severe symptoms 24 hours after birth, including severe rigidity of the body, damage to white matter in the brain, and extreme irritability.But before doctors could settle on a course of treatment, the symptoms began to recede. Within three weeks, the newborn had almost fully recovered on his own.Three months later, his mother is without symptoms.“The bad news is that this actually happened, and can happen,” De Luca said. “The good news is that it is rare — very rare compared to the global population.”Among the thousands of babies born to mothers with COVID-19, no more than one or two percent have tested positive for the virus, and even fewer show serious symptoms, said Marian Knight, a professor of maternal and child population health at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the research.“The most important message for pregnant women remains to avoid infection through paying attention to hand washing and social distancing measures,” she said.Others said the case study shed light on how the virus passes from mother to child.“This report adds knowledge to a possible mechanism of transfer to the baby, via the placenta,” commented Andrew Shennan, a professor of obstetrics at King’s College London.“But women can remain reassured that pregnancy is not a significant risk factor for them or their babies with COVID-19.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/strong-evidence-mothers-can-transmit-virus-to-newborns/,‘Strong evidence’ mothers can transmit virus to newborns,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — There is “strong evidence” that COVID-19- positive mothers can pass the virus on to their unborn infants, scientists said Thursday, in findings that could affect how pregnant women are shielded during the pandemic.While there have been isolated cases of babies infected with the virus, the findings show the strongest link yet between mother and infant transmission.Researchers in Italy studied 31 pregnant women hospitalised with COVID-19, and found the virus in an at-term placenta, umbilical cord, the vagina of one woman and in breast milk.They also identified specific COVID-19 antibodies in the umbilical cords of several pregnant women as well as in milk specimens.Claudio Fenizia, from the University of Milan and lead study author, said the findings “strongly suggest” that in-vitro transmission is possible.“Given the number of infected people worldwide, the number of women that could be affected by this could be potentially very high,” he told AFP.Fenizia stressed that none of the infants born during the study period tested positive for COVID-19.“Although in utero transmission seems to be possible, it is too early to clearly assess the risk and potential consequences,” he said.The World Health Organization said last month that new mothers infected with COVID-19 should continue breastfeeding.“We know that children are at relatively low-risk of COVID-19, but are at high risk of numerous other diseases and conditions that breastfeeding prevents,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.Among other findings, the team identified a specific inflammatory response triggered by COVID-19 in the women’s placenta and umbilical cord blood plasma.Fenizia said that the women studied were all in their third trimester, given the timeframe of Italy’s epidemic, adding that more research is currently under way among COVID-19-positive women in the early stages of pregnancy.“Our study is aimed at raising awareness and inviting the scientific community to consider the pregnancy in positive women as an urgent topic to further characterise and dissect,” he said.“I believe that promoting prevention is the safer advice we could possibly give right now for these patients.”The study was released during a week-long International AIDS Conference, held online for the first time in its history due to the pandemic."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/state-officials-respond-to-hawaiis-largest-single-day-count-of-new-covid-19-cases/,State officials respond to Hawaii’s largest single-day count of new COVID-19 cases,1,"HONOLULU (Eagle News) – The Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH) announced on Tuesday, July 7, that there were 41 new cases of COVID-19, the highest case count since the pandemic began in early March. Thirty-eight (38) were in Honolulu/Oahu, one (1) in Big Island, and two (2) in Kauai.Governor David Ige has assured that the new COVID-19 cases are still manageable.“It is the highest we’ve had, and it is concerning. However, as we re-opened our economy, we expected this. We are tracking this very closely and it is manageable right now,” the governor stated. “We have the ability to test people we need to test, and DOH has significantly increased the number of people available to trace the contacts of positive cases.”Governor Ige also said he is in “daily discussions with DOH, the county mayors, and other leaders.”“As we have done in the past, we will continue to make decisions based on the best available science and facts. We have not made any decisions yet and will let you know as soon as any changes are necessary,” Ige said.DOH officials are reminding everyone that there can be a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases as levels of activity increase within the Aloha State.“Now more than ever, it is critically important for everyone to wear a cloth face mask whenever outside of their home. Many of the clusters we have been investigating are associated with situations where a mask has not been worn or physical distancing was not exercised. These are new infections that are not associated with known cases and investigations,” DOH Director Dr. Bruce Anderson said. “We have an opportunity now to turn around these numbers before opening travel and safely resuming school and work. Let’s take this opportunity to all wear masks and do our part to prevent COVID-19.”State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park added, “This latest report shows COVID-19 is widely circulating in our community. The numbers today will likely continue, at least at this level, if people continue to disregard using their masks and physical distancing. While we have an increased number of staff at DOH and are in the process of hiring newly trained contact tracers, the community must adhere to safe practices, as no amount of contact tracing and testing will combat a respiratory pathogen alone.”To date, Hawaii has a total 1,071 confirmed cases, one of the lowest in the U.S."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/malnutrition-in-poorer-nations-costs-firms-up-to-850-billon-study/,Malnutrition in poorer nations costs firms up to $850 billon: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Hunger, poor nutrition and obesity not only present a health burden in developing countries but carry a hidden economic penalty that costs businesses up to $850 billion a year, according to a new report published Wednesday.Researchers said malnutrition reduces the resilience of populations to risks such as infectious disease outbreaks and extreme climate events, as well as causing a reduction in productivity and earnings.With the coronavirus pandemic expected to drive millions more into hunger and poverty, they called for governments and businesses alike to focus on nutrition as part of recovery efforts.“While the costs of undernutrition and overweight/obesity to societies and governments are well explored, the costs and risks to companies created by malnutrition in the workforce and the wider community have remained under the radar,” said lead researchers Laura Wellesley, a senior research fellow at Chatham House.“We show that the costs and risks are significant and that it is in the interests of businesses to take action.”The report, which was compiled with the Vivid Economics group, defined malnutrition as both undernutrition and overnutrition — encompassing conditions from stunting and anaemia to being overweight and obese.In developing nations where the prevalence of malnutrition is high, researchers estimated that the direct costs of productivity loss would total between $130 billion and $850 billion a year.That is equivalent to between 0.4 per cent and 2.9 percent of the combined gross domestic product of those countries.The report extrapolated the results from modelling 19 lower- and middle-income countries in Asia, Africa, Central America and Europe.According to the 2020 Global Nutrition Report, around one in nine people globally are hungry or undernourished, while one in three people are overweight or obese. Almost a quarter of children under five are stunted.Problems that once existed at opposite ends of the wealth spectrum are increasingly converging in poor and middle-income countries as populations, households and even individuals face a “double burden” of being overweight and undernourished.“Both obesity and undernutrition are outcomes of poor nutrition, and both should be tackled together if we’re to ease the malnutrition burden on companies and societies,” Wellesley said.She called for efforts to reduce both problems, such as paying a fair living wage, subsidising nutritious food for staff, providing breastfeeding support for mothers and education on how to eat healthily.The report stressed that action to tackle malnutrition is in businesses’ best interests.Direct costs for companies include the reduction in productivity associated with staff ill-health and limits to workers’ physical and cognitive capacity, Wellesley said.It also traps households into poverty meaning, they have less money to spend as consumers, thus impeding the development of a healthy workforce.The report comes as Philip Alston, the former United Nations envoy on extreme poverty and human rights, slammed the international community for fostering a misleading narrative that global poverty is being eradicated when in fact he said it is rising.He warned that the pandemic is expected to push hundreds of millions into unemployment and poverty, while increasing the number at risk of acute hunger by more than 250 million.“Even before COVID-19, we squandered a decade in the fight against poverty with misplaced triumphalism blocking the very reforms that could have prevented the worst impacts of the pandemic,” he said.Alston criticised the use of the World Bank’s international poverty line — currently $1.90 per day — as “flawed”, saying it gives a deceptively positive picture.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/global-experts-warn-of-covid-19-airborne-threat/,Global experts warn of COVID-19 airborne threat,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — As countries ease their lockdowns, authorities need to recognize the coronavirus can spread through the air far beyond the two meters (six feet) urged in social distancing guidelines, an international group of 239 scientists said Monday.In a comment piece that takes direct aim at the World Health Organization for its reluctance to update its advice, researchers recommended new measures including increasing indoor ventilation, installing high-grade air filters and UV lamps, and preventing overcrowding in buildings and transport.“There is significant potential for inhalation exposure to viruses in microscopic respiratory droplets (microdroplets) at short to medium distances (up to several meters, or room scale),” wrote the authors, led by Lidia Morawska of the Queensland University of Technology.“Hand washing and social distancing are appropriate, but in our view, insufficient to provide protection from virus-carrying respiratory microdroplets released into the air by infected people.”The new paper appears in the Oxford Academic journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.When an infected person breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes, they expel droplets of various sizes.Those above five to ten micrometers — which is less than the width of a typical human head hair — fall to the ground in seconds and within a meter or two.Droplets under this size can become suspended in the air in what is called an “aerosol,” remaining aloft for several hours and traveling up to tens of meters.There has been a debate in the scientific community about how infectious microdroplets are in the context of COVID-19.For the time being the WHO advises that the potential for infection from an aerosol occurs “in specific circumstances” mainly in hospitals, for example when a tube is placed down a patient’s airway.On the other hand, some studies of particular spreading events suggest that aerosolization and microdroplet transmission can happen in a variety of settings.The air flow from an air conditioning unit appeared to waft the coronavirus to several tables in a Chinese restaurant in January where patrons became infected, according to a study that appeared in Emerging Infectious Diseases.Another study that appeared in a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that the virus was spread by microdroplets from people singing during a choir practice in Washington state in March.Fifty-three people fell ill at that event and two died.That is in addition to the fact that bars jam-packed with people have also emerged as hotspots of contagion, with droplets of all sizes believed to contribute to the spread.Cath Noakes, a professor of environmental engineering for buildings at the University of Leeds, who contributed to the paper, said COVID-19 doesn’t spread in the air as easily as measles or tuberculosis, but is a threat nonetheless.“COVID-19 is more likely to be ‘opportunistically’ airborne and therefore poses a risk to people who are in the same room for long periods of time,” she added.The WHO advice is out of step with both the US CDC and its European counterpart.“We are aware of the article and are reviewing its contents with our technical experts,” the WHO said in response to the new commentary. The authors recognized that the evidence for microdroplet transmission was “admittedly incomplete,” but argued that the evidence for large droplets and surface transmission was also incomplete yet still formed the basis for health guidelines.“Following the precautionary principle, we must address every potentially important pathway to slow the spread of COVID-19,” they wrote.Put another way, “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,” said Julian Tang, an associate professor of respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester who contributed to the commentary.“The WHO say that there is insufficient evidence to prove aerosol/airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is happening. We are arguing that there is insufficient proof that aerosol/airborne transmission does not occur,” he said. ©"

But this is not unexpected and is not considered a stumbling block.The vaccine relies on messenger RNA, genetic code that slips into human cells to make them generate antibodies that are specifically tailored to the coronavirus.Several companies have published results from the initial phases of clinical trials stating that their experimental vaccines cause an immune system response.A total of 23 COVID-19 vaccine projects have launched clinical trials on humans, says the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.Several have moved to phase two or to phase three, when they are injected into thousands of volunteers to evaluate their effectiveness, monitor side effects and collect other information that will allow them to be used safely.A vaccine created by the US biotech firm Moderna and one from Oxford University in collaboration with British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca are among those which are in the most advanced stages of development, along with several Chinese projects.These include one from the company CanSinoBIO, which has received permission to administer the vaccine to Chinese soldiers.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/israel-wields-startup-tech-against-coronavirus-second-wave/,Australia starts virus testing blitz to curb surge in Melbourne,1,"TEL-AVIV, Israel (AFP) — Israel’s armoury in the battle against the novel coronavirus includes thermal cameras scanning crowds and algorithms trawling vast medical databanks for real-time indicators of an infection spike.The Jewish state is enlisting the help of local startups in the hope of stemming a “second wave” of the virus.The chaos of daily life in Israel, or “balagan” as it is known in Hebrew, stands in contrast with the seemingly calm efficiency of its hi-tech firms.It is where the two meet, at the crossroads of human behaviour and smart public health management, that the further spread of COVID-19 can be best avoided, says Ran Balicer, head of innovation at Clalit, Israel’s biggest health services provider.“We have to find a new status quo,” he told AFP. “We have to find a new normal” in balancing a less restricted economy and preventing a surge in infection.“The exact point of equilibrium is very difficult to guesstimate or to assess or to model,” he said.To achieve the goal, it is essential to “use the best technological tools to monitor the state of health of the population”, he said.That, he added, means collecting electronic data in real time so that public decision-makers can take swift and precise actions.Balicer said that at the start of the pandemic Clalit teams worked with the Israeli health ministry and local start-up Diagnostic Robotics to draft a questionnaire which people who suspect they have coronavirus symptoms can fill in and send on their smartphone.An algorithm then assesses the person’s probability of infection and cross-checks this information with that of “millions of others”, said Kira Radinsk, head of Diagnostic Robotics.“When the system identifies an increasing number of symptomatic cases, an alert is sent to the deputy director of the ministry of health who generally immediately approves a series of tests for the given location,” she told AFP.“This allows resources to be allocated quickly where they are needed,” such as imposing restrictions on a specific neighbourhood or town, without placing the entire economy in lockdown.Until recently Israel took pride in its COVID-19 figures of less than 20,000 confirmed infections and about 300 deaths in a population of nine million, low compared to counties in Europe and the Americas.But as it eased lockdown measures the numbers climbed, to the point where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Tuesday for the use of “digital solutions” to flatten the curve.Wendy Singer of Start-Up Nation Central, an organisation that promotes Israeli innovation, says that entrepreneurs had worked before on artificial intelligence projects with government and health professionals and academics.That experience, she said, made it possible to “just pivot in order to meet a corona-based challenge.”One example is Israeli facial recognition startup Anyvision, recently accused by rights groups of providing the country’s military with tools for mass surveillance in the Palestinian territories.Microsoft divested its holdings in Anyvision but later said that an independent audit of the firm’s practices indicated that the charges were untrue.Shortly after the outbreak of coronavirus Anyvision installed thermal cameras at Sheba Medical Centre near Tel Aviv, Israel’s largest hospital and its flagship facility in the battle against the pandemic.The heat-seeking system was deployed to let officials spot hospital staff with a fever.Its facial recognition software shows “in seconds” anyone who came into contact with an infected staffer and allows officials to determine precisely who should go into isolation, said Anyvision’s Alex Zilberman.“Imagine a nurse or a doctor who tested positive,” he said.“We would have had to call them on the phone and ask, ‘Who have you met in the past 14 days?'”“In a place like a hospital, where you meet thousands of people that’s impossible to answer”, he said.A profusion of cameras, identity-matching; how far is big data from Big Brother?“It’s a very powerful system,” says Anyvision’s Zilberman. “You need to make sure it’s being used in the right way and to do that we have multiple safeguards.”That includes making sure that access to the system is compartmentalised, with various actions limited to different levels of authorised users.To ease the load on hospitals, the Israeli government signed a deal with local startup Datos which offers a platform for remote medical care.Patients download an app and then measure their vital signs and input the results, generating data processed by the company’s algorithm.The system then sends reminders to patients or people in quarantine.“At the start of the (coronavirus) crisis, health services had to call patients twice a day regardless of their condition,” Datos founder Uri Bettesh told AFP.That was a drain on important resources, he said, adding that with his app there is only a need to make contact if the patient’s data shows it to be necessary, freeing up staff to focus on severe cases.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/un-says-covid-will-increase-the-risks-associated-with-drug-trafficking/,UN says Covid will increase the risks associated with drug trafficking,1,"Vienna, Austria (AFP) — The new coronavirus pandemic could hit drug markets just as the 2008 economic crisis did, exacerbating the risks for users, the UN drugs and crime agency warned Thursday. In its 2020 World Drug Report, the agency predicted an overall increase in drug use due to the pandemic, with a shift towards consuming cheaper products and injecting them, which carries greater risks.Countries were also likely to reduce drug-related budgets, it warned.They might also give less priority to interception operations and international cooperation, which would make it easier for traffickers to operate.Rising unemployment and a lack of opportunities would increase the chances that “poor and disadvantaged people… turn to illicit activities linked to drugs -– either production or transport”.“The COVID-19 crisis and economic downturn threaten to compound drug dangers further still, when our health and social systems have been brought to the brink and our societies are struggling to cope,” said UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly.“We need all governments to show greater solidarity and provide support, to developing countries most of all, to tackle illicit drug trafficking and offer evidence-based services for drug use disorders and related diseases.”The Vienna-based agency said it had reached its conclusions based on what had happened in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis.Border closures and other measures linked to the pandemic have already caused shortages of drugs on the street, leading to higher prices and reduced purity, the report noted.Drug traffickers seemed to rely more on maritime routes, such as direct cocaine shipments by sea from South America to Europe.Online trafficking via the darknet, which offers users total anonymity, and shipments by mail might also increase, it added.Drug consumption overall is already on the rise, especially in developing countries, said the report. While in 2009 an estimated 210 million people worldwide used drugs at least once, in 2018 that figure was closer to 269 million — or 5.3 percent of the global population.The report, which mostly examined data up to early 2019, also noted that use of cocaine and methamphetamine was rising, with the methamphetamine markets in Afghanistan and Iraq growing.Global cocaine production again reached an all-time high, continuing its record-setting trend. Cannabis remains the most widely used drug worldwide with an estimated 192 million users in 2018. But opioids, used by around 58 million people, remained the most harmful."

This generous donation will serve to strengthen the institutional response of the government of Guatemala to this pandemic.Through this goodwill gesture, President said that “They’re friends we have to honor such as the European Union.”These 72,000 tests may seem like a small amount, but in reality, this is a contribution to a country that is required to use many of its resources destined to emergency care.The symbolic donation took place in the facilities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs when the ambassador European Union in Guatemala, Mr. Stefano Gatto, and the representative of the Pan American Health Organization and World Health Organization in Guatemala, Mr. Oscar Barreneche, were in charge. The tests kits received, came from the European virus ICAR consulting—a group of 25 laboratories funded by the European Union, including the Institute of Medical immunology of the Charité University in Berlin.Endorsed by the standards of the World Health Organization, Ambassador Gatto indicated that the objective of this donation is to help raise the capacity of carrying out correctly the test to prevent the virus from spreading.This is not the first time the European Union has supported Guatemala. Since 1994, the EU has donated over 570 million Euros for humanitarian projects in Central America. Those funds was used to respond to humanitarian emergencies derived from natural disasters, relocation and humanitarian consequences of widespread organized violence, and to strengthen the preparedness of the most vulnerable communities and institutions for new emergencies.The most recent help received from the European Union was the 550,000 Euros in response to the damages caused by the tropical storm Amanda in May, which had a great impact in El Salvador and in Guatemala.© Eagle News"

If an authority or a judge orders us to stop the work, we are going to comply,” Lopez Obrador told his daily press conference.The “Maya Train” is meant to link Caribbean resorts such as Cancun and Playa del Carmen with ancient Mayan archaeological sites such as Palenque and Chichen Itza, passing through the impoverished interior of southeastern Mexico along the way.On Monday, a court ordered a temporary halt to work on the project to safeguard the “right to health” of the Ch’ol ethnic group for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a statement from indigenous advocacy group Indignation.The National Fund for the Promotion of Tourism (FONATUR), the government entity overseeing the project, said the measure will only be in force for the duration of the pandemic and was limited to work around the town of Palenque in Chiapas state.Activity on the site “has been reduced to essentials, taking place in open air, respecting the safety distance and the implementation of labor ministry protection protocols,” FONATUR said in a statement.Lopez Obrador has championed the project from the beginning of his presidency, saying the passenger and freight railroad will kick-start economic development in the region.But it has faced resistance from activists and some indigenous communities over the lack of clarity on the impact the rail line will have on the environment.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/russia-holds-grand-wwii-parade-ahead-of-vote-on-putin-reforms/,Court halts Mexico’s ‘Maya Train’ over indigenous health rights,1,"MOSCOW, Russia (AFP) — Columns of tanks and troops will parade through Red Square on Wednesday as President Vladimir Putin oversees grand World War II commemorations to stir up patriotic fervour ahead of a vote on extending his rule.Forced to postpone the country’s traditional May 9 Victory Day celebrations by the coronavirus pandemic, Putin rescheduled the parade for just a week ahead of a July 1 public vote on controversial constitutional reforms.Among other changes, the reforms Putin proposed earlier this year would reset the presidential term-limit clock to zero, allowing him to potentially stay in the Kremlin until 2036.He announced the new dates for the parade and the vote — initially planned for April — last month despite Russia still recording thousands of new coronavirus cases every day.The rate of new infections has fallen in recent weeks and cities including Moscow have lifted anti-virus lockdowns, but critics accuse Putin of rushing ahead with public events to pursue his own political ends.This year’s parade, marking 75 years since the Soviet Union’s defeat of Nazi Germany, will include some 13,000 troops from 13 countries, as well as vintage equipment and the latest military hardware showing off Russia’s fighting capabilities.More than 20 pieces of new equipment will be on show for the first time including Tosochka flame-throwers, T-90M tanks and Buk-M3 surface-to-air missile systems.Officials say the date was chosen to coincide with the anniversary of the first post-war parade on Red Square, which saw Soviet troops throw down Nazi standards in front of the Lenin mausoleum on June 24, 1945.In his two decades in office, Putin has harnessed the legacy of the Soviet Union’s victory in World War II to boost patriotic sentiment and support for his government.Ahead of the parade, he slammed the West for “insulting Russia” by playing down the USSR’s role in winning the war.Chinese leader Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron had been scheduled before the pandemic to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Kremlin chief at the parade, in a testament to Russia’s growing international influence under Putin.Now the Russian president will be flanked by the heads of breakaway statelets in the former Soviet Union and leaders of close allies like Serbia and Belarus.With more than 8,000 recorded fatalities and around 600,000 confirmed infections, Russia has the third-largest coronavirus caseload in the world after the United States and Brazil.The Kremlin said that safety precautions were being taken in the lead-up to the parade — but participants will not wear masks and there is still a ban on mass gatherings in Moscow.Dozens of regions have decided not to go ahead with their own commemorative parades, citing concerns that a spike in cases could overwhelm underfunded and poorly equipped hospitals throughout the country.Yet events marking the Soviet victory will go ahead in Saint Petersburg, Volgograd and Simferopol in Russian-annexed Crimea.Reflecting these concerns, both Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov have advised people to watch the procession on television rather than attend in person.War veterans quarantined ahead of the event in sanatoriums will be seated at intervals in the stands on Red Square.Precautions are also being taken for the constitutional vote, with early balloting starting on Thursday and continuing through to the official vote day on July 1.Chief opposition figure and one-time presidential hopeful Alexei Navalny has criticised authorities for spending vast sums on the parade and urged his supporters to boycott the ballot.“One crazy, greedy man who has gone mad with power is making the whole country engage in delirium,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"

Closed for 15 days,” says a hand-painted sign next to a roadblock at the entrance to the reserve, a 5,000-hectare (12,000 acres) territory in northern Brazil near the Peruvian and Colombian borders.As the new coronavirus has ravaged Brazil, the country with the second-highest death toll after the United States — 51,000 and counting — it has hit particularly hard among indigenous peoples, who have a tragic history of vulnerability to outside diseases.Isolated tribes have been decimated in the past by diseases such as measles and influenza.Now, there is widespread fear of the new coronavirus in the Amazon region, one of the areas hit hardest in Brazil.More than 7,700 indigenous people have contracted the virus in Brazil, and nearly 350 have died, according to the Brazilian Indigenous Peoples’ Association (APIB).It accuses the government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro of having “done nothing” to prevent the relentless spread of coronavirus among Brazil’s 900,000 indigenous people.Many indigenous groups are taking matters into their own hands.At the Umariacu reserve, the Ticuna people banned outsiders and put up a makeshift roadblock at the entrance to their territory, which sits on the outskirts of Tabatinga, a border city of 65,000 people.It was a difficult choice, but a necessary one, given the reserve sits near a triple frontier with heavy traffic, said its chief, Sildonei Mendes da Silva.“This pandemic has been very damaging,” he told AFP, wearing a black face mask printed with the words “indigenous health.”“We’re 15 minutes from Colombia, and people from there come here to buy our fish, fruit and other things” — a business that ground to a halt with the self-imposed quarantine.Unfortunately, the measure did not stop the virus entirely. Twenty-four people have been infected on the reserve, and two have died.At the entrance to the reserve, home to 7,000 inhabitants, the man coordinating Tabatinga’s response to the pandemic, Weydson Gossel Pereira, was monitoring traffic.“If anyone comes to the roadblock without a mask, we invite them to go back and get one,” he said.On the reserve, however, masks are rare, and crowds of people could be seen before a mass at the local church, apparently unconcerned with social distancing.APIB urged younger indigenous community members Monday to stay home when possible, to avoid spreading the virus to older relatives.“The virus is killing chiefs, elders and traditional healers,” it said.“The pandemic could cause irreparable damage to our communities’ knowledge of our culture, oral history and natural medicine.”Far up the Javary river, a tributary of the Amazon, the remote village of Cruzeirinho took a different approach.Rather than lock the world out, most villagers have fled into the jungle.“There are five families here in the village who didn’t want to leave for the forest. The rest want to take care of themselves and don’t want contact with anyone,” said resident Bene Mayuruna.A lone pair of chickens roamed behind him in the otherwise silent village, where people subsist mainly on cassava and fish from the river that forms the border with Peru.The refugees in the forest are not alone.“We are hearing reports from Peru, Indonesia, Colombia and Brazil of indigenous people fleeing from the coronavirus,” Oyvind Eggen, the head of the Rainforest Foundation Norway, said in a statement in April.“The corona crisis is creating additional pressure on what is already a very difficult situation for rainforest inhabitants.”The Brazilian army recently deployed a team of health workers to Cruzeirinho to provide care for the remaining members of the local tribe, the Mayuruna.Working with interpreters, they help community members combine their traditional remedies with modern medicine.The diagnosis in Cruzeirinho was a hopeful one, for now: no COVID-19 cases were found.© Agence France-Presse"

Each prospective investment will be judged on its potential to accelerate the path to zero carbon and help protect the planet for future generations.”The move follows an announcement by Bezos last year that Amazon would accelerate its own efforts to cut its carbon footprint while encouraging others to join his “Climate Pledge” aimed at meeting goals of the Paris accord on climate ahead of schedule.Since then, the pledge has been joined by other companies including US-based telecom giant Verizon, British consumer goods firm Reckitt Benckiser and India-based tech giant Infosys.Amazon has said it is on track to run on 100 percent renewable energy by 2025 and would become carbon neutral by 2040.It also will deploy more than 100,000 electric delivery vans to replace gasoline-powered vehicles for its logistics operations. The first will hit the road in 2021, with the fleet to be fully operational in 2030.The new fund will invest in companies in multiple industries, including transportation and logistics, energy generation, storage and utilization, manufacturing and materials, circular economy, and food and agriculture.Amazon will also seek other investors to add to the fund which is aimed at efforts to “decarbonize the economy and protect the planet.”The news comes amid growing concerns on climate change and with the US administration on course to withdraw from the global agreement aimed at curbing emissions.Some scientists have warned that climate change is accelerating, making mitigation efforts more urgent.The last five years have been the hottest on record, as has been the last decade, according to the European climate monitoring network.Amazon has faced criticism, including from some of its own employees, that it has failed to move quickly enough on climate change.The company, which is a major cloud computing service provider, says it has invested in 91 renewable energy projects around the globe.It has also made investments in reforestation projects around the world, and stepped up efforts to reduce its use of packaging materials.The company, which has expanded its workforce to meet consumer demands during the coronavirus pandemic, is also being scrutinized for its growing power in retail by lawmakers and antitrust enforcers.© Agence France-Presse"

Baca indicated that a series of health measures, such as testing, are still pending in the area.Machu Picchu unions have since Monday protested the reopening, saying that allowing tourists in the region would cause a spike in infections.Peruvian officials announced last week that the citadel would be allowed to reopen to a sharply reduced number of daily visitors: only 675 per day, one-quarter the usual number.Guides would lead tours of only seven visitors, and people would be required to wear masks.The planned July reopening was linked to a lifting of national confinement measures in place since March 16, Cusco regional governor Paul Benavente said.Airports in Peru remain closed, and many shops are shuttered.

But when the coronavirus crisis is over, will they amplify job losses?It may be a mechanised arm pulling beers in a Seville bar, a dog-like dispenser of hand sanitiser in a Bangkok mall, a cooler on wheels that delivers groceries in Washington, or a vaguely humanoid greeter at a Belgian hospital that also checks you are not running a fever.These are some of the new jobs that robots have taken on as lockdown measures have seen humans confined to their homes.“The moment there is a threat for humans, you should send a robot,” said Cyril Kabbara, co-founder of the French start-up Sharks Robotics.Its robot Colossus helped save Paris’ Notre Dame Cathedral when flames engulfed its roof in 2019, and has been adapted to help remove lead that contaminated the site.“Four or five years ago, when we went presented the Colossus, they laughed at us. The firefighters said: ‘These guys are going to take away our jobs’,” said the entrepreneur.But the Colossus has since been successfully integrated into the Paris and Marseille fire services.“The more we advance, the more the resistance falls away,” he said.It is not just in the hygiene and medical spheres where robots have made advances.“This crisis has demonstrated that you have to have a capacity to continue activity even when a health or another type of crisis strikes,” said Kabbara.“We’ve had quite a few manufacturers tell us that the robots allowed them to continue operating. And if they hadn’t had them, they’d be at a dead stop.”While owners like robots as they can keep operations running, workers can see them as a risk to their jobs.Rightly so, according to Brookings Institution researcher Mark Muro.“Recent research suggests that the deepening recession is likely to bring a surge of labour-replacing automation,” he said in a recent note for the Economist Intelligence Unit.“People who suggest that automation is not taking away jobs in manufacturing, they’re just wrong,” said Oxford University economist Carl Frey.He pointed to China, a country which is rapidly installing industrial robots, with 650,000 going online in 2018 alone, and which lost 12.5 million manufacturing jobs between 2013 and 2017.The country has seen an explosion in “robophobia” during the coronavirus crisis, according to a study by Spanish university IE.While only 27 percent of Chinese supported limiting automation before the crisis struck, the figure has doubled to 54 percent.The Chinese are now close to the French, who at 59 percent, are the most hostile to automation.The study also revealed that hostility towards automation was tied to age and education, with the younger and less educated people most hostile towards robots.“Historically, technology has created a lot of jobs as well, but you see less of that happening in the digital world,” said Frey.He pointed to automakers or manufacturers like General Electric still employing many workers even after adopting automation.“The leading techs of today are not creating so many jobs, apart from Amazon,” he told AFP.With the rapid progress made in artificial intelligence, white collar workers are increasingly at risk from automation, experts warn.“No group of workers may be entirely immune this time around,” said Muro.That is not to say that high levels of automation cannot coexist with low unemployment. Singapore and South Korea are at the top of the rankings for deployment of robots compared to the size of the workforce and yet they enjoy low unemployment.Nevertheless, Frey warns of rising anxiety about robots stealing jobs once the immediate fear of the coronavirus recedes.But he doubts a worldwide movement against automation will gain traction as job losses are a local phenomenon and tend to happen in regions that have long suffered from manufacturing jobs disappearing.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/steroid-first-drug-shown-to-save-lives-of-severest-covid-19-cases/,classes over new outbreak as India deaths soar,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — The steroid dexamethasone was shown Tuesday to be the first drug to significantly reduce the risk of death among severe COVID-19 cases, in trial results hailed as a “major breakthrough” in the fight against the disease.Researchers led by a team from the University of Oxford administered the widely available drug to more than 2,000 severely ill COVID-19 patients.Among those who could only breathe with the help of a ventilator, dexamethasone reduced deaths by one third, and by one-fifth in other patients receiving oxygen only, according to preliminary results.Normally used to treat a range of allergic reactions as well as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma, dexamethasone is an anti-inflammatory.Daily doses of the steroid could prevent one-in-eight ventilated patient deaths and save one out of every 25 patients requiring oxygen alone, the team said.The trial, carried out by the RECOVERY research group that is searching for effective COVID-19 treatments, included a control group of 4,000 patients who did not receive the drug.“Dexamethasone is the first drug to be shown to improve survival in COVID-19. This is an extremely welcome result,” said Peter Horby, professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford.“Dexamethasone is inexpensive, on the shelf, and can be used immediately to save lives worldwide.”Britain’s Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the country’s patients would start to receive the drug immediately.Hancock said the government had started stockpiling dexamethasone back in March after preliminary trials showed “early signs” of the drug’s potential.The trial results are particularly promising as around 40 percent of COVID-19 patients who require a ventilator end up dying, often because of the body’s uncontrolled inflammatory response to the virus.For those receiving the new treatment, the mortality rate dropped to less than 30 percent.“This is a major breakthrough: dexamethasone is the first and only drug that has made a significant difference to patient mortality for COVID-19,” said Nick Cammack, COVID-19 therapeutics accelerator lead at the Wellcome Trust health charity.“Potentially preventing one death in every eight ventilated patients would be remarkable.”The trial showed dexamethasone to be ineffective in treating patients with milder forms of COVID-19, however.A number of existing drugs have been trialled as a treatment against the novel coronavirus, with mixed results.Trials of treatment of the anti-arthritis drug hydroxychloroquine were halted in several countries after a major study in The Lancet medical journal suggested it showed no benefit among COVID-19 patients and even increased the risk of death.That study has since been retracted due to inconsistencies in the data, but others have come to the same conclusion.Remdesivir, an anti-viral that appears to reduce the length of treatment in some patients, is already being used in Britain, but one study in April showed it had “no significant clinical benefit”.The fact that an existing, cheap and largely side-effect free medication has been shown to be effective in severe COVID-19 cases is “of tremendous importance”, according to Stephen Griffin, associate professor in the School of Medicine, University of Leeds.“There is (now) realistic scope for further improving the clinical management of this devastating disease,” said Griffin, who was not involved in the study.Cammack said that in light of the study results, dexamethasone “must now be rolled out and accessed by thousands of critically ill patients around the world.”burs-pg/mh/dl© Agence France-Presse"

This is an extremely welcome result,” said Peter Horby, professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford.“Dexamethasone is inexpensive, on the shelf, and can be used immediately to save lives worldwide.”Britain’s Health Secretary Matt Hancock said patients would start to receive the drug immediately.“This is great news and I congratulate the Government of the UK, the University of Oxford, and the many hospitals and patients in the UK who have contributed to this lifesaving scientific breakthrough,” WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.More than eight million people have now been infected by the virus worldwide since it first emerged in China late last year, claiming 436,813 lives so far as the tolls still surge in Latin America and South Asia.In Europe, caseloads and death rates have broadly declined.The UK, however, is still struggling with the world’s third largest death toll and New Zealand — which had ended community transmission — said two new cases reported there were recent arrivals from Britain.European countries are eager to drop coronavirus restrictions to save the imminent summer tourist season but Spain warned that it may quarantine British visitors should the UK persist with its plan to quarantine all overseas arrivals.The latest reminder of the underlying threat came from China, which had largely brought its outbreak under control, as 27 infections were reported in Beijing, where a new cluster linked to a wholesale food market has sparked mass testing and neighbourhood lockdowns.“The epidemic situation in the capital is extremely severe,” Beijing city spokesman Xu Hejian warned, as the number of confirmed infections rose to 106.Beijing authorities urged residents to not leave the city and closed schools again as officials scrambled to contain the outbreak.In the US, the central bank chief Powell once again pledged the Fed will use all of its policy tools to help ensure recovery from the outbreak which he said has inflicted the worst pain on low-income and minority groups.Despite a surprising rebound in employment in May, the US economy has shed nearly 20 million jobs since February and the contraction of GDP in the April-June quarter “is likely to be the most severe on record,” he said.While China’s new cases have caused concern about a resurgence of the virus, the disease is also gaining momentum in other regions with massive populations.Known infections in India have crossed 330,000 and already stretched authorities are bracing for the monsoon season, which causes outbreaks of other illnesses such as dengue fever and malaria every year.Vidya Thakur, medical superintendent at Mumbai’s Rajawadi Hospital, is used to managing “heavy burdens”, she says.But COVID-19 “has left us helpless… and the monsoon will make things even more difficult.”In Latin America, countries are struggling to contain the disease while trying to ease the crushing economic blow dealt by widespread lockdowns and social distancing measures.Peru reported its economy shrank by more than 40 percent year-on-year in April, while Chile extended its state of emergency by three months.Ecuador, which has the region’s fourth highest official virus death toll after Brazil, Mexico and Peru, has extended its state of emergency for 60 more days.The United States also agreed to keep its borders with Mexico and Canada closed until July 21, extending travel restrictions for a third time because of the pandemic.After a gradual drop in new cases, European nations including Belgium, France, Germany and Greece have lifted border restrictions hoping to boost tourism and travel over the summer months.But disruptions to normal social and economic life continue.In Britain, the Premier League football season resumes on Wednesday, but in empty stadiums.There are fears some supporters will ignore social-distancing rules by congregating outside the grounds where their teams are playing, risking new clusters of infections.League chief executive Richard Masters said: “Please stay away and enjoy the matches at home. By turning up to the game you are putting things at jeopardy.”The US Open tennis championships will also go ahead as scheduled in August without spectators, officials confirmed on Tuesday.After weeks of uncertainty surrounding the tournament — which is being staged in the epicentre of the US virus crisis — New York Governor Andrew Cuomo formally agreed to allow it to go ahead.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/over-100-arrested-after-violent-disorder-at-far-right-linked-uk-protest/,Over 100 arrested after violent disorder at far-right linked UK protest,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — Police in London said they arrested more than 100 people on Saturday after far-right protesters holding a counter-demonstration against anti-racism activists clashed with officers.Thousands of people defied the coronavirus restrictions to assemble in and around Parliament Square, in the centre of the capital.That required “major” policing operation the Metropolitan Police Service said, adding that they had encountered “pockets of violence directed towards our officers”.Television footage showed some agitators throwing punches, bottles and smoke bombs at officers as well as scuffling with rival protesters.The Met they had arrested more than 100 peopled by 2000 GMT for violent disorder, assault on officers and possession of an offensive weapon. Six officers suffered minor injuries.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said “racist thuggery has no place on our streets” and that “anybody attacking the police would be met with full force of the law”.As footage of the disorder was shared widely on social media, he wrote on Twitter: “Racism has no part in the UK and we must work together to make that a reality.”A protest by the Black Lives Matter group planned for Saturday had been switched to Friday to avoid clashes with the far-right counter-demonstration.Anti-racism group Hope Not Hate had warned before Saturday that hooligan gangs attached to some English football clubs also planning to attend Saturday’s counter-protest.Paul Golding, leader of fringe far-right political group Britain First, which has seen its members jailed for hate crimes and been banned from Facebook, was among the first to arrive at Parliament Square.Golding, who was last month found guilty of an offence under the Terrorism Act, told the domestic Press Association news agency they had turned out to “guard our monuments”.Earlier, a march by several hundred Black Lives Matter activists through the capital went ahead, ending in Trafalgar Square near where the counter protesters gathered and amid a heavy police presence.Police commander, Bas Javid said a number of demonstrators had failed to disperse by 1600 GMT.“There have been pockets of violence directed towards our officers. This is completely unacceptable and I condemn those involved,” he added.Police have also launched an investigation after a photo posted on social media appeared to show a man urinating on a memorial to Keith Palmer, the police officer killed in the 2017 terror attack outside parliament.The Met would “gather all the evidence available to us and take appropriate action,” said Javid.London’s mayor Sadiq Khan praised the force for doing a “fantastic job to control the situation.“Millions of Londoners will have been disgusted by the shameful scenes of violence, desecration and racism displayed by the right-wing extremists who gathered in our city today,” he added.Britain has seen a wave of protests prompted by last month’s death during a US police arrest of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American, which triggered outrage around the world.Most of them have been peaceful, but demonstrations in London last weekend latterly turned violent, while crowds in Bristol, southwest England, toppled a statue to a 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston and threw it into the harbour.Several central London memorials were boarded up as a precaution ahead of Saturday’s demonstrations. They included one of World War II leader Winston Churchill — which last weekend was defaced with the word “racist” — and the Cenotaph war shrine.Former Conservative MP Nicholas Soames, Churchill’s grandson, denounced the “very small, extremely explosive group of people” responsible for last weekend’s vandalism.But he told the Daily Telegraph: “The idea that the hard right should stand guard over Churchill is absolutely repulsive.“It feels like a society that has lost its compass.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/china-reports-progress-in-swine-fever-vaccine-trials/,China reports progress in swine fever vaccine trials,1,"BEIJING, China (AFP) — A vaccine developed in China for African swine fever, which devastated the country’s pig herd and caused pork prices to soar, is progressing smoothly, according to results reported on Wednesday.The widespread outbreak of swine fever since August 2018 has disrupted the supply of pork in China, where it is a staple meat, with millions of animals culled.The disease wiped out about 40 percent of the country’s pig herd, causing prices to rocket as officials struggled to stabilise supplies.Authorities have since been looking into means of preventing the disease, and the vaccine strain passed a national review in December 2019, according to a report by the China Science Daily posted on the website of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS).In March, the vaccine was approved by the agriculture ministry for clinical trials in northern Heilongjiang province, central Henan province and northwest Xinjiang region.Clinical trials of the vaccine developed by the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute were seeing “smooth progress”, according to the CAAS.About 3,000 pigs are involved in the ongoing trials, launched between April and June, with the animals in “good condition”, said the report.Vaccinated sows have not shown abnormal clinical conditions or miscarriages, and the pigs have not made any toxic discharge of the vaccine.Since immunisation, the fatality rate has been under one percent, and the immunised herd has not shown significant differences to the control group.The CAAS is expected to “accelerate the development of the vaccine” in the next step."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/face-masks-health-checks-and-long-check-ins-the-future-of-flying/,Face masks,1,"SINGAPORE, Singapore (AFP) — Cabin crew in protective suits, health certifications for passengers, mandatory face masks, and longer check-in times.This is the new reality of mass air travel.As people dream of taking to the skies once more, they face the prospect that changes to curb the spread of coronavirus will be even more challenging than those brought in after the 2001 terror attacks in the United States.In addition to the strict security measures commonplace around the world since then, passengers will now encounter a barrage of checks for COVID-19.“Before the pandemic, we were told to arrive two hours before the flight. This time we had to be at the airport at least four hours before flying,” said Indonesian Suyanto after taking a domestic route in late May.There were multiple queues and screenings before he could even check in at the airport, he added.Passengers in the country must declare a reason for flying, provide documentation proving they are virus-free, undergo multiple screenings, and offer details of their movements on arrival.“It was more tiring and expensive. With these kinds of strict rules, I think people will think twice before travelling,” said the 40-year-old, who had to pay double the usual fare for his short flight as some seats were left empty for social distancing.As the aviation industry attempts to find a way forward, experts warn the impact of the pandemic will be far-reaching.“9/11 created a new environment for the entire travel industry in terms of security,” explained Shukor Yusof from Malaysia-based Endau Analytics.While the fallout from the 2001 attacks could be used as an “indicator” of what to expect, the COVID-19 challenge was a “far more serious… global event”, he said.The United Nations’ civil aviation agency has drawn up a set of guidelines for safe flying in the wake of the pandemic, from mandatory wearing of masks to the disinfection of areas people come in contact with.In addition, industry body the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has suggested governments collect passenger data — including health information — ahead of travel, and that access to airports be restricted to staff and same-day travellers.Other measures outlined in their guidelines include the redesign of gate areas to reduce congestion, faster and smoother boarding and baggage collection procedures, and even “prohibiting queues for the washrooms” to limit passenger interaction.“The COVID-19 crisis is the biggest disruption in the history of the aviation industry. The recovery is going to be long and slow,” Albert Tjoeng, regional spokesman for IATA, told AFP.Implementing new regulations is already proving challenging — and chaotic.While some US airlines require masks be worn in-flight, it has proven difficult to enforce this rule if passengers are defiant.In India, which resumed domestic flights last week, some cabin crew wore protective suits with masks, plastic visors and blue rubber gloves, but, according to media reports, had no idea if they were supposed to quarantine post-flight.Mumbai airport put in place social distancing rules but these quickly fell apart when angry travellers harangued staff after flights were cancelled last-minute.The most hotly debated measure in the industry has been whether to leave middle seats empty.Japan Airlines and Delta are among carriers doing so but Michael O’Leary, the boss of Irish low-cost airline Ryanair, has said the idea is “idiotic” and would stop his firm making money.The emergence of COVID-19, which was first reported in China last year and has since infected more than seven million people worldwide, brought air travel to an almost complete halt with entire fleets grounded and mass layoffs.IATA forecasts international carriers are in line to make a combined net loss of more than $84 billion this year.“We don’t know exactly how the trajectory of this recovery will look,” Singapore Airlines chief executive Goh Choon Phong said, after the carrier reported the first full-year loss in its 48-year history.There are some signs of recovery as major economies ease lockdowns — with IATA pointing to a growth in flight numbers from April to May — but flying looks set to struggle to return to pre-virus levels.A confusing patchwork of rules imposed by countries at different stages in tackling their outbreaks makes it tricky for consumers to plan holidays or visit family abroad.Some nations are maintaining bans on travellers from hard-hit nations or requiring people to enter quarantine on arrival, typically for a 14-day period.Countries that have kept the virus in check are looking at creating “travel bubbles”, or reciprocal agreements with other places on similar outbreak curves, but these can have onerous requirements.A “fast lane” for essential business and official travel between some parts of China and Singapore has been launched, but travellers need sponsorship and have to take a virus test before departure and on arrival.Many who previously flew frequently may simply choose not to for the time being.Fazal Bahardeen, chief executive of Singapore-based Islamic travel specialist HalalTrip, told AFP: “If I have to go through all the hassle, I might as well not travel unless I really have to.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-backs-masks-where-virus-widespread-distancing-tough/,health checks and long check-ins: the future of flying,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization on Friday backed the use of fabric facemasks in places where the new coronavirus is widespread and physical distancing is difficult, in a change of advice.As the deadly virus continues to spread, the WHO issued updated guidance on who should wear a mask, when it should be worn and what it should be made of.The use of masks has been a hot topic ever since the pandemic first emerged in China in December.But the UN health agency stressed that facemasks alone “will not protect you from COVID-19” — and people suffering with the virus should not be out in public if they can possibly avoid it.“In light of evolving evidence, WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult — such as on public transport, in shops, or in other confined or crowded environments,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.In areas with community-level virus transmission, “we advise that people aged 60 years or over, or those with underlying conditions, should wear a medical mask in situations where physical distancing is not possible”, he added.The WHO maintained its recommendation that people who are sick with COVID-19 symptoms should stay at home and if it is absolutely necessary for them or their contacts to leave home, they should wear a medical mask.As before, those caring for an infected person at home should wear a medical mask when in the same room; and health workers should wear medical masks plus protective equipment when dealing with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.But in an update affecting healthcare workers, the WHO now recommends that in areas with widespread virus transmission, all people working in clinical areas of a health facility should wear medical masks — not just those dealing with patients with COVID-19. The WHO also issued new guidance on the composition of non-medical fabric masks for the general public, advising that they should consist of at least three layers of different material.The inner layer should be water-absorbent, such as cotton; the middle layer should be from a material like non-woven polypropylene, and acts as a filter; while the outer layer should be water-resistant, such as polyester.The WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan stressed that putting on a fabric mask is primarily about preventing the wearer from possibly infecting others, rather than self-protection.“It’s an altruistic act,” he said.And Tedros stressed that masks were only one part of an effective strategy to suppress the virus — and should not lure people into a false sense of security.He said they were not a replacement for physical distancing and hand hygiene.“Masks alone will not protect you from COVID-19,” he told a virtual news conference.“Find, isolate, test and care for every case, and to trace and quarantine every contact. That is what we know works. That is every country’s best defence against COVID-19.”The novel coronavirus has infected at least 6.6 million people and killed more than 390,000 since the outbreak first emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pygmies-return-to-forest-to-isolate-against-coronavirus/,WHO backs masks where virus widespread,1,", Dzanga-Sangha, a wildlife sanctuary in southwest Central African Republic, is a remote place, linked to the rest of the world by a narrow trail that becomes impassable in heavy rain.But for the region’s Pygmies—outcasts in a country already ranked among the poorest in the world—Dzanga-Sangha’s isolation could be a blessing.As coronavirus spreads in the CAR, with more than 1,000 cases officially recorded and four deaths, a campaign has been launched to encourage the Bayaka people, who divide their time between the village and the forest, to hole up in the reserve.“They are being asked to go and live in their hunting camps for three months,” said Luis Arranz, in charge of the national park for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).“Every week, we’re going to drop off cassava and medicines. They have to stay isolated. It’s our only solution,” he said.In nearby towns, mayors, priests and police have all been urged to support the scheme, which urges Pygmies to stay away from urban centres to avoid catching the virus.“Once in the forest, the Pygmies will still come to sell their products, but using a community relay in order to avoid direct contact. The idea is that they don’t come to market,” said Yvon Martial Amolet, a local lawyer and representative of the NGO House for Pygmy Children and Women based in the nearby town Bayanga.Pygmies are considered especially at risk from novel diseases because of their poor overall health, their poverty—the vast majority are too poor to afford a doctor—and their lifestyle.“The infant mortality rate is very high among the Bayaka. Those who survive are likely to be more resistant to a virus, but we have no data about any vulnerability or natural immunity to imported diseases,” said Emilia Bylicka, a doctor who spent four years caring for Pygmies in the CAR’s southwest.The Pygmies’ collective, semi-nomadic lifestyle could accelerate viral spread, Amolet said.“People continue to share cigarettes and coffee and there are five or 10 people per hut,” he said.The life expectancy of Bayaka Pygmies is around 35 years for men and 38 years for women — less than half of that in the industrialised world.As an incentive to keep them away, park authorities have provided rations higher than the value of their average salary when they work for the villagers.But the Pygmies have not all been easy to convince, especially those who have taken to life outside the forest, and the sanctuary itself presents its own dangers.The dense reserve, a UNESCO-World Heritage site and the last sanctuary for animal life in a poor country ravaged by civil war, offers one of the world’s few refuges for species facing extinction.Illegal hunting could intensify as the epidemic worsens and resources to protect the reserve become more limited, according to Arranz, who is responsible for preserving the forest’s biodiversity.The Pygmies live under constant threat from armed hunters.“Some poachers may commit violence against them,” said Amolet.Some fear a backlash from the ethnic Bantu population—known locally as Bilo—who subject the Pygmies to what often appears to be modern slavery.“At first,” Amolet explained, “they (the Pygmies) used to say that coronavirus was a white man’s disease. Then they said the disease had come to punish the Bilo.”In the villages around Bayanga, the mud houses along the road belong to the Bantu, while the Pygmies often occupy tiny branch huts in the backyards of their employers.“The Bilos give a bit of salt or a cigarette for a day’s work in the fields or in the bush,” said a Bayaka chief who did not want to be named.Violence and sexual assaults are commonplace.“All Bayaka have these problems,” said an elder.As the Pygmies have been encouraged to isolate, Bilos have discouraged them from going, desperate to keep them working.“They told the Bayaka that if we took them to the forest, we were going to kill them,” said Amolet.“They’re people who live off the Pygmy communities and if you take them (the Pygmies) away, life becomes difficult for them,” he added.Some Bayaka Pygmies, already confined amid the trees, see coronavirus as a genuine threat, but a distant one.“The spirits of the forest protect us,” joked Marc, a white-bearded Pygmy, astonished that the visitor refused to give him a handshake—the universal greeting that in these times has become risky.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/russia-struggles-to-clean-up-arctic-river-fuel-spill/,distancing tough,1,"MOSCOW, Russia (AFP) — Russia on Thursday intensified efforts to clean up a major fuel spill that environmentalists say is the worst such accident in the Arctic, as investigators made their first arrest.A diesel reservoir collapsed at a power station outside the northern Siberian city of Norilsk on Friday, releasing 15,000 tonnes of fuel into a river and 6,000 tonnes into the soil, according to Russia’s state environmental watchdog.President Vladimir Putin has ordered a state of emergency to deal with the disaster.On Wednesday he furiously criticised the delay in the cleanup response, while Norilsk Nickel, the metals giant that owns the collapsed fuel reservoir through a subsidiary, insists it notified the proper agencies immediately.Greenpeace Russia said the accident was the “first accident of such a scale in the Arctic” and comparable to the Exxon Valdez disaster off the coast of Alaska in 1989.Russia’s Investigative Committee said a power station supervisor has been detained and will be charged shortly as it conducts three probes into environmental pollution and safety violations.No information was given about the possible charges against the employee.Reinforcements arrived at the remote location on Thursday, said Andrei Malov, spokesman for Russia’s Marine Rescue Service, which cleans up marine spills and was called in at the weekend.“There haven’t been such spills in the Arctic before,” he told AFP. “It needs to be collected very quickly because the fuel is dissolving in the water.”The Ambarnaya River, which is affected by the spill, feeds into Lake Pyasino, a major body of water and the source of the Pyasina River that is vitally important to the entire Taimyr peninsula.Russian fisheries agency spokesman Dmitry Klokov said restoring the polluted water system would take “decades”.“The scope of this catastrophe is being underestimated,” he told TASS news agency, adding that most of the fuel had sunk to the bottom of the river and already reached the lake.Malov said the marine rescue service has put up six oil containment booms in the Ambarnaya River to stop the diesel fuel going into the lake and was using special devices to skim off the fuel.But the clean-up mission is being hampered by the lack of roads in the area and windy weather that has already caused blocks of ice to breach the barriers, releasing more fuel towards the lake, and forcing responders to reposition them, Malov said.“It’s swampy territory, and everything can only be delivered there on all-terrain vehicles,” Malov said, predicting that the collected fuel will have to stay on site until the winter in special tanks.Prosecutors in Krasnoyarsk region said in a statement that the spill also polluted 180,000 square metres of land before hitting the river.Norilsk Nickel said the accident possibly occurred because the ground under the fuel reservoir subsided as the permafrost melted due to climate change.WWF expert Alexei Knizhnikov said that while climate change does affect permafrost, the accident wouldn’t have happened if the company followed the rules.By Russian law, there should be a containment structure around any fuel reservoir that would have kept most of the spillage on site, he said.“A lot of the blame lies with the company,” he added.The difficult terrain prompted some officials to suggest the collected fuel should be burned off at the scene, but Russia’s environmental watchdog chief Svetlana Radionova on Thursday ruled this out.“There will not be any burning of the petroleum products,” she was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying, also promising to consult with the scientific community on the best course of action.ma/am/txw© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/virus-patients-with-high-blood-pressure-twice-as-likely-to-die-study/,Pygmies return to forest to isolate against coronavirus,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Patients with high blood pressure admitted to hospital with coronavirus infections are twice as likely to die as those without the condition, researchers said on Friday.For in-patients with the virus who had stopped taking medication for high blood pressure, the risk of dying doubled again, they reported in the European Heart Journal.“It is important that patients with high blood pressure realize that they are at increased risk of dying from COVID-19,” said senior author Fei Li, a cardiologist at Xijing Hospital in Xian, China.For the study, researchers in China and Ireland retroactively examined cases admitted to Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan between February 5 and March 15.Nearly 30 percent — 850 patients — had a history of hypertension, another term for high blood pressure.Four percent of those patients died, compared with just over one percent of the 2,027 patients without hypertension.After adjusting for age, sex and other medical conditions, the researchers calculated that having high blood pressure increased the risk of dying two-fold.In a separate meta-analysis of three other studies covering 2,300 COVID-19 patients from the same hospital, the researchers investigated the impact of different blood pressure drugs on death rates.Contrary to their expectations, they found that a class of drugs known as RAAS inhibitors — which include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) — were not linked to higher COVID-19 mortality.Indeed, the risk appeared to be somewhat diminished.“We suggest that patients should not discontinue or change their usual anti-hypertensive treatment unless instructed by a physician,” said co-author Ling Tao, a professor at Xijing Hospital.The authors noted that their study was observational and not based on clinical trials, meaning further research was needed before they could make firm clinical recommendations.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/weak-demand-pushing-oil-gas-toward-terminal-decline-report/,Virus patients with high blood pressure twice as likely to die: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Falling fossil fuel demand coupled with mounting risk for investors could slash the value of oil, gas and coal reserves by two thirds, sending shock waves through the global economy, energy analysts warned Thursday.The value of projected profits for the sector could also fall by two thirds, , a non-profit financial think tank focused on aligning capital markets with climate policy.Competition from clean technologies along with government policies to achieve climate targets and energy security are pushing the fossil fuel industry toward “terminal decline”, the study concluded.“Terminal decline starts when demand peaks,” lead author Kingsmill Bond, Carbon Tracker’s new energy strategist, told AFP.“Global coal demand, for example, peaked in 2013 and has never recovered to that level.”Before the coronavirus outbreak, many analysts predicted global demand for oil and gas would peak in the mid-2020s, while the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast a plateau towards the end of the decade for oil.But the economic meltdown triggered by pandemic lockdowns across the world starting in March could accelerate that process.“We may now have seen peak fossil fuel demand as a whole,” said Bond, who worked for 25 years in equity research. “When a cyclical shock hits a sector already facing structural decline, it brings forward the peak in demand.”The IEA foresees an eight percent drop in fossil fuel demand in 2020 due to the pandemic.“Nobody knows how much the recovery will be in 2021,” said Bond. “But if the recovery is half, and if the fossil fuel industry returns to a growth rate of one percent, it will take until 2025 to get back to 2019 levels.”“By then, renewable energy technologies will be large enough to supply all the growth in energy demand.”In 2019, renewable power — mainly solar and wind — already accounted for 72 percent of all expansion in the electricity sector, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reported last month.When a challenger technology takes all the growth, the incumbent — by definition — enters into terminal decline, experience in other sectors has shown. That threshold is typically crossed when the challenger has five percent of market share.Renewables already account for about a quarter of electricity generation, but — not counting hydro, which has less potential for expansion — only about four percent of global primary energy consumption.“Now is the time to plan an orderly wind-down of fossil fuel assets and manage the impact of the global economy rather than try to sustain the unsustainable,” Bond said.Shell’s first dividend cut since World War II, Repsol’s write-off of nearly five billion euros ($5.6 billion) last year, and a wave of bankruptcies in the US shale oil sector all point to possible structural change.And yet oil and gas companies are forecasting growth in demand for their products. Indeed, the fossil fuel system as a whole has been investing about $5 trillion annually on new supply and demand infrastructure for several years running.The size of the fossil fuel economy — about $10 trillion in supply infrastructure, and $22 trillion in demand infrastructure — means its rapid decline could pose a threat to financial stability, the report concluded.“Companies across the fossil fuel system are worth $18 trillion in listed equity, making up a quarter of the total value of global equity markets,” it said.In 2018, the World Bank valued future profits from oil, gas and coal — cast over a roughly 50-year period — at $39 trillion.Carbon Tracker calculated that if demand falls by two percent a year — in line with the Paris Agreement goal of capping global warming below two degrees Celsius — those future profits would collapse by nearly two-thirds to $14 trillion.Producers projecting a return to business-as-usual, by contrast, are banking on profits in excess of $100 trillion, the report found.A collapse of future profits would be especially threatening to petro-states whose economies rely on oil export income. The world’s biggest oil and gas earners are Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq and Iran.Those most vulnerable to instability include Venezuela, Ecuador, Libya, Algeria, Nigeria and Angola, the report said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/hydroxychloroquine-ineffective-at-preventing-covid-19-trial/,Roche wins US clearance for virus treatment test,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Taking hydroxychloroquine shortly after being exposed to COVID-19 does not help prevent infection in a statistically meaningful way, scientists reported Wednesday following a clinical trial.The medicine has been touted by US President Donald Trump, who has said he used it as a prophylaxis against the novel coronavirus.But an experiment involving 821 people across the United States and Canada showed it did not work significantly better than a placebo for this purpose.The study was led by a team at the University of Minnesota, and their paper was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.Researchers enrolled adults who had come into contact with someone who had a confirmed case of COVID-19 for more than 10 minutes at a distance of six feet (about two meters) or less.The majority of them — 719 — were deemed to have had “high-risk” exposure because they wore neither a face mask nor an eye shield at the time, while the rest were “moderate-risk” because they covered their face but did not have goggles.All participants were randomly assigned to receive either hydroxychloroquine — which is certified for use against malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus — or a placebo, within four days.The researchers then looked at how many patients went on to develop COVID-19 over the next two weeks, which was confirmed either by a laboratory test or by clinical signs.They found that 49 of the 414 given the medicine got the disease caused by the coronavirus, compared to 58 of the 407 on the placebo.This translates to 11.83 percent on the drug were infected, versus 14.25 percent on the placebo.The absolute difference of about 2.4 percentage points in favor of the medicine was not considered statistically significant given the sample size, meaning it could have occurred because of chance.Side effects were more common with hydroxychloroquine than with the placebo — 40.1 percent versus 16.8 percent — but no serious adverse reactions were reported.“This randomized trial did not demonstrate a significant benefit of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for COVID-19,” wrote the authors.The results of the study were eagerly awaited because it was a randomized controlled trial (RCT), a carefully designed experiment that is considered the gold standard for investigating clinical outcomes.Several previous studies on the drug that have made headlines were “observational,” meaning they looked back at what had already happened. As such, more variables are left to chance and it is generally harder to draw firm conclusions.Nevertheless, Martin Landray, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Oxford, said more research was needed to know for sure whether hydroxychloroquine might have a moderately positive effect.“The study is too small to be definitive,” said Landray, who was not involved in the trial.The results “makes it very unlikely that there is a large effect (e.g. a halving in the risk of infection) but cannot rule out a more modest difference (e.g. a reduction of one-quarter or one-third) which would still be very valuable,” he added.© Agence France-Presse"

But as COVID came along, the need for the solution really accelerated,” Walker said.The trial is a milestone for unmanned aviation in the UK, as under current regulations drones must always be flown within visual line of sight of the remote pilot.Walker and his drone team are feeding data and reports collected from the flights to the Civil Aviation Authority after each day of flying.If successful, the service will cut delivery times from up to six hours, by ground transport and ferry, to around 15 minutes.It is hoped that the project will open the way for urgent medicine to be delivered to islands and remote locations across the UK.“We can transport anything really up to about five kilogrammes,” Walker says.“We can do it under cold storage conditions. It is temperature controlled the whole way there and back.”Stephen Whiston, who has been overseeing the project for the NHS, called it “a groundbreaking piece of work in the UK” that could also open the way for drone deliveries in urban areas.“There have been lots of trials obviously, commercially, but this is about looking at how they can support NHS delivery, not only in remote isolated areas but potentially into the urban areas where you have congestion and delays in traffic, where you might need to transport stuff,” he added.On the field, a faint buzzing sound in the distance heralded the arrival of a vehicle making the return leg of the journey, having delivered its dummy load.“Drone in sight,” shouted an operator, as the craft appeared above the hill.The drone, described by one observer as sounding like a nest of angry hornets, hovered above before steadily descending and touching down on the grass.After the engines powered down, applause and cheers from the drone pilots broke the silence, with Walker heaving a sigh of relief.The trial is due to run until June 5.© Agence France-Presse"

Well, look, here he is,” she says, smiling tenderly as Joseph reaches out weakly, his eyes shining as Valco tries in vain to climb onto his master’s lap on the other side of the sheet.The new coronavirus has proved deadliest for older people, and France imposed a strict no-visit policy at retirement homes when the country was placed in lockdown in March in a bid to curb infections.So far, the virus has killed 10,336 people at French care homes, authorities say, more than a third of the national toll of 28,596.But the lack of contact has been hard to bear for nursing home residents, many of whom are battling dementia, and psychologists have warned that the trauma of perceived abandonment can be fatal for some.Confined to their rooms, “the residents suffer tremendously” and some “just let themselves die, they stop eating, they no longer find meaning in life,” said Audrey Bernard, director of the Bourbourg nursing home.The separation has been hard on loved ones too.“We couldn’t visit him for two months… This week I called for an appointment, and voila, the surprise!” Nathalie Szczepaniak said, pointing to the plastic reception tent she discovered upon arrival.She had been expecting to see her husband only from a distance, but instead the igloo-like contraption allowed them to experience something as close as possible to real contact.“We can touch each other, you can feel the body heat through the (plastic)… It is very, very, very nice,” Szczepaniak said, a big smile on her face.Erected just last week, —, connected to an entrance on either side that can be closed airtight.“You can see an improvement in the people who’ve already had visits… there is renewed energy, a newfound interest, you can see the smiles on the faces both of the families and the residents,” Bernard told AFP of the innovation.“The families really feel like they’re with the resident, there’s no feeling of separation, it allows them to touch each other safely… They are both inside, safe and secure, they can hear each other easily, as if they were in the same room.”Before the bubble, the home had tried to facilitate family access by placing residents in the on-site restaurant, with visitors waving and talking to them through the windows, from outside.But they had trouble hearing each other, and many found the experience frustrating.“Today, with this bubble… they can talk, see each other without masks and almost touch,” said Bernard, who recounts seeing one couple kiss through the plastic.“It is excellent. Excellent!” exclaims Nathalie. “He did not even notice the plastic. And I saw him smile, something that I haven’t been seeing any more.”After she leaves, the bubble is disinfected before the next visitors to arrive: a woman coming to see her father, his granddaughter in tow.The bubble tent receives between six and eight visits a day, each lasting 30 to 45 minutes, and there is already a long waiting list.“We wanted to restore a humane dimension to a totally inhumane situation while guaranteeing safety, the non-transmission” of the virus, said Pierre-Stephane Dumas, of BubbleTree, the company that designed the tent.A prototype was erected at the Bourbourg site without cost for a two-week trial period, with a view to making improvements before others are rolled out to more French care homes.Several have already shown interest, Dumas said, but the wind and rain-resistant installation, complete with electricity, costs between 7,500 and 10,000 euros ($8,250-$11,000) to manufacture, meaning financing will have to be found to reduce overheads.© Agence France-Presse"

Nearly a quarter of patients had been discharged home by this point.The study confirmed that insulin and other treatments modifying blood sugar were not a risk factor for severe forms of COVID-19, and should be continued for persons with diabetes.Other significant risk factors included heart disease, high blood pressure, and a history of lung disease.The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide is approaching six million, with the actual number thought to be an order of magnitude higher.More than 354,000 deaths have been registered.In a grim signal to other countries hoping to exit lockdown, South Korea reimposed social distancing rules this week after a spike in new cases.© Agence France-Presse"

Last year dozens of people died.Met officials said Churu in the northern state of Rajasthan was the hottest place on record on Tuesday, at 50 Celsius, while parts of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh sweltered in the high 40s.Parts of the capital, New Delhi, recorded the hottest May day in 18 years with the mercury hitting 47.6 Celsius.No deaths have been reported so far this year, but last year the government said the heat had killed 3,500 people since 2015. There have been fewer fatalities in recent years.The country of 1.3 billion people suffers from severe water shortages with tens of millions lacking running water — to say nothing of air conditioning.Parts of Delhi and elsewhere regularly see scuffles when tankers arrive to deliver water. Last year Chennai made international headlines when the southern city ran out of water entirely.The heatwave adds to problems the country already has dealing with the spread of coronavirus.India now has the 10th highest number of coronavirus cases globally, climbing above 150,000 on Wednesday with almost 4,500 deaths.Last week cyclone Amphan killed more than 100 people as it ravaged in eastern India and Bangladesh, flattening villages, destroying farms and leaving millions without power.Huge swarms of desert locusts, meanwhile, have destroyed nearly 50,000 hectares (125,000 acres) of crops across western and central India, and may enter Delhi in coming days.The north-eastern states of Assam and Meghalaya are also currently experiencing floods, with more heavy rainfall forecast in the coming days.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/bushfire-hit-australians-still-in-tents-as-virus-slows-recovery/,Bushfire-hit Australians still in tents as virus slows recovery,1,"COBARGO, Australia (AFP) — Victims of Australia’s catastrophic bushfires are still living in tents, garages and makeshift shelters months after the blazes ended, with efforts to rebuild their lives hampered by the coronavirus pandemic.Inside a small tin shed on Australia’s southeast coast, a family of six takes refuge from the cold as the southern hemisphere winter begins to bite.The structure — chock-full of toys and beds — has been home to 51-year-old Anita Lawrence and five of her children since February.She had been in Tasmania when fires ripped through the area, torching materials ready to build a new home and new life for her family.“Every single little thing disappeared,” she told AFP near trees still blackened from the blazes.Australia’s unprecedented bushfire crisis that scorched an area larger than most nations and displaced thousands put a rare spotlight on climate change in a rich, developed country.The disaster sparked charity telethons, government promises of a quick recovery and donations from across the world.But six months on and just six hours drive from hyper-affluent Sydney, scores of people like Lawrence are still living in limbo.“When you come back, and there’s so much destruction, everything is difficult,” she said.Before the crisis Lawrence had got by working a few days a week at the local school, teaching the kids gardening.During the months-long lockdown she survived on pension savings and struggled to homeschool her own children using a single computer connected to a mobile-phone hotspot.Now schools are going back and some help has arrived, in the form of local man David Crooke and his crew who have put together an extension for their dwelling.It is temporary, but Lawrence now has a bathroom, heating and a bedroom until she can find a way to build a permanent home.“Just to see a young boy see running water even, and a shower for the first time, that’s a big thing,” said Crooke.His small team — hired by private donors — has been building shelters for those who would otherwise be destitute for months.“There’s places that are completely wiped out — our next job we go to, the ladies have a little tent in a shipping container right now,” Crooke said.He himself lost his home to the fires last year and spent the summer battling blazes.Armed with four homemade water pumps, his team saved several homes as fires repeatedly hit the southern coast of New South Wales.Since then he has been camping out in increasingly harsh conditions — moving from property to property, and helping build shelters.But with ageing equipment and a struggle to find materials, the physical and emotional toll was “flogging” the team, he said.“None of my crew have got really anything, you know, we’re week-to-week sort of guys, you rely on that paycheque big time.”Throughout the area, signs of life are springing from the charred-out landscape, but 66-year-old Wayne Keft said the recovery has been “slow and difficult” for many.His home near Cobargo was destroyed when “a fireball went through the front of the house”.He now lives in a garage, and is plagued by dust that blows in off a road nearby.A surveyor’s stake for work on his new home sits in a barrel nearby, useless until the ruins of the old structure are cleared by crews who have been operating for months on similar jobs in the area.Help has slowed since global attention shifted from bushfires to the pandemic.Mathew Hatcher said his warehouse in nearby Batemans Bay was once full of donated goods.“We were churning along, a very well-oiled machine, then COVID hit, and it kind of stopped the donations,” said Hatcher, coordinator of South Coast Donations Logistics Team.The virus had also meant many larger organisations had to pull out volunteers, leaving locals struggling through trauma without appropriate mental health support, he said.With tourism effectively banned in the state until at least June 1, the area’s primary source of income and path to recovery has also been cut off.Without a wage, it is almost impossible for local businesses to get a loan that would finance rebuilding.“This area is going to struggle financially for the long term,” Hatcher said.After the fires, Lorena Granados and her husband set up an ad-hoc market stall in front of the ashes of their shop, “Roman Leather Goods and Repairs”.They have since moved to a temporary building, hoping the business can help them get back on their feet.“We really weren’t prepared to lose our home and business in one day,” she said.The virus has slowed their trade to a trickle, but they are determined to fight on.“It encourages us to keep going every day when we sell just one little item,” she said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/italys-nearly-deserted-pompeii-reopens-its-ruins-to-public/,Italy’s nearly deserted Pompeii reopens its ruins to public,1,", (AFP) — Italy’s world-famous archaeological site Pompeii reopened to the public on Tuesday as the country’s coronavirus lockdown lifted — though guides outnumbered tourists at the ancient Roman city.The exceptionally-preserved remains of the city covered in volcanic ash by the eruption of nearby Mount Vesuvius nearly 2,000 years ago in 79 A.D. are usually the country’s second-most visited site after the Colosseum in Rome.But on Tuesday, many of its most important ruins, like its stone Amphitheatre or Temple of Apollo, lay hauntingly empty.With foreign tourists still prohibited from travel to Italy until June, the site that attracted just under four million visitors in 2019 is hoping that for now, Italian tourists can make up at least a fraction of the difference.One, Antonio DiGiuseppe, said he came every year to visit the ruins.He that being at Pompeii without crowds is “strange”.“It’s great as a tourist because you can take photos easily.”Visitors will take a mandatory route, but a second itinerary will be added on June 9. Tickets cost five euros ($5.5), but people will have to reserve ahead and have their temperatures checked by a thermal scanner on entering.Among the first through the gates Tuesday was an American couple from Detroit who had tried to visit just before the lockdown but found it closed. They have been staying in an Airbnb in Pompeii ever since.“It’s been a long wait, but this is why we came here and here we are!” Marvin Hewson said, adding that they had spent a lot of time studying the ruins from the outside.“It’s fantastic, well worth the wait to see them up close,” said his wife, Colleen.Not all were as chipper. Valentina Raffone, 48, who has been a guide at the site for some 20 years, said there was a “sense of emptiness, of sadness, of post-eruption.”“It’s only us guides, and journalists,” she said, referring to the few dozen guides who had shown up to see how the site had changed in the post-coronavirus era.Areas with only one way to enter and exit are now closed off, to avoid crowding, while those with more space — even some which were previously closed to the public — are now open.Pompeii had just celebrated the culmination of a long $113 million restoration when the coronavirus crisis hit Italy and museums and cultural sites were closed in March.The project, which began in 2012, was paid for largely by European Union funding and enlisted large teams of archaeologists, architects, engineers, geologists and anthropologists.The collapse of the “House of the Gladiators” after days of heavy rain in 2010 underscored the risk to Pompeii’s treasures after years of neglect and mismanagement.UNESCO warned that multiple buildings at the site were at risk and extensive restorations, and consistent upkeep, were needed.New treasures seen by few tourists before the lockdown included the ancient frescoes and centuries-old tile floors of the “House of Lovers,” a two-story home that had been closed to the public since 1980 after an earthquake, and the “House of Orchards,” featuring intricately detailed frescoes of fruit trees and birds.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-suspends-trials-of-hydroxychloroquine-as-virus-treatment/,study finds,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization said on Monday it had temporarily suspended clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for coronavirus.The decision came after a study published in The Lancet medical journal last week suggested the drug could increase the risk of death among COVID-19 patients, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual press conference.Tedros said the executive group of the so-called Solidarity Trial, in which hundreds of hospitals across the world have enrolled patients to test several possible treatments for the novel coronavirus, had suspended trials using that drug as a precaution.“The Executive Group has implemented a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm within the Solidarity Trial while the safety data is reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board,” Tedros said.“The other arms of the trial are continuing.”Hydroxychloroquine is normally used to treat arthritis but public figures including US President Donald Trump have backed the drug as a virus treatment, prompting governments to bulk buy.Trump said last week he was taking the drug as a preventative measure, but in an interview aired on Sunday on Sinclair Broadcasting he said he had completed his course.“Finished, just finished,” Trump said. “And by the way, I’m still here. To the best of my knowledge, here I am.”Brazil’s health minister also recommended last week using hydroxychloroquine, as well as the anti-malarial chloroquine, to treat even mild COVID-19 cases.The Lancet study found that both drugs could produce potentially serious side effects, particularly heart arrhythmia.And neither drug helped patients hospitalised with COVID-19, according to the study, which looked at the records of 96,000 patients across hundreds of hospitals.Tedros said both drugs were generally safe for patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria.WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told Monday’s briefing the Solidarity Trial had been looking only at the effects of hydroxychloroquine and not chloroquine.The decision to suspend enrolment for trials using hydroxychloroquine was “a temporary measure”, she said.– The COVID-19 pandemic, which began late last year in China, has killed nearly 350,000 people worldwide and infected almost 5.5 million, according to an AFP tally using official sources.While there is still no approved treatment or vaccine, drastic measures that at one point saw half of humanity under lockdown have pushed down transmission rates in several countries.As many nations begin to gradually lift restrictions, the WHO stressed the need to maintain physical distancing and to scale up efforts to test and detect cases.“All countries need to remain on high alert,” WHO expert Maria Van Kerkhove said.“The virus will take the opportunity to amplify if it can.”WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan warned against the idea that the pandemic might move in seasonal waves.“Making an assumption that it is on a downward trajectory, and the next danger point is some time in October or November, I think that would be a dangerous assumption,” he said."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/japan-newborn-gets-liver-stem-cells-in-world-first/,ICRC warns of dire humanitarian crisis in northeast Syria,1,"TOKYO, Japan (AFP) — Doctors in Japan have successfully transplanted liver cells derived from embryonic stem cells into a newborn baby, in a world first that could provide new treatment options for infants.The newborn was suffering from urea cycle disorder, where the liver is not capable of breaking down toxic ammonia.But the six-day-old was too small to undergo a liver transplant, generally not considered safe until a child weighs around six kilogrammes (13 pounds) at around three to five months old.Doctors at the National Center for Child Health and Development decided to try a “bridge treatment” until the baby was big enough, injecting 190 million liver cells derived from embryonic stem cells (ES cells) into the blood vessels of the baby’s liver.Following the treatment, “the patient did not see an increase in blood ammonia concentration and was able to successfully complete the next treatment”, namely a liver transplant, the institute said in a press release.The baby, whose sex has not been disclosed, received a liver transplant from its father and was discharged from the hospital six months after birth.“The success of this trial demonstrates safety in the world’s first clinical trial using human ES cells for patients with liver disease,” the institute said.It noted that in Europe and the United States, liver cells are often available after being removed from brain-dead donors, but the supply in Japan is more limited.That has created difficulties in managing the health of small children as they wait to grow big enough for liver transplants.ES cells are harvested from fertilised eggs and using them in research has raised ethical issues because embryos are destroyed subsequently.The national institute is one of two organisations in Japan allowed to establish ES cells to study new medical treatments.It works with fertilised eggs whose use has been approved by both donors having already completed fertility treatment, according to the institute.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/we-can-get-it-done-here-africas-tech-scene-tackles-virus/,Japan newborn gets liver stem cells in world first,1,", (AFP)— By the time the virus hit Africa, where cases have risen relatively slowly, images of overwhelmed hospitals and stories of health workers strapped for protective gear had been streaming in for weeks.Mehul Shah from Ultra Red Technologies, a 3D printing company in Nairobi, said he and his partner Neeval Shah quickly realised they could be “first responders” in producing locally-made equipment.In only three days they put together a working design for 3D-printed face shields made up of a visor that clips onto a plastic sheet. They currently produce around 500 a day.“It’s very important that we can show Kenyans that we can do this here and we don’t need to rely on importation. We have got the innovative know-how and the means to get this done here,” he told AFP.The team is also helping produce components that would allow ventilators to be used on more than one patient, as well as printing parts for locally-made ventilators.While Kenya only has 912 cases and 50 deaths after a little over two months, “we are preparing for the worst case scenario,” Mehul said.He said it was “a first” to see manufacturers in Kenya and even worldwide collaborating so much.“All the companies are looking at how they can use their resources to help out. All the competitors who would be fighting against each other are all coming together.”In Benin, the start-up Blolab — a digital fabrication laboratory – has also been printing 3D face shields.Developers in Kenya’s thriving tech scene are among several on the continent working on contact tracing apps.FabLab, an innovation hub in western Kisumu has developed an application called Msafari (Safari means journey in Swahili) which can track passengers on public transport.With it, passengers entering a minibus taxi — known as a matatu — can input a simple code on their phone along with the vehicle registration number.“If one of those passengers tested positive we are now able to trace all the contacts who checked in on that particular vehicle, ” said Tairus Ooyi, the lead app developer and data scientist at FabLab.Another busy area of innovation has been the production of ventilators, which have been in short supply even in rich countries as COVID-19 patients needing oxygen have swamped hospitals.Most African countries have only a handful of the machines and 10 have none at all, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.In Kenya, engineering students in collaboration with the medical department at the Kenyatta University, produced a low-cost ventilator at a tenth of the price of an imported machine — estimated at $10,000.Doctor Gordon Ogweno, a medical professor at the university said Kenya had about 50 working ventilators for a population of more than 50 million.“We are making machines with locally available material … pandemics can come and go but other conditions also require critical care,” he said.The ventilator is undergoing clinical trials.In Ghana, the Academic City College in Accra and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi managed to produce a ventilator costing between $500 and $1,000 which takes only an hour to assemble.A group of Rwandan biomedical scientists at the Integrated Polytechnic Regional College in Kigali have also been testing a locally made prototype ventilator.Meanwhile in Somalia, which has limited capacity to respond to its growing caseload, 21-year-old Mohamed Adawe has invented an automated resuscitator.While doctors normally need to pump oxygen via an Ambu bag valve mask by hand on patients struggling to breathe, Adawe’s contraption — made up of a wooden box, pipes and an electric system — pushes oxygen from an air tank into a mask placed over the patient’s mouth.“I saw people having difficulties in breathing and many have died because they could not get a machine to help them provide vital oxygen,” said Adawe, who is studying public health.Aside from locally-made items — African countries are also employing other technology to tackle the virus.Rwanda last week began using four humanoid robots in coronavirus treatment centres to minimise human to human contact. They can screen temperatures and monitor the status of patients.In Ghana, the US-based company Zipline which uses drones to ferry medicines, blood and vaccines to avoid poor roads, has begun to transport coronavirus tests.“The government told us that their biggest challenge is that the virus has spread out of the cities, they have suspected cases popping up in the rural areas and the logistics from the rural areas to the cities are very difficult,” said Zipline CEO in Ghana, Daniel Marfo.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/scientists-in-china-believe-new-drug-can-stop-pandemic-without-vaccine/,‘We can get it done here’: Africa’s tech scene tackles virus,1,"BEIJING, China (AFP) — A Chinese laboratory has been developing a drug it believes has the power to bring the coronavirus pandemic to a halt.The outbreak first emerged in China late last year before spreading across the world, prompting an international race to find treatments and vaccines.A drug being tested by scientists at China’s prestigious Peking University could not only shorten the recovery time for those infected, but even offer short-term immunity from the virus, researchers say.Sunney Xie, director of the university’s Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, told AFP that the drug has been successful at the animal testing stage.“When we injected neutralising antibodies into infected mice, after five days the viral load was reduced by a factor of 2,500,” said Xie.“That means this potential drug has (a) therapeutic effect.”The drug uses neutralising antibodies — produced by the human immune system to prevent the virus infecting cells — which Xie’s team isolated from the blood of 60 recovered patients.A study on the team’s research, published Sunday in the scientific journal Cell, suggests that using the antibodies provides a potential “cure” for the disease and shortens recovery time.Xie said his team had been working “day and night” searching for the antibody.“Our expertise is single-cell genomics rather than immunology or virology. When we realised that the single-cell genomic approach can effectively find the neutralising antibody we were thrilled.”He added that the drug should be ready for use later this year and in time for any potential winter outbreak of the virus, which has infected 4.8 million people around the world and killed more than 315,000.“Planning for the clinical trial is underway,” said Xie, adding it will be carried out in Australia and other countries since cases have dwindled in China, offering fewer human guinea pigs for testing.“The hope is these neutralised antibodies can become a specialised drug that would stop the pandemic,” he said.China already has five potential coronavirus vaccines at the human trial stage, a health official said last week.But the World Health Organization has warned that developing a vaccine could take 12 to 18 months.Scientists have also pointed to the potential benefits of plasma — a blood fluid — from recovered individuals who have developed antibodies to the virus enabling the body’s defences to attack it.More than 700 patients have received plasma therapy in China, a process which authorities said showed “very good therapeutic effects”.“However, it (plasma) is limited in supply,” Xie said, noting that the 14 neutralising antibodies used in their drug could be put into mass production quickly. Using antibodies in drug treatments is not a new approach, and it has been successful in treating several other viruses such as HIV, Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).Xie said his researchers had “an early start” since the outbreak started in China before spreading to other countries.Ebola drug Remdesivir was considered a hopeful early treatment for COVID-19 — clinical trials in the US showed it shortened the recovery time in some patients by a third — but the difference in mortality rate was not significant.The new drug could even offer short-term protection against the virus.The study showed that if the neutralising antibody was injected before the mice were infected with the virus, the mice stayed free of infection and no virus was detected.This may offer temporary protection for medical workers for a few weeks, which Xie said they are hoping to “extend to a few months”.More than 100 vaccines for COVID-19 are in the works globally, but as the process of vaccine development is more demanding, Xie is hoping that the new drug could be a faster and more efficient way to stop the global march of the coronavirus.“We would be able to stop the pandemic with an effective drug, even without a vaccine,” he said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/hamster-tests-show-masks-reduce-coronavirus-spread-scientists/,Scientists in China believe new drug can stop pandemic ‘without vaccine’,1,"HONG KONG, China (AFP) — Tests on hamsters reveal the widespread use of facemasks reduces transmission of the deadly coronavirus, a team of leading experts in Hong Kong said Sunday.The research by the University of Hong Kong is some of the first to specifically investigate whether masks can stop symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers from infecting others.Led by Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, one of the world’s top coronavirus experts, the team placed hamsters that were artificially infected with the disease next to healthy animals.Surgical masks were placed between the two cages with air flow travelling from the infected animals to the healthy ones.The researchers found non-contact transmission of the virus could be reduced by more than 60 percent when the masks were used.Two thirds of the healthy hamsters were infected within a week if no masks were applied.The infection rate plunged to just over 15 percent when surgical masks were put on the cage of the infected animals and by about 35 percent when placed on the cage with the healthy hamsters.Those that did become infected were also found to have less of the virus within their bodies than those infected without a mask.“It’s very clear that the effect of masking the infected, especially when they are asymptomatic — or symptomatic — it’s much more important than anything else,” Yuen told reporters Sunday.“It also explained why universal masking is important because we now have known that a large number of those infected have no symptom.”Yuen was one of the microbiologists who discovered the SARS virus — a predecessor of the current coronavirus — when it emerged in 2003, killing some 300 people in Hong Kong.Armed with knowledge from that fight, he advised Hong Kongers early in the current pandemic to adopt universal masking, something embraced by the city’s residents.At the time the World Health Organisation and many other foreign health authorities dismissed using masks widely among the public, saying they should instead go to frontline medical workers.Four months after its first COVID-19 case was detected, Hong Kong has largely managed to contain the disease with just over 1,000 infections and four deaths.Experts have credited widespread mask use as well as efficient testing, tracing and treatment in the city of 7.5 million for the relatively low numbers. © Agence France-Presse"

However, these maximum durations are only theoretical because they are recorded under laboratory conditions and should be “interpreted with caution” in the real-world environment."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/from-hospital-to-home-on-the-virus-front-line-with-medics-around-the-world/,says WHO,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — From the hospital ward and the distress of patients dying, to the home front full of fear of infecting their own families, medical workers face gut-wrenching daily decisions more than ever in the fight against the coronavirus.AFPTV journalists followed doctors, nurses, ambulance staff and caregivers on the front line of the virus in Paris, Beirut, Stockholm, Sao Paulo, Los Angeles, Dakar and Daegu at the end of April.Here are snapshots of four of them in action:Soon after Axel Hirwe’s shift begins at 8:30 am, an alarm goes off in the intensive care unit at Argenteuil hospital, 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Paris.Someone has gone into cardiac arrest, the team scrambles, and a pulse is found but the brain has been severely damaged and the patient isn’t expected to last the night.“Unfortunately or fortunately, we get attached to patients,” says intern Hirwe, 29, his eyes full of concern from behind his round glasses.Before having to go on to a ventilator, the patient in question, he says, was breathing by himself, meaning he’d talked and they had got to know a bit about him.“So, it’s very hard after having known the patient, to realize that, in the end, he’s going to die,” he says.Next, five staff are needed to position another patient, one of 40 in the unit, on his stomach to ease his breathing.And then, there are the phone calls to families…“We have to reassure them, but not too much because they do remain in a serious condition, they’re in intensive care, they’re still intubated.“But sometimes they need a bit of hope,” the young masked medic says.Ending the afternoon on a positive note: a diabetic patient has improved and was able to get out of bed.At home, in Clichy, about 10 km from the hospital, Hirwe attempts to relax, not talk shop with his five housemates, and rings his worried mum.“I try to reassure her,” he says. At the other end of the line, she holds up the phone so he can hear the day’s 8:00 pm applause for caregivers. Two ambulances pull up outside the coronavirus emergency department at Rafik Hariri University Hospital in the Lebanese capital.Nurse Ali Awerke, 34, takes charge of one patient while talking to another near the entrance. “I’m coming, just let me get this patient settled and I will come and help you, OK?”All-day long, he is racing. From collecting equipment, bagging up swabs and blood samples, to answering the phone as well as looking after patients.Awerke volunteered for the coronavirus team at the start of the crisis.“I didn’t have clothes with me, I didn’t have anything. I joined the team and called my wife and told her, ‘I’m going to stay here, and unfortunately, I won’t be able to see you all for a while’,” he says.Since then, he’s been living at his parents’ house in Beirut, isolated.But this evening, after testing himself first for the disease, he’s going home to his wife and daughters for the first time in two months.As the call to prayer marking the end of the day’s Ramadan fast rings out, he drives into his village, Es Saksakiye, to surprise his family.The reunion is emotional. Bringing flowers, he kisses his wife; his youngest throws herself into his arms.As a family, they enjoy the evening iftar meal celebrating the end of the day’s fasting.“We’re all going to sleep in the same room, we’re all so happy,” he says.“I missed the house and sitting here on the veranda. It’s been a long time… two months. Maybe for some people, it’s not that long, but for me it was ages.”Places at the ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) unit at Stockholm’s Karolinska University Hospital are few and the demand among patients in severe respiratory distress is high.The equipment used is invasive and the treatment arduous but it can make all the difference.“Hopefully the patients that we bring in here will survive thanks to ECMO treatment which they wouldn’t do with regular ICU (intensive care unit) treatment,” says its head, Lars Falk.But every day demands difficult choices.“We need to really select the right patients and during that selection, of course, we also select people away from ECMO and those are very tough decisions to make,” he says.Once home, the doctor, now sporting a two-day stubble look, recharges the batteries a bit around his family.Often he has a sense of achievement, he says, though it can be hard to really switch off.“I think it’s more that you can dwell on some of the decisions that you’ve made during the day, was it correct or not correct to put this patient on ECMO,” he adds.A death a day is the average at the Emilio Ribas Infectious Disease Institute in Brazil’s biggest city, Sao Paulo.Its intensive care unit has been full since mid-April with seriously ill coronavirus patients.And every day since the start of the crisis, doctor Jaques Sztajnbok, 55, has been at work.Because the disease is new and no established protocols exist, he says that staff has to take it on a day-by-day basis, talking about every case, every day, and testing to see if what works for one patient, will also help another.As head of the unit, he feels he has to set an example, but the doctor with dark circles under his eyes is worried all the time — for his patients, but also for colleagues, several of whom have become ill.“And that’s a worry we’ve never had before, even in other epidemics,” he says.He and his wife, Fabiane Sztajnbok, 47, an infectious disease specialist at the hospital’s emergency room, also worry about the risk of bringing something home with them and about their children.Once home, they remove everything in the hallway, shower and wash their clothes.Nevertheless COVID-19 is still present. “At dinner, we always talk about what happened during their shifts,” says their 10-year-old son Daniel.The Sztajnboks say they feel the need to talk about their days more than ever. Fabiane wakes in the night simply because she is “worried and anxious”.But on this day, it’s Jaques’ 55th birthday.As he blows out his candles and looks at the cards from his children, he says: “Brave, I think that’s an adjective they didn’t use to write on earlier birthday cards.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/zinc-hydroxychloroquine-found-effective-in-some-covid-19-patients-study/,From hospital to home,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine has shown mixed results against the coronavirus in early studies, but a new paper out of New York suggests combining it with the dietary supplement zinc sulfate could create a more effective treatment.The research by the NYU Grossman School of Medicine was posted on a medical preprint site on Monday, meaning it hasn’t yet been peer reviewed.Records of about 900 COVID-19 patients were reviewed in the analysis, with roughly half given zinc sulfate along with hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin.The other half only received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.Those receiving the triple-drug combination had a 1.5 times greater likelihood of recovering enough to be discharged, and were 44 percent less likely to die, compared to the double-drug combination.It did not, however, change the average time patients spent in hospital (six days), the time they spent on the ventilator (five days), or the total amount of oxygen required.Senior investigator and infectious disease specialist Joseph Rahimian told AFP it was the first study to compare the two combinations.But he cautioned that a controlled experiment would be needed to prove the benefits beyond doubt.“The next logical step would be to do a prospective study to see if this holds up in people that you give zinc to, and then you watch and compare,” he said.Hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as a treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus because it has antiviral properties that have been proven in lab settings, but not in people.It interferes with the virus’ ability to enter the cells — and also seems to block them from replicating once they are already inside.Zinc itself has antiviral properties and past research has suggested it may reduce the time people suffer from common colds.Rahimian said that it may be that when used to treat coronavirus patients, it is the zinc that does the heavy lifting and is the primary substance attacking the pathogen.Hydroxychloroquine, on the other hand, acts as an agent that transports the zinc into cells, increasing its efficacy, he suggested.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/shanghai-disneyland-reopens-after-three-month-coronavirus-closure/,on the virus front line with medics around the world,1,", (AFP) — Shanghai Disneyland reopened on Monday following a more than three-month coronavirus shutdown as China moves nearer to normality and Walt Disney Co. seeks to plug the flow of red ink caused by the pandemic.The theme park in China’s most populous city is the first of the entertainment conglomerate’s six main Disney resorts around the world to reopen, but does so under the shadow of the coronavirus.It welcomed a capped number of visitors who had to pre-book tickets, have their temperatures checked on arrival and show a government QR code designed to prove they are not a health risk.On a warm and hazy morning, speakers on a recorded loop asked people to wear masks at all times and reminded them to obey social distancing, including in queues and on rides.Staff held signs instructing “please maintain a proper social distance from other guests” and yellow lines and posters on the ground showed people where to stand when waiting.Disney said there would be increased frequency of sanitisation and disinfection, and the park will limit or suspend performances that often include interaction between visitors and characters such as Mickey Mouse.Despite the measures and persistent fear of new infections, tickets for the first day sold out within minutes after going on sale Friday, Chinese state media said.“Though many areas are still closed we are very much looking forward to the first day of reopening and wondering what’s the difference inside today compared to before,” said a woman who gave the English name “Kitty” and was with her excited five-year-old daughter.“We have stayed at home for around two months and got bored enough.”Andrew Bolstein, senior vice president of operations at the resort, said the “vast majority” of attractions and facilities were open and they will be “adding more and more as time goes on”.Coronavirus emerged in the central city of Wuhan in December and later spread globally, forcing countries around the world to take restrictive prevention measures that have rocked the global economy.But as the first virus-affected country, China also has a head start on returning to normal as the number of reported cases in the country has plummeted.Business activity began resuming in March and last month major tourist sites around the country were reopened and middle and high schools started resuming classes.Walt Disney Co. said last week that profit plunged 91 percent to $475 million in the first three months of the year and that it would suffer a $1.4 billion hit from the coronavirus in the current quarter.The pandemic has dealt a massive blow to the company’s theme parks and other operations.Revenue at its “Parks, Experiences and Products” division fell 10 percent to $5.5 billion in the first three months of the year and the segment’s operating income fell 58 percent, the company said.Disney shuttered the Shanghai park in late January, followed by others in the United States, France, Japan and Hong Kong.Disney CEO Bob Chapek said last week that “we are seeing encouraging signs of a gradual return to some semblance of normalcy in China”.Disney has, meanwhile, delayed the release of more than a dozen major films as cinemas have closed.Revenues from new streaming platform Disney+ have helped limit the damage, however, as home confinement has effectively provided an enormous captive audience.Shanghai Disney reopened its shopping and entertainment Disneytown zone in March, plus a park and hotel in the same complex, but kept the main amusement park closed until now.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pandemic-gives-fresh-momentum-to-digital-voice-technology/,Zinc-hydroxychloroquine found effective in some COVID-19 patients: study,1,", (AFP) — In a world suddenly fearful of touch, voice technology is getting a fresh look.Voice-activated systems such as Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and Apple’s Siri have seen strong growth in recent years, and the virus pandemic could accelerate that, analysts say.Voice assistants are not only answering queries and shopping, but also being used for smart home control and for a range of business and medical applications which could see increased interest as people seek to limit personal contact.“Voice has already made significant inroads into the smart home space and voice control can mean avoiding commonly touched surfaces around the home from smartphones, to TV remotes, light switches, thermostats, door handles and more,” said analyst Jonathan Collins of ABI Research.The pandemic is likely to provide “additional motivation and incentive for voice control in the home that will help drive awareness and adoption for a range of additional smart home devices and applications,” Collins said.ABI estimates that voice control device shipments for smart home devices hit 141 million last year, and in 2020 will grow globally by close to 30 percent.For the broader market of voice assistants, Juniper Research estimates 4.2 billion devices in use this year, growing to 8.4 billion by 2024, with much of the interactions on smartphones.Collins said he expected to see growing interest in smart locks and doorbells, along with other smart home systems, to eliminate the need for personal contact and face-to-face interaction as a result of the pandemic.Avi Greengart, a technology analyst and consultant with Techsponential, said data is not yet available but that “anecdotally, voice assistant usage is way up” as a result of lockdowns.Greengart said he expects a wider range of business applications for voice technologies in response to health and safety concerns.“Looking forward, office spaces will need move towards more touch-free controls; voice can be a solution, although motion triggers for lighting is often easier and more friction-free,” he said.“However, I do expect smart speakers — along with an emailed list of commands — to be a common feature at hotels and other rental properties. The fewer touch points, the better.”Julian Issa of Futuresource Consulting said there appears to be “an uptick in the use of voice assistants since the virus outbreak” during the pandemic.“Whilst avoiding touching surfaces may play a small part in this, it is mainly due to consumers spending far more time at home with their devices,” Issa said.Chris Pennell, another Futuresource analyst, said he expects adoption of digital assistants is likely to accelerate, “especially in client facing areas such as healthcare, retail and entertainment.”One example of this already in use is a Mayo Clinic tool using Amazon Alexa which allows people to assess their symptoms and access information on the virus.Other medical applications are also in the works for voice technologies.Veton Kepuska, a Florida Tech computer engineering professor who specializes in speech recognition technologies, is seeking to develop voice-activated medical robots that can help limit physical contact and contagion.“If we had this infrastructure in place, we would have been better off today,” said Kepuska, who was spurred by the COVID-19 outbreak to seek funding for the research effort.Kepuska said this effort could lead to a “humanoid” medical robot which can take over many tasks from doctors or nurses with voice interaction.“The pandemic has created a situation where we need to think about how to deliver services to people who need our help without putting ourselves in danger,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/anti-viral-drug-trio-found-to-shorten-covid-19-illness-in-mild-cases-study/,Shanghai Disneyland reopens after three-month coronavirus closure,1,"Researchers in Hong Kong have found that patients suffering milder illness caused by the new coronavirus recover more quickly if they are treated with a three-drug antiviral cocktail soon after symptoms appear.Authors of the study, published in the Lancet on Friday, described the findings as “early but important”.They called for larger-scale research on critically-ill patients to ascertain if the drug combo could be a viable treatment for them too.“Our trial demonstrates that early treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 with a triple combination of antiviral drugs may rapidly suppress the amount of virus in a patient’s body,” said Kwok-Yung Yuen, professor at the University of Hong Kong, who led the research.He said the treatment, which appeared safe in patients, was shown to “relieve symptoms, and reduce the risk to health-care workers by reducing the duration and quantity of viral shedding (when the virus is detectable and potentially transmissible)”.Scientists are racing to identify effective medicines to use against the new coronavirus, but there is currently no treatment, cure or vaccine.The study tracked the virus in 127 adults admitted to six hospitals in Hong Kong after they tested positive.Of those participating, 86 patients were given a two-week course of three medicines: interferon beta-1b, a drug used to treat multiple sclerosis; HIV drugs lopinavir-ritonavir; and ribavirin, used to treat hepatitis.A randomly-assigned control group of 41 people was just given the lopinavir-ritonavir combination.Treatment began on average five days after symptoms started and all patients otherwise received standard care, including oxygen therapy.Researchers then measured how long it took for a swab test for the virus to turn out negative.They found that those taking all three medicines were able to clear the coronavirus in seven days on average (between five and 11 days) — “significantly” shorter than the 12-day average for the control group.Those on the three-drug regimen also saw a complete alleviation of their symptoms in an average of four days, compared to eight for the control group.The study was carried out between February 10 and March 20 in Hong Kong, where everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 is admitted to hospital.The authors conceded several limitations with the trial, including that it was “open label” — people knew which drugs they were taking and there was no placebo.Also, patients admitted more than seven days after the onset of symptoms were not given interferon because of concerns that it could cause inflammation.Of these, 34 were given the combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin, while 17 were in the control group.Both of these groups took equally long to clear the virus which, the authors suggested, meant that interferon was key to the shorter illness for the patients treated from the first week of symptoms.“Future clinical study of a double antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b as a backbone is warranted,” the study said.Reacting to the study, Stephen Evans, Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it “justifies the consideration of adding interferon beta to the list of genuinely, evidence-based, promising treatments to be tested in further randomised trials.“It has been clear from long experience that HIV is best treated with combinations of different drugs and this could also be the case with COVID-19,” he added."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/recovery-from-coronavirus-may-not-confer-immunity-warn-experts-2/,Pandemic gives fresh momentum to digital voice technology,1,"Even as virologists zero in on the virus that causes COVID-19, a very basic question remains unanswered: do those who recover from the disease have immunity?There is no clear answer to this question, experts say, even if many have assumed that contracting the potentially deadly disease confers immunity, at least for a while.“Being immunized means that you have developed an immune response against a virus such that you can repulse it,” explained Eric Vivier, a professor of immunology in the public hospital system in Marseilles.“Our immune systems remember, which normally prevents you from being infected by the same virus later on.”For some viral diseases such a measles, overcoming the sickness confers immunity for life.But for RNA-based viruses such as Sars-Cov-2 — the scientific name for the bug that causes the COVID-19 disease — it takes about three weeks to build up a sufficient quantity of antibodies, and even then they may provide protection for only a few months, Vivier told AFP.At least that is the theory. In reality, the new coronavirus has thrown up one surprise after another, to the point where virologists and epidemiologists are sure of very little.“We do not have the answers to that — it’s an unknown,” Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s Emergencies Programme said in a press conference this week when asked how long a recovered COVID-19 patient would have immunity.“We would expect that to be a reasonable period of protection, but it is very difficult to say with a new virus — we can only extrapolate from other coronaviruses, and even that data is quite limited.”For SARS, which killed about 800 people across the world in 2002 and 2003, recovered patients remained protected “for about three years, on average,” Francois Balloux director of the Genetics Institute at University College London, told AFP.“One can certainly get reinfected, but after how much time? We’ll only know retroactively.” A recent study from China that has not gone through peer review reported on rhesus monkeys that recovered from Sars-Cov-2 and did not get reinfected when exposed once again to the virus.“But that doesn’t really reveal anything,” said Pasteur Institute researcher Frederic Tangy, noting that the experiment unfolded over only a month.Indeed,several cases from South Korea — one of the first countries hit by the new coronavirus — found that patients who recovered from COVID-19 later tested positive for the virus.But there are several ways to explain that outcome, scientists cautioned.While it is not impossible that these individuals became infected a second time, there is little evidence this is what happened.More likely, said Balloux, is that the virus never completely disappeared in the first place and remains — dormant and asymptomatic — as a “chronic infection”, like herpes.As tests for live virus and antibodies have not yet been perfected, it is also possible that these patients at some point tested “false negative” when in fact they had not rid themselves of the pathogen.“That suggests that people remain infected for a long time — several weeks,” Balloux added. “That is not ideal.”Another pre-publication study that looked at 175 recovered patients in Shanghai showed different concentrations of protective antibodies 10 to 15 days after the onset of symptoms.“But whether that antibody response actually means immunity is a separate question,” commented Maria Van Kerhove, Technical Lead of the WHO Emergencies Programme.“That’s something we really need to better understand — what does that antibody response look like in terms of immunity.”Indeed, a host of questions remain. “We are at the stage of asking whether someone who has overcome COVID-19 is really that protected,” said Jean-Francois Delfraissy, president of France’s official science advisory board. For Tangy, an even grimmer reality cannot be excluded.“It is possible that the antibodies that someone develops against the virus could actually increase the risk of the disease becoming worse,” he said, noting that the most serious symptoms come later, after the patient had formed antibodies.For the moment, it is also unclear whose antibodies are more potent in beating back the disease: someone who nearly died, or someone with only light symptoms or even no symptoms at all. And does age make a difference?Faced with all these uncertainties, some experts have doubts about the wisdom of persuing a “herd immunity” strategy such that the virus — unable to find new victims — peters out by itself when a majority of the population is immune.“The only real solution for now is a vaccine,” Archie Clements, a professor at Curtin University in Perth Australia, told AFP.At the same time, laboratories are developing a slew of antibody tests to see what proportion of the population in different countries and regions have been contaminated.Such an approach has been favoured in Britain and Finland, while in Germany some experts have floated the idea of an “immunity passport” that would allow people to go back to work.“It’s too premature at this point,” said Saad Omer, a professor of infectious diseases at the Yale School of Medicine.“We should be able to get clearer data very quickly — in a couple of months — when there will be reliable antibody tests with sensitivity and specificity.”One concern is “false positives” caused by the tests detecting antibodies unrelated to COVID-19.The idea of immunity passports or certificates also raises ethical questions, researchers say.“People who absolutely need to work — to feed their families, for example — could try to get infected,” Balloux."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-19-lockdown-risks-1-4-million-extra-tb-deaths-study/,Canada says immigrants welcome after pandemic,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — The global lockdown caused by COVID-19 risks a “devastating” surge in tuberculosis cases, with nearly 1.4 million additional deaths from the world’s biggest infectious killer by 2025, new research showed Wednesday.TB, a bacterial infection that normally attacks patients’ lungs, is largely treatable yet still infects an estimated 10 million people every year.In 2018, it killed around 1.5 million people, according to the World Health Organization, including more than 200,000 children.Since effective medication exists, the world’s TB response is centered on testing and treating as many patients as possible.But as COVID-19 forces governments to place populations on lockdown, new disease models showed that social distancing could lead to a disastrous rebound in TB infections — the effects of which are set to persist for years.This is because social distancing will make it impossible for health care workers to test vulnerable populations and for patients to access ongoing treatments.“In spite of having drugs and treatment… we are not yet close to ending it and TB remains the biggest infectious disease killer,” said Lucica Ditiu, executive director of the Stop TB Partnership.“COVID has hit us very hard. The more people we have not diagnosed and treated the more problems we will have in the coming years.”Models developed in partnership with epidemiologists at Imperial College London used TB response data from three high-incidence countries: India, Kenya and Ukraine.They showed that a two-month global lockdown and a rapid recovery in response programs could lead to more than 1.8 additional TB infections globally over the next five years, and a predicted 340,000 deaths.But if countries fail to quickly reimplement their testing and treatment, the models showed things would get much worse.For example, a three-month lockdown followed by a 10-month “recovery” period could lead to an additional six million infections and 1.4 million TB deaths by 2025.“TB is actually curable with affordable drugs. So a lot of control efforts in recent decades have really been focused in diagnosing cases as quickly as possible,” said Nimalan Arinaminpathy, associate professor in mathematical epidemiology at Imperial.“Lockdowns and other measures against coronavirus are affecting these systems for managing tuberculosis. In fact (in the models) it takes several years for this elevated TB burden to come down to pre-lockdown levels.”The research did not look at the comorbidity between TB, an acute lung infection that leaves even survivors’ lungs compromised, and COVID-19, a viral infection that often leads to lung problems.Cheri Vincent, head of TB division at USAID, said several studies were looking into how TB puts an individual at higher risk of getting sick with COVID-19.“As that information becomes available we may be looking at a much more dire situation,” she said.Suvunand Sahu, deputy executive director of Stop TB Partnership, said there was significant concern over the millions of people living with the infection as COVID-19 spreads.“We know that TB does create damage in the lungs, so when your lung capacity is limited adverse outcomes of COVID would naturally be expected to be higher,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/virus-model-sees-near-doubling-of-us-deaths/,Test equipment found to be contaminated; 40 cases yielded false positives,1,"WASHINGTON DC, United States (AFP) — A prominent US pandemic model on Monday significantly increased its coronavirus death forecast after parts of the country began reopening.The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) now foresees 134,475 deaths by August 4, up from 72,433 projected in an April 29 estimate.On Monday the United States had recorded around 68,000 deaths linked to COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.Previously criticized for being too optimistic, the model’s projections will now be more in line with those of other estimates, several of which have already forecast that the United States would exceed 100,000 deaths by the beginning of June.IHME’s new estimate takes into account the lifting in some states of restrictions on movement and gatherings, as well as residents’ mobility during confinement, thanks to anonymous data provided by phone apps and other platforms.“The social distancing that has occurred has actually, in most settings, been quite effective,” said Christopher Murray, director of IHME based in Seattle at the University of Washington.“There have been many, many states where mobility is starting to go up, even before the social distancing mandates are coming off. So we’re seeing a rise in mobility” which over the last seven to 10 days “is likely leading to some increased transmission,” Murray told reporters.A government document cited on Monday by two US newspapers forecasts that new coronavirus cases will surge to around 200,000 per day by June 1 and the daily death toll will rise to roughly 3,000.The White House said the data did not reflect modeling or analysis done by the president’s coronavirus task force.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/virus-detectives-tracking-covid-19-to-its-genetic-origins/,Virus detectives tracking COVID-19 to its genetic origins,1,", (AFP) — China reported its first cases of the new coronavirus in December. But was COVID-19 already silently circulating? To find out scientists are looking for “patient zeros” by tracking the evolution of the virus itself.This genetic detective work is tracing the family tree of the coronavirus that has killed tens of thousands in its relentless spread across the planet.It could also help find out if the virus was spreading in other countries before the first infections were officially recorded.In France, a cluster of cases was discovered in late January.But a new study published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents has suggested the virus was already in the country a month earlier.A retrospective analysis of samples taken from 14 intensive care patients with influenza-like symptoms at the Avicenne and Jean-Verdier hospitals in Paris found one positive COVID-19 case — a 42-year-old French resident who had not visited China. He was hospitalised on December 27.Olivier Bouchaud, head of the infectious diseases department at Avicenne said at first the virus spreads “quietly in the population, without anyone detecting its presence”.So evidence of earlier infections would only confirm what many scientists had suspected, he told AFP.It might also help explain cases like that of Aicha, a 57-year-old medical secretary who was hospitalised in Marseille in mid-January with severe respiratory symptoms.At the time the mysterious outbreak of pneumonia cases in the Chinese city of Wuhan was still seen as a faraway problem.France did not have a single case and the World Health Organization was still weeks away from giving it the name COVID-19.Aicha’s husband Jacques, a doctor, said she had “all the clinical signs” of the disease, including loss of taste and smell. But her tests have been inconclusive.Other countries are discovering they may have had earlier infections. In the United States, autopsies performed on suspicious deaths in California have revealed infections before the first official case on January 21.But Samuel Alizon, of the French National Centre for Scientific Research at Montpellier University, has cautioned that it is important to distinguish between isolated cases and the origin of the “epidemic wave”.In China, Wuhan health authorities have spoken of an initial case on December 8.A study published in The Lancet in January said the first patient identified in the city started showing symptoms on December 1.The timeline has been roughly corroborated by research mapping out the genetic evolution of the virus.So far the genomes of more than 15,000 samples of the new coronavirus have been sequenced. As it replicates it produces multiple mutations, although none has been found to change its virulence.Alizon said that about twice a month a mutation happens that stays in the genetic sequence, giving researchers a trail to follow.So “if you compare two viruses, you can count how many mutations separate them,” he said. Following the chain we find the “ancestor common to all infections”.Using publicly shared genome sequences, Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh found that the “lack of diversity is indicative of a relatively recent common ancestor for all these viruses”.He estimated that this ancestor could have emerged around November 17 last year (with a range of uncertainty between August 27 and December 29).Imperial College London, in collaboration with the WHO, has also traced the virus’ family tree, estimating that it appeared in China on December 5 (with a margin of uncertainty between November 6 and December 13).Erik Volz, an epidemiologist at Imperial College, said all of the very earliest genetic sequences of the virus collected in Wuhan in December and January “have almost identical genomes”.“And all viruses currently circulating elsewhere in the world are descended from these closely related lineages in Wuhan,” he told AFP.But experts do not think of an epidemic as having a single starting point in time, he added: rather, they are seeded “multiple times from multiple points of origin”.He said estimates of the dates of these “seeding events” suggests the epidemics in many European and North American cities began in mid-January or early February.Italian research suggests the virus arrived in Lombardy between the second half of January and the beginning of February — weeks before the first infections were confirmed on February 20.Football players for Inter Milan have said they suffered symptoms of the virus at the beginning of the year. Could they have had it?“We had a week off in December and then we went back to work and I swear that 23 out of 25 players were sick,” Belgian Inter Milan striker Romelu Lukaku said in a recent radio interview.The players were not tested for the virus at the time.Even if they took serological tests now and antibodies were found in their blood, it would not confirm when they were infected.“We will never know,” said Lukaku.© Agence France-Presse"

That statement might be staggering for to those who might have envisioned Los Angeles as a sprawling metropolis with a bustling economy. But in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, the problem of feeding such a large population is all the more magnified.That’s where organizations like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank stepped in. Since 1973, the food bank has been on a mission to help Angelenos struggling to feed themselves or their families by providing food or their food distribution centers.But with so many residents staying at home, and with layoffs and unemployment rising, the food bank has seen the number of their volunteers go down. Putting a strain on non-profit companies’ finance.Some companies have even had to shut down operations forced to wait out the COVID-19 storm. However, not all sponsorships have ground to a halt. In fact, during this critical time, a number of businesses and organizations have actually stepped up donations to help support the functional needs of the food bank.The county of Los Angeles is one such partner reporting today that they earned more than $3 million for that Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. The money is planned to directly increase food supplies and to ensure that distribution to communities in need will continue.Donations are still highly sought out by the LA Regional Food Bank because of the ongoing pandemic. The expectation is that the number of job losses will continue to rise, which means that the number of people experiencing food insecurity will also follow suit.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/remdesivir-the-covid-19-drug-helping-patients-recover-faster/,Remdesivir: The COVID-19 drug helping patients recover faster,1,"Remdesivir has been shown to speed up recovery times for patients with COVID-19 in a major US-led trial, becoming the first drug with proven benefit against the disease.Here is what you need to know. Remdesivir is an experimental, broad spectrum antiviral made by US pharmaceutical Gilead Sciences that was first developed to treat Ebola, a viral hemorrhagic fever.It showed early promise in a primate study in 2016 and was later rolled out for a major trial in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it was compared against three other medicines.That study concluded in 2019 when it was discontinued because it did not boost survival rates as greatly as two monoclonal antibody drugs, which are lab-engineered immune system proteins.In February, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced it was dusting off remdesivir to investigate against SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes COVID-19, because it had shown promise in animal testing against fellow coronaviruses SARS and MERS. The NIAID announced the results of its trial involving more than 1,000 people on Wednesday, finding that hospitalized COVID-19 patients with respiratory distress got better quicker than those on a placebo.Specifically, patients on the drug had a 31 percent faster time to recovery.“Although the results were clearly positive from a statistically significant standpoint, they were modest,” Anthony Fauci, the scientist who leads the NIAID told NBC News on Thursday.In other words, while it works, it’s not a miracle cure.It is however considered a “proof of concept” that could pave the way for better treatments — just as the early medicines developed to treat HIV in the 1980s weren’t nearly as effective as those used today.The results suggested remdesivir might lower mortality rates — from 11.7 percent to 8.0 percent, but this data is considered less reliable because it was above the cut-off of statistical significance. The findings from the US-led trial were announced on the same day as the results of a smaller study were published in The Lancet, which found no statistical benefit from remdesivir.This study involved just over 200 people in Wuhan, China, and was also a randomized controlled trial — considered the gold standard for evaluating treatments.Importantly, however, it had to be stopped early because it could not recruit enough patients, and was roughly five times smaller than the NIAID study.“The numbers in the trial are too small to draw strong conclusions,” said Stephen Evans, a medical statistics expert at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Remdesivir has already been given to patients around the world, both in clinical trials and outside, with Gilead responding to “compassionate use requests” for emergency access.In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is soon expected to issue an “emergency use authorization” which would expand its use further, prior to its formal approval.“I was speaking with the commissioner of the FDA yesterday evening, last night, and he’s moving along very quickly,” Fauci said Thursday.“They have not made a final decision yet, they have not announced it, but I would project that we’re going to be seeing that reasonably soon.”Since the medicine is complex to manufacture and is administered via injection, rather than a pill, there have been questions about whether supply could initially be limited.In an open letter published late Wednesday, Daniel O’Day, Gilead’s chairman, wrote that the company currently had 1.5 million doses either finished or nearly finished.“We had estimated that this would be 140,000 treatment courses based on a 10-day treatment duration,” he said, but another trial has shown that five-day courses are as effective as ten.This means “we can significantly increase the number of courses available, all of which Gilead has committed for donation,” said O’Day.The company is also looking into potentially developing an inhaled formulation, but hasn’t given a timeline. Remdesivir belongs to a class of drugs that directly attack viruses.It is what’s called a “nucleotide analog” that mimics adenosine, one of the four building blocks of RNA and DNA.“The virus is not very careful about what it incorporates,” said virologist Benjamin Neuman, of Texas A&M University.“Viruses usually try to go fast and they trade speed for caution.”Remdesivir sneakily incorporates itself into the virus’s genome instead of adenosine, which in turn short circuits its replication process.Speaking during an earnings call Thursday, Gilead’s chief medical officer Merdad Parsey said that while patients who had had symptoms for less time seemed to respond better to the medicine, there also appeared to be some benefit for those who were more critical.This is because the virus triggers an abnormal immune reaction called cytokine storm responsible for lung injury.“By limiting the viral replication, you’re going to limit the inflammation, you’re going to reduce the number of people who develop lung injury, and you’re going to get them off the ventilator faster,” said Parsey."

Despite all of this, a blessing came to us,” he added.And so, Covid Marie it was.Weeks earlier, two mothers in southeastern India had had similar ideas, apparently encouraged by a doctor in the hospital where their babies were delivered.One was called Corona Kumar and the other Corona Kumari.“I told them this would help create awareness about the disease and remove the stigma around it,” said S.F. Basha, the doctor.“To my surprise, they agreed.”Not to be outdone, a migrant-worker couple in India’s northeast stranded thousands of kilometers from their home in the desert state of Rajasthan decided to name their child Lockdown.“We named him Lockdown remembering all the problems we had to face during this tough time,” local media reports quoted the father Sanjay Bauri as saying.Tupas, the father of baby Covid Marie, said that while he had fielded criticism on social media for his unorthodox choice, he would not be swayed.“She might experience bullying, but I’ll just teach my daughter to be a good person,” he said.“We didn’t have second thoughts.”"

This inter-agency effort is reflective of the ‘Bayanihan to Heal as One Act’ the success of which will not only help our Covid-19 patients, but also benefit our marginal coconut farmers,” said Agriculture Secretary William Dar.The study with an initial funding of P5 million is two-pronged.First, a community-based modified clinical study on the use of VCO, involving persons under investigation for Covid-19 infection who exhibit symptoms of the disease would be done.The tests are being conducted by the FNRI with DOST-4A, Santa Rosa City government, in Laguna, and Medical City South Luzon.Second, the VCO is used as a supplement to the daily treatment regimen — in addition to the pharmaceutical drugs being assessed in clinical trials — of Covid-19 positive patients at PGH. This is already being done at PGH.Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said that the DOST is already leading other agencies in the conduct of current studies on the use of VCO as supplement for COVID-19 patients in various hospitals and community quarantine facilities.PCA administrator Benjamin Madrigal, Jr. said previous researches have shown that VCO has high potency anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal qualities.“Initial research results show that the lauric acid in VCO helps fight the corona virus in three ways, as it: disintegrates the virus membrane; inhibits virus maturation; and prevents binding of viral proteins to the host cell membrane,” said Madrigal in a statement.“To ensure the success of said research studies, the PCA is providing all the quality VCO that has passed stringent laboratory analysis for its physio-chemical, microbial and heavy metal content,” said Madrigal Jr, noting that the agency shared P1.4 million in the inter-agency initiative.The PCA will also support all the clinical laboratory tests in the community-based studies to determine the anti-viral and immune system boosting qualities of VCO, a DA statement said.“With this favorable development, the demand for VCO has started to pick up with the on-going confirmatory clinical research at UP-PGH and at the community quarantine facility in Sta. Rosa, Laguna,” Madrigal said.DA Secretary Dar also commended and urged the PCA to institute innovative strategies to further increase the production of quality VCO nationwide, and thus provide coconut farmers a stable market and steady income"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-19-to-cause-record-emissions-fall-in-2020-iea/,000 to support children during pandemic,1,", (AFP) — COVID-19 is expected to cause global energy emissions to fall a record eight percent this year due to an unprecedented drop in demand for coal, oil and gas, the International Energy Agency said Thursday.The IEA’s Global Energy Review was based on an analysis of electricity demand over more than 100 days, during which much of the world has entered lockdown in a bid to control the pandemic.It predicted that global energy demand would fall six percent in 2020 — seven times more than during the 2008 financial crisis and the biggest year-on-year drop since World War II.This would be the equivalent of losing the entire energy demand of India, the world’s third-largest power consumer, the IEA said.Advanced economies are set to see the biggest declines, with demand in the United States down nine percent and an 11-percent fall in the European Union likely.“This is a historic shock to the entire energy world,” said IEA executive director Fatih Birol.“The plunge in demand for nearly all major fuels is staggering, especially for coal, oil and gas.”With consumption falling, the IEA said it had noticed a “major shift” to low-carbon sources of power, such as wind and solar, which are set to make up 40 percent of global electricity generation — six percentage points more than coal.Coal and natural gas “are finding themselves increasingly squeezed between low overall power demand and increasing output from renewables,” the report said.Natural gas demand is set to fall five percent in 2020 after a decade of uninterrupted growth.Following a 2018 peak, coal-fired power generation is set to fall more than 10 percent this year.Overall, energy-related carbon emissions are set to fall by almost eight percent, reaching their lowest level since 2010.If this plays out this would be by far the largest annual decrease on record, more than six times larger than the 2009 fall precipitated by the global financial crisis.The United Nations says CO2 emissions must fall by 7.6 percent annually through to 2030 in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.6 Farenheit), the most ambitious temperature cap of the Paris climate accord.Until COVID-19 struck, emissions had been rising year on year.Reacting to the IEA’s report, Richard Black, Director of the Britain-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said how the global economy recovered in the long term from the pandemic would be key for the climate.“In recent weeks there have been robust promises from national leaders and calls from businesses for post-coronavirus stimulus packages to accelerate the clean energy transition,” Black said.“If these pledges come good… then the crisis could come to be seen as a genuine turning point for world energy markets.”© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/despite-virus-outbreaks-us-meat-plants-told-to-stay-open/,oldest COVID-19 survivor: over 2-week old baby and 95-yr old man,1,", US slaughterhouses are being forced to stay open on government orders despite deadly coronavirus outbreaks among workers, as authorities move to ensure supermarkets are fully stocked with meat.President Donald Trump signed the executive order on Tuesday under the Defense Production Act, a law designed for use in wartime to divert private business for defense and security needs.Several major plants where farmers send cattle, pigs and poultry have shut due to the rapid spread of COVID-19 between employees, who are often in close proximity on production lines and on breaks.At least 18 plants across the United States have been temporarily closed in the last two months, cutting pork processing capacity by as much as 20 percent and beef processing capacity by 10 percent, the Farm Bureau industry group said.“In some cases, the closures were due to outbreaks among workers at the plants. In other cases it is a struggle to keep workers, who are afraid of getting sick, coming into the plant,” it said.The stoppages raise the risk of empty shelves in US stores, while — on the production end — breeders have nowhere to send their animals to slaughter.Cows can continue to graze, but many pigs are fattened indoors on a tight schedule and, if they become too fat, they lose their value and can be injured.The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has set up a special unit to support farmers who need to process animals, including helping breeders to slaughter them themselves.“The president’s executive order will help avert hardship for agricultural producers and keep safe, affordable food on the tables of American families,” said Julie Anna Potts, president of the Meat Institute, which represents meat packers and processors.Slaughterhouse owners say they have introduced extra sanitation measures to protect workers, including screening tests, temperature checks, face gear and plexiglass shields.But unions say that management did not take the situation seriously enough and the precautions came too late.The shuttered Smithfield Foods plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where some 3,700 people usually slaughter, butcher and process thousands of pigs every day, “is very old,” Kooper Caraway, local leader of the AFL-CIO union, told AFP.“The hallways are very narrow, the locker rooms are small, the lunch rooms are small,” he said.“Not only are workers working shoulder to shoulders on the assembly line, but they are… changing clothes and eating shoulder to shoulder.“The plant instituted all the changes that workers requested but by then several dozens workers had already tested positive and the plant was already a hot spot.”The United Food and Commercial Workers union says 20 meat industry employees have died and at least 6,500 have been affected.“For the sake of all our families, we must prioritize the safety and security of these workers,” said union president Marc Perrone, calling for authorities to closely monitor prevention measures taken by companies.Food and Water Watch, a non-profit group that campaigns for greater accountability in the food chain, denounced giant meat companies for claiming there was a risk of shortages despite high levels of frozen beef and chicken.“It’s crucial the food industry protects workers by closing plants when necessary in order to keep the food system from collapsing entirely,” its government affairs representative Tony Corbo said.“The federal government should be stepping in … to get our abundant frozen meat supplies to stores and food banks that need them.”© Agence France-Presse"

We have absolutely no medical explanation at this stage.“Is it an inflammatory reaction which sets off a pre-existing condition in children who have this virus or is it another infectious disease? There are a lot of questions.The minister urged international and French experts to gather as much data as possible to establish if a link can be made between the coronavirus and the new symptoms, “which until now had not been seen anywhere”.France intends to re-open primary schools from May 11 and the minister noted that children had largely escaped COVID-19 infection and that serious cases involved those with underlying conditions."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-govt-reveals-details-of-sunlight-study-on-virus/,minister says,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The US Department of Homeland Security revealed to AFP on Tuesday new technical details regarding its highly anticipated study into how ultraviolet radiation destroys the new coronavirus, saying that its experiment had accurately mimicked natural sunlight.A summary of the research was presented last week at the White House, with some scientists calling for caution until a more comprehensive report was made public.US President Donald Trump raised eyebrows last week when he used his daily live national press briefing to ask whether light could become a medical treatment.“Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light,” he said. “Supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way.”Trump continued on to suggest that people inject disinfectants to cure the virus, an idea that health experts quickly shot down.DHS official William Bryan had briefed the media that the amount of virus on a non-porous surface shrunk by half in just two minutes when sunlight was present, the temperature was 70-75 degrees Fahrenheit (21-24 Celsius) and humidity was 80 percent.The amount of virus suspended in air shrunk to half its amount in just 1.5 minutes at room temperature and 20 percent humidity, he added.These eye-catching results surprised experts because most of the UV light contained in natural sunlight belongs to a subtype called UVA, which causes human skin to tan and age but has not generally been proven harmful to viruses, David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Medical Center, told AFP.On the other hand, a part of the spectrum called UVC is particularly adept at warping the genetic material of animal and virus cells and is widely used in sterilizing lamps, but it is not present in sunlight because it is filtered out by the Earth’s atmosphere.Asked for further details on the type of UV light that was used, Lloyd Hough, a DHS scientist overseeing the test, said: “The spectrum of light that was used was designed to approximate natural sunlight that you would expect to see at noon at sea level at a mid-latitude location (e.g., mid-Atlantic, 40 degrees N) on the first day of summer.“More specifically, it approximates the wavelengths of light predicted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s (NCAR) Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible (TUV) Radiation Model for noon at 40 degrees N latitude at sea level on June 21st in range of 280 and 400 nanometer wavelengths.”The wavelengths specified pertain only to long- and medium-wave ultraviolet, also known as UVA and UVB — the UV components of sunlight that penetrate the atmosphere — and not UVC. A DHS spokesman added that the test — which was conducted at the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center in Maryland — was carried out on droplets of simulated saliva on a stainless steel surface.Brenner, who is himself performing research into another area of the UV spectrum called far-UVC, which kills microbes without penetrating human skin, said the DHS findings did not comport with previous research.“There is a peer-reviewed paper in the literature from the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) showing the earlier SARS-CoV virus did not respond to UVA light (though it did respond to UVC light),” he said, adding it is “reasonable to assume that all coronaviruses respond roughly the same way to light.”The results as presented were “straining credulity,” he added.But a DHS spokesman said that study would soon be submitted for peer review and published in scientific journals.“While the results are still undergoing a rigorous scientific review, we felt it important to share information on the emerging trends that are being identified in our tests,” the spokesman said. ©"

Their findings were published in the Journal of The American College of Cardiology.The experts found the risks were so great that COVID-19 patients “may need to receive blood thinners, preventively, prophylactically,” even before imaging tests are ordered, said Bikdeli.What exactly is causing it? The reasons aren’t fully understood, but he offered several possible explanations.People with severe forms of COVID-19 often have underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease — which are themselves linked to higher rates of clotting.Next, being in intensive care makes a person likelier to develop a clot because they are staying still for so long. That’s why for example people are encouraged to stretch and move around on long haul flights.It’s also now clear the COVID-19 illness is associated with an abnormal immune reaction called “cytokine storm” — and some research has indicated this too is linked to higher rates of clotting.There could also be something about the virus itself that is causing coagulation, which has some precedent in other viral illnesses.A paper in the journal The Lancet last week showed that the virus can infect the inner cell layer of organs and of blood vessels, called the endothelium. This, in theory, could interfere with the clotting process.According to Brosnahan, while thinners like Heparin are effective in some patients, they don’t work for all patients because the clots are at times too small.“There are too many microclots,” she said. “We’re not sure exactly where they are.”Autopsies have in fact shown some people’s lungs filled with hundreds of microclots.The arrival of a new mystery however helps solve a slightly older one.Cecilia Mirant-Borde, an intensive care doctor at a military veterans hospital in Manhattan, told AFP that lungs filled with microclots helped explain why ventilators work poorly for patients with low blood oxygen.Earlier in the pandemic doctors were treating these patients according to protocols developed for acute respiratory distress syndrome, sometimes known as “wet lung.”But in some cases, “it’s not because the lungs are occupied with water” — rather, it’s that the microclotting is blocking circulation and blood is leaving the lungs with less oxygen than it should.It has just been a little under five months since the virus emerged in Wuhan, China, and researchers are learning more about its impact every day.“While we react surprised, we shouldn’t be as surprised as we were. Viruses tend to do weird things,” said Brosnahan.While the dizzying array of complications may seem daunting, “it’s possible there’ll be one or a couple of unifying mechanisms that describe how this damage happens,” she said.“It’s possible it’s all the same thing, and that there’ll be the same solution.”© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/tunisia-hopes-novel-methods-will-aid-virus-fight/,frontline workers showing no symptoms,1,", (AFP) — The feared impact of coronavirus on Tunisia’s fragile public health system has provoked a flurry of innovation from robotics to digitalisation efforts to bolster the North African country’s pandemic response.The government has even turned to students for help, asking the engineering school in Sousse, south of the capital Tunis, to task its students with designing a locally made ventilator as their end-of-year project.Ventilators are crucial for treating critically ill COVID-19 patients, but as in many countries, Tunisia’s poorly equipped hospitals lack sufficient numbers of the devices.Costs and delivery times for ventilators have increased dramatically.“Students, teachers and doctors have come up with a functioning prototype,” said Aref Meddeb, the school’s director.“This is the first time these machines have been made in Tunisia. It shows that there is real potential here.”Other Tunisian researchers have developed plans for a simplified respirator made with 3-D printed parts.It will soon be made freely available, allowing undeveloped countries without access to sophisticated equipment to make their own.“We are using everything that we can find open source and the help of a Tunisian engineer specialised in respirators,” said Khalil Allouch, an engineering student on the local respirator project based in Tunis.“This crisis has shown us we can be more self-sufficient.”Tunisia graduates thousands of doctors and engineers with internationally recognised qualifications annually. But with low salaries and few local opportunities, many emigrate.While Tunisian laboratories are struggling to keep up with COVID-19 testing, Tunisia was one of the first countries in the region to decode the local strain of the virus, a necessary step towards developing a vaccine.The Pasteur Institute in Tunis is one of few African institutions leading research into a vaccine.“Other countries are in more advanced stages but that doesn’t guarantee that we will have rapid access to vaccines,” said Hechmi Louzir, director of the institute.“If we managed (to develop a vaccine), it would be extraordinary.”On the diagnostic side, Tunis engineering school Insat is working on an artificial intelligence programme to evaluate the probability of infection based on an X-ray of the lungs.“The crisis has exposed us,” Prime Minister Elyes Fakhfakh admitted on television, but it has also “revealed solid competence” in the fields of information technology and artificial intelligence.“After coronavirus we will rebuild on this basis,” he said.Tunisia has reported 38 deaths and fewer than 1,000 cases of coronavirus, but the impact of the lockdown in effect since March 22 has decimated the economy.The government is eager to highlight the Tunisian response to the virus, creating a website to showcase the country’s many innovations both by government and non-government bodies.These include digitisation efforts by previously technophobic government bodies.The interior ministry has even started issuing some documents — waivers for movement during lockdown — online.The health ministry has adopted an application developed by students to track hospital bed availability and facilitate transfers and the deployment of extra emergency bed space.In the private sector, a Tunisian robotics company is developing devices for policing and to help with screening patients on arrival at hospital.“We are not overwhelmed yet,” said Dr Jalila Ben Khelil, head of the country’s main COVID-19 unit. But “we need to explore all avenues to get out” of this situation.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/hopes-grow-for-antibody-tests-but-experts-urge-caution/,Tunisia hopes novel methods will aid virus fight,1,"BERLIN, Germany (AFP) — The sun is only just rising in Berlin but Lothar Kopp, 65, is already standing in line outside a clinic in the district of Reinickendorf.Along with a handful of mask-clad people standing two metres apart, he is here to give a blood sample — for antibody tests in the hope of finding out if he has previously contracted the coronavirus and since developed immunity.“If I’ve already had corona then I’m not infectious,” said Kopp, hoping to test positive for antibodies as it could allow him to visit his elderly mother without the risk of spreading the disease.As nations around the world look to ease curbs on public life, some experts have mooted the possibility of so-called “immunity passports” to allow those who have antibodies to return to work first.In Germany, tens of thousands of tests have been performed and large studies are ongoing.Elsewhere in the world, efforts are also under way to determine the so-called level of immunity in the population.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said last week that the state will be launching tests “in the most aggressive way in the nation” to find out how many have already had the disease.In a rush to catch up with testing, the US regulator had even taken the extraordinary decision to allow commercial manufacturers to market their tests without formal authorisation.But experts including from the World Health Organization have urged caution over the accuracy of the nascent tests.Among the unknowns of the virus is how long immunity could last — meaning that even positive antibody tests may not be meaningful for long.– ‘Nonsense’ – Urging prudence, a WHO spokeswoman noted that there is “much discussion” over the antibody tests.But “once we have validated tests we may still not know how well a positive result correlates with protection against disease or for how long the protection will last,” she told AFP.Matthias Orth, a board member of the Professional Association of German Laboratory Doctors (BDL), said inaccuracies are a big problem.People can test negative even if they have had COVID-19, he said.“There are also quite banal coronaviruses that do not cause serious illness, and they can give a positive result.”As for so-called rapid antibody tests — home kits that extract blood from your finger and promise a result within 15 minutes — Orth’s verdict: “They’re nonsense.”More accurate tests will come within weeks, he said, but he stressed that “it’s a little too early to give patients a clear statement that they are definitely immune”. Experts also note that while large-scale studies underway across Europe’s biggest economy can serve to determine what proportion of the population has been infected, they cannot say for sure how many people are actually immune given the limitations on current antibodies tests.Nevertheless, the studies, including one that started in Munich over the weekend with scientists picking 3,000 households at random to test for antibodies, are being closely watched.A separate study is ongoing in Gangelt, in the Heinsberg district — where Germany’s first major cluster of infections was uncovered. So far, researchers have determined that 14 percent of the population had previously been infected.Beyond studies, several pharmaceutical companies in Germany have also begun marketing such antibody tests — which must be analysed in a laboratory.And around 70,000 tests have so far been processed by 54 laboratories, according to the ALM association of accredited medical laboratories.Doctor Ulrike Leimer-Lipke of the Reinickendorf clinic, which has been offering antibody tests since mid-March, said: “I think it makes a lot of sense, because this way we can find out if people have immunity.“It is very important for people if they have a grandmother or a mother or father who they care for, to know if they are already immune.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/does-sunlight-rapidly-destroy-the-coronavirus/,Filipino-designed handwashers help battle coronavirus in Ethiopia,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Does sunlight rapidly destroy the coronavirus? A White House presentation on a mysterious government study says so — but some scientists have called for caution as we await more evidence.An official from the Department of Homeland Security made the eye-catching announcement during President Donald Trump’s daily pandemic briefing Thursday, showing a dramatic reduction in the virus’ viability under the sun’s rays.But the fact there are no further details about how the study was conducted has left some experts scratching their heads.“It looks like someone did a test somewhere,” Benjamin Neuman, chair of biological sciences at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, told AFP.“It would be good to know how the test was done.”William Bryan, the official who summarized the findings, told reporters that an experiment was carried out at the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center in Maryland.On a stainless steel surface in sunlight, the virus shrinks to half its amount in a matter of just two minutes in 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 degrees Celsius) heat and 80 percent humidity, compared to six hours in the dark.When the virus was suspended in the air, its half-life in sunlight was just a minute and a half when the temperature was 70 to 75 degrees with 20 percent humidity, as opposed to one hour in the dark.Beyond the headline results, there are so far few details, making it impossible for experts to independently validate the findings.“As a scientist, I’d of course like to see an actual study and the actual numbers,” viral epidemiologist Chris von Csefalvay told AFP. We do know that the solar radiation contained in ultraviolet light — an invisible, energetic part of the electromagnetic spectrum — can be very effective at dealing with certain pathogens.That is why, for example, the World Health Organization recommends that people in developing countries can place tap water in plastic bottles and leave them under the sun for five hours in order to make it drinkable.But not all microbes respond in the same way.Sunlight in fact contains different types of ultraviolet radiation, which are classed by their wavelength.Broadly speaking, these can be categorized into UVA, which causes the skin to tan and age; UVB, which is a bit more harmful in high doses and can cause burning and cancer, and UVC, which is the most dangerous.Most of the sunlight that penetrates our atmosphere is UVA while UVC is completely filtered out.That is good news for us: UVC has small, high energy waves that are particularly adept at warping genetic material, whether in animal cells or in viruses.A 2004 study on SARS — a close genetic relative of the new coronavirus — found that UVA light “had no effect on viability, regardless of duration of exposure.”UVC light — which is commonly used to sterilize labs, hospitals and now even buses in China — completely inactivated the virus within 15 minutes. It is entirely possible that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is more vulnerable to regular sunlight than its older cousin, and not just UVC.The problem is the DHS has bypassed scientific norms by not making its data available — even in its preliminary, non peer-reviewed form, which is how most major research during this pandemic has first made its way into the public domain.“It would be really important for understanding this study to know how it was conducted, and I am quite hopeful that the actual paper, or at least a pre-print, will be shared soon,” said von Csefalvay.“I know for a fact that the scientific community is eager to review their findings.”But even if all the findings are airtight, solar disinfection is probably going to have a limited impact.After all, people are less likely to be infected outdoors than indoors, unless they are directly coughed or sneezed upon — in which case UV rays won’t have time to inactivate the viral droplets before they hit their target.On the other hand, UVB can help boost the immune system by causing the body to produce more Vitamin D.All of this points to the need for more research. But one thing is clear: President Trump’s suggestion that UV could be used to treat patients already infected with the virus isn’t grounded in fact.“There is no way currently that UV could be used to irradiate inside the body that would do any good,” Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia said."

We must make sure that the people who need them get them.”“The lessons from AIDS must be learned,” he said, pointing to the many millions who had died before anti-retroviral drugs were made widely accessible.“We must leave no one behind.”"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/oxford-university-pushing-science-to-the-limit-in-vaccine-hunt/,Oxford University pushing science to the limit in vaccine hunt,1,", (AFP) — Oxford University is launching a human trial of a potential coronavirus vaccine, with the daunting aim of making a successful jab available to the public later this year.Of the more than 100 research projects around the world to find a vaccine — described by the United Nations as the only route back to “normality” — seven are currently in clinical trials, according to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Such trials are already underway in China and the United States and are due to begin at the end of this month in Germany, where the federal vaccine authority gave the green light on Wednesday.The British government strongly supports Oxford University’s work, and the first human trials were to start on Thursday, Health Minister Matt Hancock said.He hailed the “promising development”, pointing out that it would normally take “years” to reach such a stage of vaccine development.In its first phase, half of 1,112 volunteers will receive the potential vaccine against COVID-19, the other half a control vaccine to test its safety and efficacy.The volunteers are aged between 18 and 55, are in good health, have not tested positive for COVID-19 and are not pregnant or breastfeeding.Ten participants will receive two doses of the experimental vaccine, four weeks apart.Professor Sarah Gilbert’s team hopes for an 80 percent success rate, and plans to produce one million doses by September, with the aim of making it widely available by the autumn if successful.But the teams carrying out this research say on their website that this timetable is “highly ambitious” and could change.The government’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty acknowledged on Wednesday that the likelihood of getting a vaccine within the year was “incredibly small”.“If people are hoping it’s suddenly going to move from where we are in lockdown to where suddenly into everything is gone, that is a wholly unrealistic expectation,” he warned.The strategy of not waiting for each step to be completed before launching production is a financial “gamble”, according to Nicola Stonehouse, professor of molecular virology at the University of Leeds.But the current crisis makes it a necessary gamble, she told AFP.The Oxford vaccine is based on a chimpanzee adenovirus, which is modified to produce proteins in human cells that are also produced by COVID-19.It is hoped the vaccine will teach the body’s immune system to then recognise the protein and help stop the coronavirus from entering human cells.The adenovirus vaccine is known to develop a strong immune response with a single dose and is not a replicating virus, so cannot cause infection, making it safer for children, the elderly and patients with underlying diseases such as diabetes.The government, under fire in the media over its handling of the crisis, set up a task force last weekend to coordinate research efforts and to develop capability to mass-produce a vaccine as soon as it is available, wherever it comes from.It is also supporting research at Imperial College London, which hopes to start clinical trials in June.Their research focuses on a vaccine exploiting a different principle, using RNA, the messenger molecules that build proteins in the cells, to stimulate the immune system.Finding a vaccine is the only possible way to bring the world back to “normality”, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week, calling for an acceleration of projects.The UN on Monday adopted a resolution calling for “equitable, effective and rapid” access to a possible vaccine.© Agence France-Presse"

Once touched down in the Aloha state, the homecoming was different from what these soldiers are used to.“It is what it is. We understand that there are limitations that there are constraints outside of our understanding and outside of our control and you know we’ll just roll with it” says Capt. Matro.Instead of a grand welcome with hugs and kisses to family members, cars lined up outside and waited for their soldier. Trying to maintain social distance, soldiers trickled out of the building a few at a time, promptly leaving the facility once in the car.But Capt. Matro also believes that the new procedures did not dampen the excitement of troops who are simply looking forward to come home to be with friends and loved ones.“It’s great that [Military] leadership came out, it’s great that we had the support of our community. It wasn’t the Welcome home that we expected but at least we got something.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-starts-contact-tracing-the-old-fashioned-way-but-its-late/,US starts contact tracing the old-fashioned way,1,", (AFP) — Taiwan and South Korea have led the world in digital contact tracing for the COVID-19 pandemic — an example the US with its emphasis on personal privacy and decentralized system of government is unlikely to be able to follow.Instead, states and cities are opting to hire thousands of public health workers who will have to carry out the laborious task of phoning everyone with a confirmed case.They’ll want to know, in turn, everyone that the patient came into close contact with — defined as less than six feet (two meters) — for 15 minutes or longer. These people will then be called and asked to self quarantine.It’s painstaking work that can complement the opt-in mobile phone based contact tracing, announced by Apple and Google recently. The investigators, who don’t require medical training, work from home, using computer software, and each call takes at least half an hour.Massachusetts was the first to launch its program at the start of April, announcing it would recruit 1,000 contact tracers (17,000 have applied). San Francisco has announced a similar initiative, and other states and jurisdictions are also starting up.“It’s late,” said Dr Joia Mukherjee, chief medical officer of Partners in Health, the nonprofit chosen by Massachusetts to manage its program. “It would have been easier to do it after the first case.”But it’s still possible to catch up, she said. “All epidemics are highly localized. If we look at the top line numbers, everyone just gets terrified. But it’s town by town, block by block, and city by city.”“If we can do it in a place like Liberia, how is it that we couldn’t do it in Massachusetts?” added Mukherjee.In Africa and other parts of the world this type of work is considered one of the founding principles of public health.But, said Mukherjee, “for 40 years, the US has disinvested in public health and community health in favor of hospitals, and the sort of things that generate revenue.”In Wuhan, 1,800 teams of five people carried out this work, often voluntarily. Scaling that up to the US outbreak would mean 265,000 people are needed.Researchers at Johns Hopkins University suggested 100,000 to begin with “to assist with the enormous and unprecedented task of contact investigation and containment on this scale.”The country currently has, at most, only 5,000 specialists responsible for monitoring cases of communicable diseases such as HIV or tuberculosis, Michael Fraser, head of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) told AFP.He doesn’t expect recruiting to start before two to four weeks in most states.“Our goal is to get this in place for the reopening,” he said.It was not until Monday that the White House, through Vice President Mike Pence, announced the dispatch of reinforcements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to each state.In an email to AFP, the CDC said it had deployed 24 teams to each state, with over 600 staff nationwide.But states like Texas plan to start easing their lockdown orders over the coming days, reopening some shops and businesses.The Lone Star state, home to almost 30 million people, would need at least 8,000 contact tracers, estimates ASTHO.“There’s definitely going to be some risks” associated with lifting social distancing orders without having the right surveillance mechanisms in place, warned Fraser.That’s to say nothing of the need to ramp up contact tracing as more and more societal activities resume.In the absence of enough personnel, more at-risk groups like nursing homes, hospitals and vulnerable populations should be prioritized.When people get called in Massachusetts, the state has come to an agreement with telecoms operators to display “Covid Care Team” on the Caller ID, to try to maximize the number of people who pick up.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/no-benefit-higher-death-rate-for-malaria-drug-in-coronavirus-study/,but ‘it’s late’,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — A malaria drug widely touted as a potential cure for COVID-19 showed no benefit against the disease over standard care — and was in fact associated with more deaths, the biggest study of its kind showed Tuesday.The US government-funded analysis of how American military veterans fared on hydroxychloroquine was posted on a medical preprint site and has not yet been peer-reviewed.The experiment had several important limitations but adds to a growing body of doubt over the efficacy of the medicine that counts President Donald Trump and right-wing news channel Fox News among its biggest backers.Researchers looked at the medical records of 368 veterans hospitalized nationwide who either died or were discharged by April 11.Death rates for patients on hydroxychloroquine were 28 percent, compared to 22 percent when it was taken with the anti-biotic azithromycin — a combination favored by French scientist Didier Raoult, whose study on the subject in March triggered a surge of global interest in the drug.The death rate for those receiving only standard care was 11 percent.Hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, was more likely to be prescribed to patients with more severe illness, but the authors found that increased mortality persisted even after they statistically adjusted for higher rates of use.Other drawbacks include the fact that the study did not assign people randomly to groups, because it was a retrospective analysis meaning it looked back on what had already happened.In addition, the results are hard to generalize because the population was highly specific: most of the patients were male, with a median age over 65, and black, a group that is disproportionately affected by underlying illnesses like diabetes and heart disease.There was no added risk of being on a ventilator among the hydroxychloroquine only group, leading the authors to suggest that increased mortality among this group might be attributable to side-effects outside the respiratory system.Previous research has found that medicine is risky for patients with certain heart rhythm issues and can cause blackouts, seizures or at times cardiac arrest in this group.Hydroxychloroquine and related compound chloroquine have been used for decades to treat malaria, as well as the autoimmune disorders lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.They have received significant attention during the novel coronavirus pandemic and have been shown in lab settings to block the virus from entering cells and prevent it replicating — but in the pharmaceutical world, “in vitro” promise often fails to translate into “in vivo” success.The true answer can only be determined through very large, randomized clinical trials that assign patients to receive either the drug under investigation or a placebo.Several of these are underway, including notably in the United States, Europe, Canada and the United Kingdom.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/humans-to-blame-for-spread-of-coronavirus-and-other-zoonoses/,No benefit,1,", (AFP) — Whether it came from a bat or a pangolin is not certain, but one thing is: the coronavirus outbreak that has killed tens of thousands and turned the world upside down comes from the animal world.It is human activity enabled the virus to jump to people, and specialists are warning that if nothing changes many other pandemics of this nature will follow.The name given to diseases transmitted from animals to humans is “zoonoses”, based on the Greek words for “animal” and “sickness”.They are not new — tuberculosis, rabies, toxoplasmosis, malaria, to name just a few, are all zoonoses.According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), 60 percent of human infectious diseases originate from animals.This figure climbs to 75 percent for “emerging” diseases such as Ebola, HIV, avian flu, Zika, or SARS, another type of coronavirus. The list goes on.“The emergence of zoonotic diseases is often associated with environmental changes or ecological disturbances, such as agricultural intensification and human settlement, or encroachments into forests and other habitats,” said a 2016 UNEP report.“Changes in the environment are usually the result of human activities, ranging from land use change to climate change.”Gwenael Vourc’h of INRAE, a French public research institute, also blames human activity for the crossover between species.“Given the growth of the human population and its ever more intense use of planetary resources, the destruction of more and more ecosystems multiplies contacts,” she says.A key area of concern is deforestation to make way for agriculture and intensive livestock farming.Domesticated animals are often a “bridge” between pathogens from the wild and humans. The widespread use of antibiotics in the livestock industry has also led to bacterial pathogens building up immunity to front-line drugs.Urbanisation and habitat fragmentation are also highly disruptive of the balance between species, while global warming can push disease-carrying animals into new territory.The novel coronavirus is believed to have emerged in a wet market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.Scientists think it originated in bats and could have been passed on via another mammal like a pangolin, an endangered species whose meat and scales are highly prized in parts of Asia.But researchers have yet to come up with a definitive answer on how it migrated to people.The only sure thing is that human activity facilitated the jump.“The process that leads a microbe, such as a virus, from a population of vertebrates such as bats to humans is complex, but driven by people,” says Anne Larigauderie, executive secretary of IPBES, the panel of UN experts on biodiversity.“People, through their actions, create opportunities for the microbes to come closer to human populations.“The rate of global change in nature during the past 50 years is unprecedented in human history, and the most important direct driver of change in nature is land use change.”Beyond the current outbreak of coronavirus, IPBES estimates that zoonoses kill some 700,000 people a year.A study by American researchers published last week and completed before the new coronavirus outbreak identifies rodents, primates and bats as hosts of three-quarters of viruses transmitted to humans.But domestic animals also carry about 50 percent of the zoonoses identified.In terms of endangered wildlife, the study shows that those who share the most viruses with humans are precisely “populations declining due to exploitation and loss of habitat”.Christine Johnson, of the University of California veterinary school, who led the study, blames the human urge to “alter the landscape”.“This also increases the frequency and intensity of contact between humans and wildlife –- creating the perfect conditions for virus spillover,” she says.According to Larigauderie, this coronavirus outbreak may just be the tip of the iceberg.“Increased trends in land use change, combined with increased trends in trade, and global travels, are expected to increase the frequency of pandemics in future,” she says.“Transformative change is needed in order to find a solution to this global tragedy.”Vourc’h is also calling for a systemic response.“Beyond the essential response to each epidemic, we must think about our model… rethink our relationship with natural ecosystems and the services they provide,” she says.The 2016 UNEP report, which noted that “ecosystem integrity underlines human health and development”, said effective strategies already exist to control most neglected zoonoses. The main constraint, however, appeared to be “lack of investment”.At 86, Jane Goodall has spent most of her life studying and defending animals, especially chimpanzees in Africa, especially from Tanzania. And she pulls no punches on where she lays the blame.“It was predicted that this was going to happen and it’s going to happen again until we learn the lessons,” warns the British primatologist.“It is our disregard for nature and our disrespect of the animals we should share the planet with that has caused this pandemic.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/italy-mulls-psychological-tests-to-gauge-lockdown-impact/,higher death rate for malaria drug in coronavirus study,1,"ROME, Italy (AFP) — Italian scientists want the government to conduct psychological tests on a sample of the population to determine how long people can stay confined to their homes, a report said Monday.The Corriere della Sera newspaper said scientists want to understand how long Italians “are able to endure a lockdown” in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will announce a new set of social guidelines this week that could include the tests, the report said.Italy entered into a progressively more restrictive lockdown over the first half of March that has since been replicated by most European nations.The Mediterranean country’s 60 million citizens have been barred from walking more than 200 metres (650 feet) from their homes without a significant reason.Reports of domestic abuse have surged and scientists worry about the impact of such isolation on the elderly and the more vulnerable.Conte’s government is now debating how it can lift the stay-at-home order and reopen businesses while there is still no coronavirus cure or vaccine.The virus has officially killed 23,660 in Italy — second only to the United States — and probably many more because most care home deaths are not counted.Conte is expected to let people out of their homes for more reasons when the current lockdown rules expire on May 4.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/recovery-from-coronavirus-may-not-confer-immunity-warn-experts/,Italy mulls psychological tests to gauge lockdown impact,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Even as virologists zero in on the virus that causes COVID-19, a very basic question remains unanswered: do those who recover from the disease have immunity?There is no clear answer to this question, experts say, even if many have assumed that contracting the potentially deadly disease confers immunity, at least for a while.“Being immunized means that you have developed an immune response against a virus such that you can repulse it,” explained Eric Vivier, a professor of immunology in the public hospital system in Marseilles.“Our immune systems remember, which normally prevents you from being infected by the same virus later on.”For some viral diseases such the measles, overcoming the sickness confers immunity for life.But for RNA-based viruses such as Sars-Cov-2 — the scientific name for the bug that causes the COVID-19 disease — it takes about three weeks to build up a sufficient quantity of antibodies, and even then they may provide protection for only a few months, Vivier told AFP.At least that is the theory. In reality, the new coronavirus has thrown up one surprise after another, to the point where virologists and epidemiologists are sure of very little.“We do not have the answers to that — it’s an unknown,” Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s Emergencies Programme said in a press conference this week when asked how long a recovered COVID-19 patient would have immunity.“We would expect that to be a reasonable period of protection, but it is very difficult to say with a new virus — we can only extrapolate from other coronaviruses, and even that data is quite limited.”For SARS, which killed about 800 people across the world in 2002 and 2003, recovered patients remained protected “for about three years, on average,” Francois Balloux director of the Genetics Institute at University College London, told AFP.“One can certainly get reinfected, but after how much time? We’ll only know retroactively.”A recent study from China that has not gone through peer review reported on rhesus monkeys that recovered from Sars-Cov-2 and did not get reinfected when exposed once again to the virus.“But that doesn’t really reveal anything,” said Pasteur Institute researcher Frederic Tangy, noting that the experiment unfolded over only a month.Indeed,several cases from South Korea — one of the first countries hit by the new coronavirus — found that patients who recovered from COVID-19 later tested positive for the virus.But there are several ways to explain that outcome, scientists cautioned.While it is not impossible that these individuals became infected a second time, there is little evidence this is what happened.More likely, said Balloux, is that the virus never completely disappeared in the first place and remains — dormant and asymptomatic — as a “chronic infection”, like herpes.As tests for live virus and antibodies have not yet been perfected, it is also possible that these patients at some point tested “false negative” when in fact they had not rid themselves of the pathogen.“That suggests that people remain infected for a long time — several weeks,” Balloux added. “That is not ideal.”Another pre-publication study that looked at 175 recovered patients in Shanghai showed different concentrations of protective antibodies 10 to 15 days after the onset of symptoms.“But whether that antibody response actually means immunity is a separate question,” commented Maria Van Kerhove, Technical Lead of the WHO Emergencies Programme.“That’s something we really need to better understand — what does that antibody response look like in terms of immunity.”Indeed, a host of questions remain.“We are at the stage of asking whether someone who has overcome COVID-19 is really that protected,” said Jean-Francois Delfraissy, president of France’s official science advisory board.For Tangy, an even grimmer reality cannot be excluded.“It is possible that the antibodies that someone develops against the virus could actually increase the risk of the disease becoming worse,” he said, noting that the most serious symptoms come later, after the patient had formed antibodies.For the moment, it is also unclear whose antibodies are more potent in beating back the disease: someone who nearly died, or someone with only light symptoms or even no symptoms at all. And does age make a difference?Faced with all these uncertainties, some experts have doubts about the wisdom of persuing a “herd immunity” strategy such that the virus — unable to find new victims — peters out by itself when a majority of the population is immune.“The only real solution for now is a vaccine,” Archie Clements, a professor at Curtin University in Perth Australia, told AFP.At the same time, laboratories are developing a slew of antibody tests to see what proportion of the population in different countries and regions have been contaminated.Such an approach has been favored in Britain and Finland, while in Germany some experts have floated the idea of an “immunity passport” that would allow people to go back to work.“It’s too premature at this point,” said Saad Omer, a professor of infectious diseases at the Yale School of Medicine.“We should be able to get clearer data very quickly — in a couple of months — when there will be reliable antibody tests with sensitivity and specificity.”One concern is “false positives” caused by the tests detecting antibodies unrelated to COVID-19.The idea of immunity passports or certificates also raises ethical questions, researchers say.“People who absolutely need to work — to feed their families, for example — could try to get infected,” Balloux.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/new-york-woman-meets-baby-she-gave-birth-to-in-covid-19-coma/,New York woman meets baby she gave birth to in COVID-19 coma,1,", (AFP) — A woman in New York has met for the first time the baby she gave birth to in early April while she was on a ventilator in an artificial coma because she had a serious form of COVID-19.Yanira Soriano, 36, was intubated for 11 days in an intensive care unit before recovering “miraculously” to welcome her fourth child, her doctor told AFP.“We really did not know if she was going to survive at all,” said Benjamin Schwartz, head of obstetrics and gynecology at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore. “Most patients on a ventilator don’t survive.”But she finally turned a corner and was released from hospital in a wheelchair to the applause of dozens of health care workers on Wednesday. Her husband, who wore a mask like everyone else there, gently handed her their baby boy, Walter.Soriano was eight months pregnant when she became infected, around the same time as her husband, who had a less serious case and was able to remain at home.She was hospitalized and placed on oxygen but her condition quickly deteriorated.Doctors feared that a lack of oxygen might put the baby in danger, but also that the pressure from her large belly might prevent her lungs from functioning well.They just had time to tell her they wanted to perform an emergency cesarean section before she was placed in an artificial coma — with Soriano urging them to do whatever it took to save her baby.“The mother knew that that was happening, but then got really bad right before the section was performed and ended up on a ventilator, and not being awake to the birth of a child,” said Schwartz.The baby, who was only slightly premature, is doing well. He was transferred to a children’s hospital in New York, where he was picked up by his father on Tuesday.In some rare instances, babies born to mothers with COVID-19 tested positive themselves when they were checked shortly after birth — but this was not the case for little Walter, whose test came out clear.The pandemic has extracted an especially heavy toll in New York, where more than 11,000 have died statewide.The prognosis for patients who need to go on ventilators because their lungs are failing is poor, with only around 20 percent surviving the ordeal, according to the state’s governor.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/confusion-seizure-strokes-how-covid-19-may-affect-the-brain/,Confusion,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — A pattern is emerging among COVID-19 patients arriving at hospitals in New York: Beyond fever, cough and shortness of breath, some are deeply disoriented to the point of not knowing where they are or what year it is.At times this is linked to low oxygen levels in their blood, but in certain patients the confusion appears disproportionate to how their lungs are faring.Jennifer Frontera, a neurologist at NYU Langone Brooklyn hospital seeing these patients, told AFP the findings were raising concerns about the impact of the coronavirus on the brain and nervous system.By now, most people are familiar with the respiratory hallmarks of the COVID-19 disease that has infected more than 2.2 million people around the world.But more unusual signs are surfacing in new reports from the frontlines.A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last week found 36.4 percent of 214 Chinese patients had neurological symptoms ranging from loss of smell and nerve pain, to seizures and strokes.A paper in the New England Journal of Medicine this week examining 58 patients in Strasbourg, France found that more than half were confused or agitated, with brain imaging suggesting inflammation.“You’ve been hearing that this is a breathing problem, but it also affects what we most care about, the brain,” S Andrew Josephson, chair of the neurology department at the University of California, San Francisco told AFP.“If you become confused, if you’re having problems thinking, those are reasons to seek medical attention,” he added.“The old mantra of ‘Don’t come in unless you’re short of breath’ probably doesn’t apply anymore.” It isn’t completely surprising to scientists that SARS-CoV-2 might impact the brain and nervous system, since this has been documented in other viruses, including HIV, which can cause cognitive decline if untreated.Viruses affect the brain in one of two main ways, explained Michel Toledano, a neurologist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.One is by triggering an abnormal immune response known as a cytokine storm that causes inflammation of the brain — called autoimmune encephalitis.The second is direct infection of the brain, called viral encephalitis.How might this happen?The brain is protected by something called the blood-brain-barrier, which blocks foreign substances but could be breached if compromised.However, since loss of smell is a common symptom of the coronavirus, some have hypothesized the nose might be the pathway to the brain.This remains unproven — and the theory is somewhat undermined by the fact that many patients experiencing anosmia don’t go on to have severe neurological symptoms.In the case of the novel coronavirus, doctors believe based on the current evidence the neurological impacts are more likely the result of overactive immune response rather than brain invasion.To prove the latter even happens, the virus must be detected in cerebrospinal fluid.This has been documented once, in a 24-year-old Japanese man whose case was published in the International Journal of Infectious Disease.The man developed confusion and seizures, and imaging showed his brain was inflamed. But since this is the only known case so far, and the virus test hasn’t yet been validated for spinal fluid, scientists remain cautious. All of this emphasizes the need for more research.Frontera, who is also a professor at NYU School of Medicine, is part of an international collaborative research project to standardize data collection.Her team is documenting striking cases including seizures in COVID-19 patients with no prior history of the episodes, and “unique” new patterns of tiny brain hemorrhages.One startling finding concerns the case of a man in his fifties whose white matter — the parts of the brain that connect brain cells to each other — was so severely damaged it “would basically render him in a state of profound brain damage,” she said.The doctors are stumped and want to tap his spinal fluid for a sample.Brain imaging and spinal taps are difficult to perform on patients on ventilators, and since most die, the full extent of neurologic injury isn’t yet known.But neurologists are being called out for the minority of patients who survive being on a ventilator.“We’re seeing a lot of consults of patients presenting in confusional states,” Rohan Arora, a neurologist at the Long Island Jewish Forest Hills hospital told AFP, saying that describes more than 40 percent of recovered virus patients.It’s not yet known whether the impairment is long term, and being in the ICU itself can be a disorienting experience as a result of factors including strong medications.But returning to normal appears to be taking longer than for people who suffer heart failure or stroke, added Arora."

It is not available on the market and can only be manufactured and distributed at the request of the Japanese government.Favipiravir works by blocking the ability of a virus to replicate inside a cell.There are some safety concerns: it has been shown in animal studies to affect foetal development, meaning it is not given to pregnant women, and some doctors say they would not recommend it for children or adolescents. Some doctors began trying favipiravir to treat coronavirus patients early on, reasoning that its anti-viral properties would be applicable.Some initial results suggested the drug could help shorten recovery time for patients, with China’s ministry of science and technology hailing it as yielding “very good clinical results”.There are currently around five clinical trials ongoing in countries including the US, Italy and Japan, where Fujifilm announced it would be testing the drug’s efficacy on a group of 100 patients through until the end of June.The Japan study will involve administering the drug for up to 14 days to patients between 20 and 74 with mild pneumonia.Gaetan Burgio, a geneticist at Australian National University’s College of Health and Medicine, said the trials would be looking at a variety of factors.They include clinical outcomes — meaning effects on fever, cough, oxygenation, recovery time and time spent in hospital — as well as how quickly the virus clears the system, along with x-rays or CT scans for pneumonia.“If we see a significant reduction in clinical outcome and lower viral load from the favipiravir group, this would be a good sign for a larger-scale clinical trial,” he told AFP. While doctors have already been experimenting with favipiravir for treating coronavirus patients, these trials will be conducted according to rigorous guidelines intended to ensure the drug is safe and effective across a broad range of patients.“Smaller studies have been reported but it’s hard to draw conclusions from these as patient numbers are small and the trials often don’t compare versus (a regime of) best supportive care and placebo, more often to another drug,” said Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds.“The big trials should be segregated according to disease severity and will compare to placebo.” Scientists are studying a wide variety of drugs for possible treatment of coronavirus patients, including remdesivir, another antiviral.One study of the two drugs as a treatment for coronavirus found favipiravir was only effective at relatively high concentrations, with remdesivir considered a better option, possibly in part due to the way coronaviruses replicate compared to other viruses, said Griffin.But remdesivir is not yet licenced anywhere in the world and has to be administered intravenously via a drip, whereas favipiravir is approved in several countries and can be taken orally as a pill.Japan has heavily backed the drug, asking Fujifilm to ramp up production for use at home and offering to supply it for free to dozens of countries that have put in requests. Fujifilm’s Japan and US trials will run until the end of June, with other data coming in from trials in Italy and elsewhere. Additional information will also be available from so-called compassionate use of the drug by doctors offering it to patients in non-study settings where other medication is not working.But Burgio cautioned against high hopes.“There are to date over 300 clinical trials underway for COVID-19. The expectations are very high for a miracle drug!”“Let’s wait and see. However, rather than drugs, the best treatment against COVID-19 for now is social isolation, wash our hands and stay at home.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/paper-towels-may-remove-virus-missed-by-poor-hand-washing-study/,Japan viral comedy song swaps ‘Pineapple-pen’ for handwashing advice,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — People should dry their hands with paper towels to avoid spreading the new coronavirus, according to the authors of a study published on Friday that finds disposable tissues are better than jet dryers at removing pathogens missed by ineffective washing.Global health authorities have highlighted the crucial importance of washing hands with soap and water to protect against COVID-19, which has killed tens of thousands and spread around the world.Contaminated hands are a major route for germ transmission, potentially spreading pathogens to surfaces — like door handles or taps — and causing infection when people touch their faces.A small study by experts from Britain’s University of Leeds and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust found that if hands had not been properly washed, drying with a paper towel was more effective at removing microbes. “We believe that our results are relevant to the control of the novel coronavirus that is spreading at pace worldwide,” said the authors, led by Ines Moura from the University of Leeds.“Paper towels should be the preferred way to dry hands after washing and so reduce the risk of virus contamination and spread.”Four volunteers had their hands contaminated using a bacteriophage — a virus that infects bacteria and is harmless to humans — and then did not attempt to wash the microbes away.They then dried their hands either with paper towels or a jet air dryer in a hospital toilet and went on to touch various surfaces including door handles, stair rails, phones and stethoscopes.Researchers found that using both paper towels and jet dryers reduced the contamination on hands. But for 10 out of 11 surfaces sampled, the jet method left “significantly greater environmental contamination”.Microbes were found on all surfaces touched after using the jet dryer, with contamination on average 10 times higher than after the use of paper towels.The authors said the study was particularly relevant for hospital settings.They noted that while the NHS and World Health Organisation (WHO) recommend the use of disposable towels after hand-washing — as well as using them to turn off taps — healthcare facilities in the UK were increasingly using jet dryers.“Clearly how much virus remains on peoples’ hands after washing depends to a large extent on how efficiently people are at washing their own hands,” said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, in response to the research.“If people do not wash their hands properly then other people may be at risk if standing close to someone using such a jet dryer. This study reinforces the need to wash hands properly so as much virus is removed as possible before drying.”The study was due to be presented at this year’s European Congress on Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) in Paris this month, which was itself cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/french-philosopher-bernard-henri-levy-warns-of-virus-exploitation/,Paper towels may remove virus missed by poor hand washing: study,1,"by Dave CLARK Agence France-Presse, (AFP) — Prominent French intellectual, Bernard-Henri Levy, argues that the coronavirus epidemic is not an unprecedented health threat but that the way societies are responding is both new and dangerous.In an AFP interview, the 71-year-old philosopher and writer said the so-called and the were similar in scale to the current deadly global situation.But, whereas those epidemics had little political impact at the time and were quickly forgotten, today’s crisis has touched humanity’s collective conscience and been seized upon by some to push their own harmful agendas.“There are two reasons for this. One is a good reason, the other is an unfortunate reason,” said Levy, who will address Franco-British think-tank The Hexagon Society’s “REPOST!” online forum on Thursday to raise virus funds.“We’ve made progress in civilisation. We’re in a world today when life comes first and life has become sacred, which it wasn’t 50 or 60 years ago. And this is beautiful. This idea that life is sacred, it’s extraordinary progress.“On the other hand, what’s less fortunate is that I believe the information system, as it works today, with its own virality, helps to bring hysteria to the perception of things and the debate.”Levy, who came to prominence as a philosopher in the 1970s, has lost friends of his own to the latest virus and stresses it is important that public health advice be shared.He warns, however, that an approach that profiles the epidemic as an attack from the outside is ripe for exploitation.Having studied the Parisian press and public archives from the time of the last similar epidemic, he said: “In ’68 and ’69 the idea was that the virus was something horrible, but it was part of the human condition.“It wasn’t an outside agent, manipulated by foreign powers and injected into a healthy humanity … What is the metaphor of ‘fighting a war’ if not that? It is saying that there’s a foreign enemy which we must eradicate.”Several western leaders such as US president Donald Trump, who is battling an “invisible enemy”, and — initially — France’s Emmanuel Macron have compared the battle against the coronavirus to a war.But for BHL this opens up space for leaders like Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban to exploit the crisis to pursue an authoritarian agenda — and for others to misuse public concern to pursue other causes.And he rejects attempts to set up a debate between proponents of authoritarian public health tactics such as enforced lockdowns and enhanced surveillance and supposedly less effective democratic methods.“For me, on this point, there’s not even a debate. For Viktor Orban, in Hungary, to seize upon the virus to impose a reduction in civic rights is quite simply disgusting,” BHL declared.“But there’s one thing today that strikes me as very worrying on the behalf of all these people — from whatever political camp — instrumentalising this virus. Giving it a meaning. Taking it up to advance a cause.”In this “detestable” group are not only authoritarian leaders, but those who see the virus as nature’s revenge for environmental harm or a rejection of open borders or the global free-trading system.“But no! A virus is stupid. I virus is dumb. It is not sending a message. I think we should resist all of that,” said Levy.“On the one side you’ve got your standard conspiracy theorists, the cretins, who think it was built in a lab. But you also have the more sophisticated conspiracy mongers, who tell you the virus has a plan, brings a message.“It’s very important to say to these people: A virus is not a message. It has no intelligence. It is blind.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/covid-19-to-have-profound-mental-health-fallout/,Free wi-fi installed at quarantine centers for frontliners,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — The coronavirus pandemic is likely to have a “profound and pervasive impact” on global mental health as billions struggle to cope with isolated living and anxiety spikes, experts warned Thursday.In a paper published in Lancet Psychiatry, a panel of 24 specialists call for more funding for research into the impacts COVID-19 may have on society’s mental well-being.Two accompanying surveys of the British public showed that most people questioned had experienced heightened anxiety and fear of becoming mentally unwell since the pandemic struck.“We are all dealing with unprecedented uncertainty and major changes to the way we live our lives as a result of coronavirus,” said lead author Emily Holmes from Uppsala University’s department of psychology.“Our surveys show these changes are already having a considerable impact on our mental health.”The authors called for real-time monitoring of anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide across the world, as well as the creation of treatment programs that can be accessed remotely.“This needs to be on a bigger scale than we have ever seen previously, and must be coordinated, targeted and comprehensive,” said Matthew Hotopf, from King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience.“Above all, we want to stress that all new interventions must be informed by top notch research to make sure they work.”Studies into the mental health impact of previous disease outbreaks, such as the SARS epidemic in the early 2000s, showed a clear increase in suicide rates and the number of health care workers who experience emotional distress.But the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic is unprecedented, with billions of people forced to isolate at home and no end in sight even after social distancing measures are eased.The surveys, conducted among more than 3,000 people in Britain, showed a wide range of fears arising from the pandemic.These include increased anxiety, the effects of social isolation, the fear of becoming mentally unwell and accessing care if needed.The experts cautioned that these symptoms were likely to continue well in to the future, even after the current round of lockdowns are eased.The authors called for government funding to establish specialized working groups comprised of people with experience of mental health impacts to ensure research and treatment are prioritized.“Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and an economic downturn are a perfect storm to harm people’s mental health and wellbeing,” said Rory O’Connor, professor of Health Psychology at the University of Glasgow.He said that a lack of intervention risked an explosion of mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, as well as a rise in alcohol and drug addiction.“The scale of this problem is too serious to ignore, both in terms of every human life that may be affected, and in terms of the wider impact on society.”© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/how-false-negatives-are-complicating-covid-19-testing/,warns of virus exploitation,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — As COVID-19 tests become more widely available across the US, scientists have warned about a growing concern: Many people with negative results might actually have the virus.That could have devastating implications as a global recession looms and governments wrangle with the question of when to reopen economies shuttered as billions of people were ordered to stay home in an effort to break transmission of the deadly disease.The majority of tests around the world use a technology called PCR, which detects pieces of the coronavirus in mucus samples.But “there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,” Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.“It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,” she said.The virus has only been spreading among humans for four months and therefore studies about test reliability are still considered preliminary.Early reports from China suggest its sensitivity, meaning how well it is able to return positive results when the virus is present, is somewhere around 60 to 70 percent.Different companies around the world are now producing slightly different tests, so it’s hard to have a precise overall figure.But even if it were possible to increase the sensitivity to 90 percent, the magnitude of risk remains substantial as the number of people tested grows, Sampathkumar argued in a paper published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings.“In California, estimates say the rate of COVID-19 infection may exceed 50 percent by mid-May 2020,” she said.With 40 million people, “even if only one percent of the population was tested, 20,000 false-negative results would be expected.”This makes it critical for clinicians to base their diagnosis on more than just the test: they must also examine a patient’s symptoms, their potential exposure history, imaging and other lab work. Part of the problem lies in locating the virus as its area of highest concentration shifts within the body.The main nasal swab tests examine the nasopharynx, where the back of the nose meets the top of the throat. This requires a trained hand to perform and some portion of the false negatives arises from improper procedure.But even if done correctly, the swab may produce a false negative. That’s because as the disease progresses, the virus passes from the upper to the lower respiratory system.In these cases, the patient may be asked to try to cough up sputum — mucus from the lower lungs — or doctors may need to take a sample more invasively, when a patient is under sedation.Daniel Brenner, an emergency physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, described to AFP taking a test after performing a procedure called a bronchoalveolar lavage.This was done on a patient whose nasal swab returned negative three times, but who showed all the signs of COVID-19.Eventually, the patient’s medical team placed a camera down his windpipe to examine the lungs, then sprayed fluid in and sucked out the secretions, which were then tested, resulting in a positive. Uncertainty in clinical diagnoses is not new, and clinicians are well aware that no type of test for any condition can be considered perfect.What makes COVID-19 different is its newness, said Sampathkumar.“Most of the time when you have tests, you have test characteristics outlined carefully and warnings about tests interpretation,” she said.“We had no test for so long, and when we got the test, we started using it widely and sort of forgot the basics.”After being slow to start mass testing, the US has ramped up production and has tested almost 2.5 million people, with pharmacists now authorized to carry out the procedure.But “the real fear of that is people who are given a false negative test and then decide that they’re safe to go around their daily life and go out and expose people,” said Brenner.Much hope is placed on newly available serological tests which look for antibodies produced by a person’s body in response to the virus and can tell whether a person was infected, long after they recovered.They could also be used to help diagnose a person who is currently infected but whose PCR test results showed a false negative, by waiting a week or so for the body to produce its immune response.“We are excited about the serologic test, but we don’t know how well it will work and we are starting to study it,” said Sampathkumar. ©"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/coronavirus-found-in-air-samples-up-to-13-feet-from-patients/,COVID-19 to have ‘profound’ mental health fallout,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — A new study examining air samples from hospital wards with COVID-19 patients has found the virus can travel up to 13 feet (four meters) — twice the distance current guidelines say people should leave between themselves in public.The preliminary results of the investigation by Chinese researchers were published Friday in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a journal of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).They add to a growing debate on how the disease is transmitted, with the scientists themselves cautioning that the small quantities of virus they found at this distance are not necessarily infectious.The researchers, led by a team at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing, tested surface and air samples from an intensive care unit and a general COVID-19 ward at Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan. They housed a total of 24 patients between February 19 and March 2.They found that the virus was most heavily concentrated on the floors of the wards, “perhaps because of gravity and air flow causing most virus droplets to float to the ground.”High levels were also found on frequently touched surfaces like computer mice, trashcans, bed rails and door knobs.“Furthermore, half of the samples from the soles of the ICU medical staff shoes tested positive,” the team wrote. “Therefore, the soles of medical staff shoes might function as carriers.” The team also looked at so-called aerosol transmission — when the droplets of the virus are so fine they become suspended and remain airborne for several hours, unlike cough or sneeze droplets that fall to the ground within seconds.They found that virus-laden aerosols were mainly concentrated near and downstream from patients at up to 13 feet — though smaller quantities were found upstream, up to eight feet.Encouragingly, no members of the hospital staff were infected, “indicating that appropriate precautions could effectively prevent infection,” the authors wrote.They also offered advice that bucks orthodox guidelines: “Our findings suggest that home isolation of persons with suspected COVID-19 might not be a good control strategy” given the levels of environmental contamination.Aerosolization of the coronavirus is a contentious area for scientists who study it, because it is not clear how infectious the disease is in the tiny quantities found in ultrafine mist.The World Health Organization has so far downplayed the risk.US health authorities have adopted a more cautious line and urged people to cover their faces when out in public in case the virus can be transmitted through normal breathing and speaking."

She is feisty! But something I’m thankful to God for is, at her age, she’s healthy. She has no maintenance medication whatsoever. All she needs is to have an apple every morning with her cup of coffee.Mom Elvie or “Guama Elvie” as my nieces and nephews call her — loves to cook and bake her signature banana bread. She moves around the house all day.Even when she watches TV — she does simple stretches and exercises.In between TV shows, she takes care of her mini-indoor garden. She just wouldn’t stay stillNo one can tell her to not do anything.Because she will find a way… I like seeing her active and strong. That’s how I know she’s not sick — or feeling under the weather. To this day — she’s running the house!On weekends or whenever i get the chance – we will go for a ride – just for her to get some fresh air. That’s also our mother and daughter bondingThese days, however, everything is uncertain because we don’t know what lies ahead of this public health emergency.When the COVID-19 pandemic happened, I made sure mom understood a lot of things will change at home. First of all, because of her age, she is considered at a higher risk to contract the virus. So she’s not allowed to go out for the time being.But for me? I still have to work and run errands.I explained to her that whenever I am home — we both have to wear masks and keep our distance — at least six feet away from each other! This means we have to eat separately— watch TV separately, talk to each other from a distance. Pretty much do things in different rooms in the house.If I see her in the kitchen, I let her finish what she’s doing before i can even proceed to do something for myself. At times she forgets and so I will remind her.We have to change our usual mother-daughter rituals of hellos and goodbyes.Everyday, when I leave her, and every time I come home, there is something amiss. I miss hugging and kissing her. I miss the tap on the back that we give each other whenever we hug. I miss holding her and bugging her. She’s so close yet so far. And no matter how much I’d like to hold her, I have to stop and remind myself, that it’s not healthy to do that right now.Staying away from her is for the best right now. Our lives changed dramatically because of COVID-19.I need not go out to see the change. It’s right in front of me.My mom and I are somewhat like strangers in our home.Look around you what do you see? How are you affected? How is your family affected?Whether we like it or not, we have a responsibility to make sure our parents, our children, our friends are safe. And no matter how inconvenient social or physical distancing is, we have to observe it. Because we love them.More than likely, it will take a while before our lives return to normal.For now, we need to sacrifice and endure to make sure that we and our loved ones are safe and protected.Amidst all this, I will not lose hope. I will stay positive. I will keep the faith.And praying every moment I get, makes everything bearable."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/coronavirus-was-spreading-in-nyc-in-february-came-via-europe/,Coronavirus was spreading in NYC in February,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The novel coronavirus began spreading in New York City in February, before widespread testing began, and the strain so far identified in local samples came from Europe, a scientist said Wednesday.Adriana Heguy, a geneticist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine who led the research, told AFP that tracing back the virus’ chain of transmission will help policy makers make better informed social interventions in the future.“It’s very interesting that so far, the majority seem to be coming from Europe, and this is in part I think because there was a focus on stopping travel from China,” she said.The findings also tie in with a spate of mysterious pneumonia cases that New York physicians were treating before large scale testing began in the city, she added.Heguy and her team determined the viral sequences of 75 samples taken from the nasal swabs of patients at Tisch Hospital, NYU Winthrop Hospital and NYU Langone Hospital Brooklyn.All organisms mutate over time, but so-called RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 introduce errors in each cycle of their replication.This is the reason why influenza viruses are so different from season to season and require new vaccines.While the new coronavirus doesn’t seem to mutate as fast as the flu, there are enough changes for scientists to trace back its ancestry, much like a person’s DNA can be traced back to their parents and grandparents.To do this, the New York team uploaded the samples they had taken to a server run by the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID EpiFlu) where scientists from around the world share data.The first patient they studied had no relevant travel history, meaning he had been infected by someone in their community.“By the specific changes that had occurred in his virus, we could tell basically, with a high degree of probability that it was coming from England,” said Heguy.Beyond determining transmission pathways, there could be clinical implications in continuing to gather more data.For example, scientists will eventually seek to learn whether some strains lead to less or more serious forms of the disease than others, and this could inform targeted treatments.Another potential use will come as countries go back to work and lift lockdown restrictions — as China and South Korea are starting to do.If, as scientists suspect, the virus is seasonal and returns in a smaller second wave, they can immediately sequence its genome from infected patients, then take samples from the neighborhood where they live to determine if there is a community outbreak.This in turn can help more targeted social interventions.The team is in the early stages of their project but hopes to soon sequence nearly 200 samples per week with the goal of offering thousands of genomes for analysis.© Agence France-Press"

Records of encounter will then be stored in the users’ phones.“If one app user tested positive for Covid-19, authorities will be able to identify other app users who were in close contact with the patient”, the DICT’s statement said.The statement added that DICT Secretary Gregorio Honasan has written to Singaporean Ambassador Gerard Ho Wei Hong to request more details and information about the app.“In response, Ambassador Ho Wei Hong said Singapore is willing to provide technical assistance to DICT regarding the matter”, the statement added."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/world-short-of-six-million-nurses-who-says/,SG-based app eyed as potential tool in contact tracing of COVID-19 patients,1,"As COVID-19 captures global headlines, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned Tuesday that the world needs nearly six million nurses.The UN’s health agency along with partners Nursing Now and the International Council of Nurses (ICN) underscored in a report the crucial role played by nurses, who make up more than half of all health workers worldwide.“Nurses are the backbone of any health system,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.“Today, many nurses find themselves on the frontline in the battle against COVID-19,” he noted, adding that it was vital they “get the support they need to keep the world healthy.”The report said that there are just under 28 million nurses on the planet.In the five years leading up to 2018, the number grew by 4.7 million.“But this still leaves a global shortfall of 5.9 million,” the WHO said, pointing out that the greatest gaps were in poorer countries in Africa, southeast Asia, the Middle East and parts of South America.The report urged countries to identify gaps in their nursing workforce and invest in nursing education, jobs and leadership. ICN chief executive Howard Catton told a virtual briefing that infection rates, medication errors and mortality rates “are all higher where there are too few nurses”.Furthermore, “shortages exhaust our current nursing workforce”, he added.In fighting the pandemic, Mary Watkins, who co-chaired the report for Nursing Now, called for urgent investment in virus tests for healthcare workers.“We have a very high proportion of healthcare workers not going to work because they’re afraid that they’ve been infected and that they can’t prove that they have not got the infection — or that they’ve had it, and they’re over it,” she said.Catton said that 23 nurses had died in Italy and cited figures suggesting that around 100 health workers had died around the world.Meanwhile he said there were reports of nine percent of health workers being infected in Italy and “we’re now hearing of rates of infections up to 14 percent in Spain”.He also cited reports of “completely unacceptable and reprehensible” attacks on health workers battling COVID-19, largely due to ignorance about their work, combined with countries not doing enough to protect them.“COVID is putting it into a very stark lens for us all,” he said, though he welcomed the growing appreciation in some countries of nurse’s work.Catton said that could help change perceptions of the value of nursing — which in turn might help make it a more attractive profession. Beyond COVID-19, Watkins said many wealthier countries were not producing enough nurses to meet their own healthcare needs, and were therefore reliant on migration, exacerbating shortages in poorer countries.“Eighty percent of the world’s nurses only currently serve 50 percent of the world’s population,” she noted.Catton warned of risks that richer countries would rely on the Philippines and India to “supply the world with nurses”, which could lead to significant shortages in India.The experts said nursing remains female-dominated and needed to recruit more men.“There is clear evidence that where there are more men in any profession in the world, the pay and the terms and conditions improve,” Watkins said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/bronx-zoo-tiger-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/,World short of six million nurses,1,"NEW YORK, United States (AFP) — A tiger at New York’s Bronx Zoo has tested positive for COVID-19, the institution said Sunday, and is believed to have contracted the virus from a caretaker who was asymptomatic at the time.The four-year-old Malayan tiger named Nadia along with her sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions all developed dry coughs and are expected to fully recover, the Wildlife Conservation Society that runs the city’s zoos said in a statement.“We tested the cat out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about COVID-19 will contribute to the world’s continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus,” the statement sent to AFP said.“Though they have experienced some decrease in appetite, the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers,” the statement continued.“It is not known how this disease will develop in big cats since different species can react differently to novel infections, but we will continue to monitor them closely and anticipate full recoveries.”All four of the zoos and the aquarium in New York — whose virus death toll has topped 4,000 — have been closed since March 16.The zoo emphasized that there is “no evidence that animals play a role in the transmission of COVID-19 to people other than the initial event in the Wuhan market, and no evidence that any person has been infected with COVID-19 in the US by animals, including by pet dogs or cats.”Chinese disease control officials had identified wild animals sold in a Wuhan market as the source of the coronavirus pandemic that has infected well over one million people worldwide.According to the US Department of Agriculture website there had “not been reports of pets or other animals” in the United States falling ill with coronavirus prior to news of the tiger Nadia.“It is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus,” the department’s website says.In late March a pet cat was discovered infected with the novel coronavirus in Belgium, following similar cases in Hong Kong where two dogs tested positive for COVID-19.All of those animals are believed to have contracted the virus from the people they live with.The Bronx zoo said preventative measures were in place for caretakers as well as all cats in the city’s zoos."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/after-the-virus-what-world-will-we-live-in/,WHO says,1,"One day, the battle against the novel coronavirus will be won. But the world that emerges may look very different from the one we lived in before the pandemic began.Over 60,000 people have lost their lives to COVID-19 and there are a more than a million confirmed cases with the outbreak yet to reach its peak across the developed and emerging world.But on top of the tragic human toll, the coronavirus also threatens incalculable social, economic and political costs, and to trigger a wave of change that will shape our world for years to come.The shutdown imposed to slow the spread of the virus could push some economies into full-scale meltdown. Financial markets may never recover to pre-crisis levels.Restrictions on movement will help some governments tighten autocratic control, and civil liberties could be eroded in the name of gaining information on virus spread.Many are already questioning the merit of multilateral organisations such as the WHO or the United Nations given the perceived lack of a coordinated, global response to an unprecedented health crisis.The changes could be immense, say analysts, but also unpredictable. “Is it going to be a headline or is it a trendline?” asked Aaron David Miller, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.“Are we witnessing an event that is going to reshape international relations and relations among states?”Much will depend on how long national economies manage to withstand the storm, and the performance of governments in tackling the threat.China, where the virus is believed to have originated, proudly claims to have quelled the outbreak.US President Donald Trump initially appeared to shrug off the seriousness of the threat and is now faced with a full-scale crisis.While the official figures from India remain far less grim than in the West, there is anxiety that much worse is to come.“Is this leadership or absence of leadership going to provide opportunities or vulnerabilities to various countries around the world?” asked Miller. The world’s wealthiest powers enjoy a cushion that will allow them to keep the economy ticking over during the crisis, to compensate workers laid off, and to resume economic activity quickly afterwards.But in poorer countries with no such protections, the resulting deprivation risks driving people onto the street.“The potential for widespread social unrest in countries that have not provided a social safety net for those losing their jobs during this crisis strikes me as very real, with possible repercussions for governance and more,” said Joshua Geltzer, visiting professor of law at Georgetown University.Countries like Russia and Turkey, led by the same strongmen for two decades, will be hoping that their measures will be enough to spare them the worst of the virus and any political consequences.But to battle the outbreak, even the most democratic societies have had to restrict civil liberties on an unprecedented scale and bid farewell to border-free travel for the foreseeable future.“All the global elite who had lectured for a long time about liberalism and globalisation were the first to close their borders,” pointed out Bakary Sambe, director of the Timbuktu Institute in Dakar.Pratap Bhanu Mehta, professor of political sciences at India’s Ashoka University, said there risked being conflicts over trading systems.“There is a potential to accelerate deglobalisation in the wake of the crisis.” The European Union, in a year that it wanted to show solidity after Brexit, has been sorely tested.States adopted policies unilaterally, there have been vast discrepancies in preparedness, and one member, Hungary, adopted policies which critics say border on authoritarianism.The EU is far from the only international institution to feel the heat.The G20, chaired this year by Saudi Arabia, has struggled to make itself heard. And the observers say the UN, through its World Health Organisation (WHO), has yet to coordinate a truly global outbreak response.The WHO “seems more and more sidelined,” said Barthelemy Courmont, researcher at the Institute for International and Strategic Research (IRIS) in Paris.“What legitimacy will we grant to international institutions if they do not have the authority to manage crises? The global system we live in will emerge somewhat weakened from this crisis.”"

The fact that the robots can’t get infected is a great achievement.”The readings from the machines allows medics to stay out of the intensive care units and monitor patients’ vital signs on computer screens in separate rooms.Italy’s death toll, the worst globally, has reached 14,681 and is on course to top 15,000 this weekend.Doctors doubt the official figures and think the real number of dead may be twice as high in Varese’s Lombardy region.Italy is expected to remain under a general lockdown at least through the end month."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/untouchable-the-baby-born-to-a-mom-with-coronavirus/,After the virus: What world will we live in?,1,", (AFP) — For 10 days after giving birth to her first child, the mother was not allowed near him after she tested positive for coronavirus, for fear of infecting her newborn.And even though she has since been reunited with her son, neither she nor her husband have been allowed to physically touch him without gloves as they undergo an extended period of quarantine.“It’s hard,” says Vanesa Muro at her home in Madrid, the worst-hit area in Spain, a country where more than 10,000 people have died from the virus, the highest number outside Italy.“He grabs your finger, the poor little thing and holds on to the plastic, not on to you. But at least that’s another day over, you have to think of it like that otherwise you get depressed,” says the 34-year-old.She had been preparing to have the baby by caesarian section on March 16, but everything changed when her grandmother, who the couple had been seeing every day, caught the virus. She later died.On March 12, she and her husband tested positive and he rushed her to Madrid’s La Paz University Hospital but he was not allowed in, “so he left me at A&E”, she told AFP.They decided to operate the next day.“I felt a whole mixture of feelings, it was horrible,” she says — fear of infecting the baby, nervous about going through it without her husband, and the bizarre sense of being operated on by surgeons completely covered in protective suits.Back home, her husband was also struggling, knowing she was in surgery but not knowing what was going on.“It was the longest 90 minutes of my life,” says Oscar Carrillo.In the end, baby Oliver was born safely, weighing 3.6 kilogrammes (7 pounds, 9 ounces).He was put straight into an incubator and kept away from all the other babies until he was tested and found to be free of the virus.Following 48 hours recovering in hospital in almost total isolation, with the staff entering the room as little as possible because of a lack of protective equipment, Muro was allowed to go home, but had to leave her baby behind.“It seems silly but even though he was seven floors below me, he seemed closer to me there than when I was home,” she says.It was only 10 days later that the couple, wearing gloves and masks, were allowed to take him home.“Hey little champion, we’re going to go home now,” were the first words Muro said to her son during their emotional reunion.“It was like he’d just been born that day.”For Arantxa Fernandez, a psychologist at the hospital, it was also a very special moment, “the most beautiful I’ve ever experienced in my professional life,” she told AFP.Throughout the process, Fernandez would send the couple photos and videos of Oliver while he was still in hospital, offering the pair support that they describe as “vital”.Although they have spent 14 days in quarantine, there are no testing kits to confirm they are free from the virus so they are still wearing gloves and masks.“I still haven’t touched my son without gloves… we are just dying for the quarantine to end so we can touch him, kiss him,” says Carrillo as his wife gives Oliver a bottle, safety measures in place.And the new parents are not able to turn to their families for support.Even though Muro’s parents live very close, Spain’s lockdown means it feels like they are living miles away, Carrillo says.“It’s hard but we’ll get through it,” says Muro.“In no time, he’ll be a month old and we’ll be back out on the streets.“He will get to know his grandparents and aunts and uncles. And all of this will just be a memory of a nightmare that we lived through.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/superheroes-coronavirus-survivors-donate-plasma-hoping-to-heal-the-sick/,Italy’s doctors look for help from sleek new robots,1,", (AFP) — As she emerges from quarantine, recovered COVID-19 patient Diana Berrent is eager to join the battle against the pandemic and donate precious antibodies that researchers hope might help others.In mid-March, the New Yorker woke up with a 102-degree (39 Celsius) fever and intense chest heaviness, becoming one of the first from her Long Island neighbourhood to test positive for coronavirus.This week, Berrent was the first survivor in her state screened for antibodies — immune system-generated proteins that can ward off viruses — to contribute to initial tests seeking treatment for the infection that’s left more than 51,000 people dead worldwide.Convalescent plasma, the fluid in blood teeming with antibodies post-illness, has proven effective in small studies to treat infectious diseases including Ebola and SARS.Now, the US Food and Drug Administration has greenlit physicians to experiment with the strategy as coronavirus patients fill hospitals and the nation’s positive caseload spikes to over 236,000.Bruce Sachias, chief medical officer of the New York Blood Center — which will collect, test and distribute donations in the city — said while there is reason to believe plasma transfusions can help alleviate the current crisis, tests underway are not intended to yield golden-ticket solutions.“It’s really important for us to be very cognisant of the fact that we’re still in very new territory,” he said.Eldad Hod and Steven Spitalnik — transfusion medicine doctors leading trials at Columbia University’s Irving Medical Center — are cautiously optimistic but, like Sachias, emphasize the unknowns.Spitalnik told AFP they believe “within seven to 14 days after the onset of an infection, that people will develop an immune response and eventually make high amounts of antibodies — although exactly when the peak of antibody production will be, we don’t know.”He said some data suggests antibody production could peak around 28 days post-infection, and hopes the new research could provide a clearer picture.Hod said each donation “can potentially save three to four lives.”The primary goal now is acquiring a significant plasma stock, so researchers can conduct formal studies with control groups who would receive non-convalescent plasma, and others the antibody-packed donations.Initial plasma, however, will be distributed for “compassionate use,” Hod said — to patients outside studies but for whom other strategies have failed.They also aim to test treatments on already-hospitalized patients and as a preventative therapy in settings like nursing homes.Spitalnik said that normally they would want “highly controlled” clinical trials, which take longer but are more definitive.But “this is a crisis,” he said.“We understand and we are amenable to doing things that will take shorter amounts of time — but hopefully we’ll yield at least some rigorous results.”Berrent is eager to open her personal blood bank and crossing her fingers in hope the process can prove life-saving.“We can be superheroes,” the 45-year-old photographer told AFP.“These are unprecedented, frightening times where everything is beyond our control — except for we as survivors can help,” Berrent said.“We can be the ones running towards the fire in our own internally built hazmat suit. And that is a tremendous opportunity — how could you not take advantage of that?”Berrent’s antibody levels met donation requirements — but she is waiting on results of a nasal swab test to make sure any remnants of coronavirus have dissipated.In the meantime, she’s started the more than 17,000-member Facebook group “Survivor Corps” to mobilize other survivors to share their immunity.“I can’t wait to donate,” Berrent said. “We need a forward-looking solution-based approach that offers hope because things are very, very bleak right now.”A Houston hospital has already transfused plasma from a recovered patient into someone critically ill, though it’s still too early to determine efficacy.Sachias said hundreds of people who believe they have recovered from COVID-19 have applied to help in New York, the US epicenter of the highly contagious virus that accounts for nearly half of related deaths stateside.As their research gets underway, Hod said one silver lining of coronavirus’ global scale has been the boost to collaborative scientific efforts, saying data is being shared more openly than ever before.“I think a lot of the scientific community has tried to put their egos aside… and banded together to try and work together for the common good,” he said.“And I think in the end, science will win.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/antibody-tests-key-to-ending-covid-19-lockdowns/,Untouchable: the baby born to a mom with coronavirus,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — It’s the key that opens to door from total lockdown: serologic testing, which will show definitively who has contracted COVID-19 and is in theory safe to return to work.“Everyone’s waiting for serologic testing, the whole world,” said France’s Health Minister Olivier Veran.He said that the global research community was focussing on ways of perfecting the tests, which measure viral antibodies in a person’s blood that signal immunity.Veran said that mass production of the tests could start within weeks.“It’s a huge factor, especially when we’re trying to reduce confinement,” he said.The World Health Organization said that serologic tests were still being developed but were yet to be properly evaluated.Current diagnostic tests, known as RT-PCR, are invasive and use genetic analysis to see if a person is actively infected.Serologic testing, which only requires a drop of blood to conduct, focuses instead on finding virus antibodies, the presence of which indicates that an individual has had COVID-19 and is now likely immune.“Antibodies are one of the key immune response components. They start to be detectable around a week after initial infection,” said Andrew Preston, a reader in Microbial Pathogenesis at the University of Bath.There are two types of antibodies associated with the COVID-19 immune response: IgM, which the body produces in the early stages of viral response, and IgG, which arrive later on during infection.The tests being developed can identify both antibodies, key hallmarks of a patient’s auto-immune response to the virus.“Thus there is great interest in the use of an antibody test to indicate immunity against disease for use in the lifting of lockdown restrictions,” said Preston.Antibody testing is so crucial because of the large proportion of people with COVID-19 infections who may not show symptoms but can still pass the virus on to others.Such tests already exist for other illnesses. And once they are perfected for the novel coronavirus the results can be analyzed in labs using existing hardware.Once widely available, they could be used to determine who gets to return to work and exit the lockdown currently being experienced by billions around the world.“The main question is how to ensure everyone can return to work,” Francois Blanchecotte, president of the French Union of Biologists, told AFP.In Italy, the president of the Venice region Luca Zaia, has proposed that returning workers carry a document after testing to prove they aren’t contagious.Similar measures have been proposed in Germany.“A GP told me yesterday that if I gave him a serologic test and it showed that he’s immune, he would offer his services to a neighboring hospital’s COVID-19 unit in a flash,” said Philippe Herent, director of the Synlab Opale group of laboratories.He, however, cautioned that global demand for the tests is likely to significantly outstrip demand, and production remains limited.The tests aren’t the perfect solution, however.“They have to be used carefully. Used too early, the convalescent patient may still be carrying and shedding the virus, they may still be a risk to others,” said Michael Skinner, a reader in Virology at Imperial College London.It’s due to this risk that countries are likely to continue producing and using RT-PCR tests and combine them with the serological versions.“You might see a mix of the two: one diagnosis to see if you’re still contagious and a serological test to know if you have antibodies,” said Blanchecotte.Another potential pitfall is that it not yet known for certain whether people who have recovered from COVID-19 are immune to reinfection.“In a vast majority of infectious diseases, recovery from disease and evidence of a strong immune response would lead to a period of immunity from re-occurrence,” said Preston.“(But) the caveat is that we don’t know for sure that a positive antibody test does imply someone is immune (from COVID-19).”Most countries in lockdown still lack testing capacity, so it is not at all clear when restrictions on movement could be lifted, even with a widely available antibody test.But serologic tests are the only way to know for sure what percentage of humanity has been infected with COVID-19, which will help inform a variety of current unknowns, not least mortality rates.© Agence France-Presse"

Patients who are unable to speak cannot effectively participate in medical decision-making and may not effectively communicate their needs and symptoms. This could greatly impact their care”, a statement posted on the PASP’s FB page said.COVID-19 patients, as part of protocol, are isolated during their confinement and thus cannot rely on their relatives or personal caregivers to have their needs communicated to health workers.The communication boards, which are available in Filipino, English, and Tagalog, may be downloaded for free via a link at the group’s FB page, for distribution to hospitals handling COVID-19 patients.“For COVID-19 cases, communication boards are recommended to be for SINGLE-PATIENT USE ONLY and must be disposed of properly when a patient does not need it anymore”, the statement said, hence the need to produce as many boards as possible.The group invited those who wish to avail of the communication boards kit or to help in its production to visit their FB page for the appropriate links.Ventilators, as explained in an FYI on COVID-19 Management posted by the DOH, are needed by critical COVID-19 patients to assist their breathing, as the virus causes inflammation of the airways and loss of function of the lungs."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/doctors-warn-of-malaria-drug-scarcity/,Antibody tests key to ending COVID-19 lockdowns,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Limited global stocks of two anti-malarial drugs could wreck plans to use the medicines, currently in clinical trials, to treat COVID-19, doctors cautioned on Thursday.Around the world, countries are expanding access to chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which are used to treat malaria and are known to have anti-viral properties.The medicines have shown early promise against the COVID-19 illness in studies in France and China.CQ, which is the less toxic of the two, is also used as an anti-inflammatory to treat conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, purposes it is primarily known for outside the tropics.Writing in the Annals of Rheumatic Diseases, doctors in Italy — the country hardest hit by COVID-19 — said that limited supply could scupper any widespread attempt to use the two drugs against the virus.They also cautioned that it was vital that patients already taking chloroquine for other illnesses should not be deprived of their supply.“In some European countries the availability of HCQ and CQ in the pharmacies (outside the hospitals) is already scarce,” Francesca Romana Spinelli, assistant professor at the Sapienza University of Rome and letter author, told AFP.“This is an emerging problem for many patients already treated with CQ/HCQ for their autoimmune rheumatic disease.”Both medicines are known to have anti-viral properties and have shown some encouraging results in trials against COVID-19.But they have a number of potentially serious side effects, and there are fears that treating COVID-19 patients, many of whom are on medication for underlying conditions, could court disaster.On Wednesday the European Medicine Agency warned that CQ and HCQ should only be used on COVID-19 patients in clinical trials or in case of a “national emergency”.Iain McInnes, president of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), said that more research was needed before governments could consider rolling out the two drugs against the virus.He said he was concerned “that the diversion of drug supplies away from people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases may compromise the health of this important and sizable group of patients in Europe and beyond.”In the letter, Italian doctors said using CQ and HCQ as widespread COVID-19 treatments would raise ethical concerns, given their known side effects.“If mass prophylaxis was accepted as an option worldwide, this would raise the question of whether there is enough supply of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to support this approach,” they added.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/coronavirus-the-worst-global-crisis-since-ww-ii-says-un-chief/,Coronavirus the worst global crisis since WW II,1,"The coronavirus pandemic is the worst global crisis since World War II, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Tuesday, expressing concern that it could trigger conflicts around the world.Guterres said that the scale of the crisis was due to “a disease that represents a threat to everybody in the world and… an economic impact that will bring a recession that probably has no parallel in the recent past.”“The combination of the two facts and the risk that it contributes to enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict are things that make us believe that this is the most challenging crisis we have faced since the Second World War,” he told reporters.The New York-based United Nations was founded at the end of the war in 1945 and has 193 member states.“A stronger and more effective response… is only possible in solidarity if everybody comes together and if we forget political games and understand that it is humankind that is at stake,” Guterres added.More than 40,000 people have been killed so far as the disease spreads across the world, and causes economic devastation.“We are far from having a global package to help the developing world to create the conditions both to suppress the disease and to address the dramatic consequences,” Guterres warned, pointing to unemployment, the collapse of small firms and vulnerable people in the informal economy.“We are slowly moving in the right direction, but we need to speed up, and we need to do much more if we want to defeat the virus.”The UN on Tuesday created a new fund to help developing countries after last week appealing for donations for poor and conflict-hit nations.Beyond traditional aid from rich countries “we need to have innovative financial instruments,” so that developing nations are able to respond to the crisis, Guterres said.He warned that the coronavirus outbreak could return from poorer countries, especially in Africa, to hit wealthy countries again, and that millions could die."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/race-for-vaccine-tests-limits-of-drug-innovation/,says UN chief,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — From medical workers struggling to care for the rising tide of COVID-19 patients to the billions of people told to stay home to slow the pandemic, everyone is waiting for one thing: a vaccine.There is no known treatment for the new coronavirus that emerged in China late last year and has since proliferated across the planet, infecting more than half a million people and claiming more than 30,000 lives.In mid-January, researchers from China published the genetic sequence of the virus, firing the starting gun for dozens of research labs across the world in the race to find effective drugs.The approaches have varied dramatically. Some teams are looking at the effects of existing medicines as potential treatments, some are experimenting with repurposing common drugs. Others are using cutting-edge technologies to fashion radically new types of vaccines.Just over 60 days after the genetic sequence of COVID-19 was shared, the first potential vaccine began human trials.World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hailed it “an incredible achievement” and experts have raised cautious hopes that a vaccine will be ready within 18 months.This may seem like a dauntingly long time for those in the path of the virus.But Seth Berkley, the head of GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, has cautioned that it normally takes between 10 and 15 years for a drug to go from development, through testing phases and onto licensing and large-scale manufacture, although the Ebola vaccine was ready in five.“How lucky will we be in getting a good immune response? Which approaches will work? Will they be scalable?” he said in an interview with the TED organization last week.While the world will try to “squeeze it down dramatically”, the timeline will still depend on the testing process.“There are many things we’re going to have to go through and it’s really about making sure that vaccine works and it is safe for use in what ultimately maybe billions of people,” he said.GAVI, which is making funding available for lower-income countries to respond to the coronavirus crisis, has urged world leaders to ensure potential treatments and vaccines are accessible to everyone.Amid concerns over a shortfall in global cooperation over the virus, G20 nations on Thursday announced a $5-trillion injection to boost the global economy and pledged to “work together to increase research and development funding for vaccines and medicines”.The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global organization based in Oslo, has called for $2 billion to support the development of a vaccine.Meanwhile, the United States is funding several companies through its Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Institutes of Health (NIH).The traditional method for developing vaccines, based on principles dating back to smallpox vaccine in 1796, has been to introduce a modified part of the infectious agent to stimulate the body’s immune system without doing harm.But an emerging technique aims to trigger this immune response in a different way, by incorporating a strand of the virus’ genetic material.Within weeks of Chinese researchers making the genome of the virus public, a team at the University of Texas at Austin was able to create a replica model of its spike protein, the part which attatches to and infects human cells, and image it using a cryogenic (cooled) electron microscope.This replica itself is now the basis for a vaccine candidate. NIH is working with Moderna, a relatively new firm founded in 2010, to make a vaccine using the protein’s genetic information to grow it inside human muscle tissue, rather than having to inject it in.This information is stored in an intermediary transient substance called “messenger RNA” that carries genetic code from DNA to cells.“The advantage is that it’s really fast,” Jason McLellan, who led the UT Austin team, told AFP.The human trials began this month and if all goes to plan, it could be available in about a year and a half, according to NIH’s Anthony Fauci.French drugmaker Sanofi is using a different genetic approach.It is partnering with the US government to use a so-called “recombinant DNA platform” to produce a vaccine candidate.It takes the virus’ DNA and combines it with DNA from a harmless virus, creating a chimera that can provoke an immune response.The antigens it produces can then be scaled up.The technology is already the basis of Sanofi’s influenza vaccine, and the firm believes it has a head start due to a SARS vaccine it developed that offered partial protection in animals.While the world waits for a vaccine, scientists are experimenting with other existing drugs in the hunt for treatments for severely ill patients.The WHO has selected four drugs or combinations for a large scale global trial involving patients from Argentina to Thailand.These are the experimental antiviral treatment remdesivir; a combination of two HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir; those two drugs plus interferon beta, an immune system medication; and the malaria drug chloroquine.Remdesivir, made by US-based Gilead Sciences, is already in the final stages of clinical trials in Asia and doctors in China have reported it has proven effective in fighting the disease.It was developed to fight other viruses including Ebola (where it was shown to be ineffective) and it has not yet been approved for anything.Remdesivir gets modified inside the human body to become similar to one of the four building blocks of DNA, called nucleotides.Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, told AFP that when viruses copy themselves, they do it “quickly and a bit sloppily,” meaning they might incorporate remdevisir into their structure — though human cells, which are more fastidious, won’t make the same mistake.If the virus incorporates the remdesivir into itself, the drug adds unwanted mutations that can destroy the virus.In an early trial, the lopinavir-ritonavir combination had disappointing results in a study of 199 patients in Wuhan, China, published this month in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers concluded that the drugs did not significantly improve clinical outcomes.US President Donald Trump has stoked excitement about hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ), related compounds that are synthetic forms of quinine, which comes from cinchona trees and has been used for centuries to treat malaria.HCQ, which is the less toxic of the two, is also used as an anti-inflammatory to treat conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.The medicines have shown promise against the COVID-19 illness in early studies in France and China.But Fauci has cautioned that the small studies carried out so far amount to “anecdotal” evidence.And the drugs are not without their risks.About one percent of people are at high risk of blackouts, seizure or even sudden death from cardiac arrest because of heart rhythm issues they may themselves be unaware of, Michael Ackerman, a genetic cardiologist at Mayo Clinic told AFP.Regeneron last year developed an intravenous drug that was shown to significantly boost survival rates among Ebola patients using what are known as “monoclonal antibodies”.They genetically modified mice to give them human-like immune systems. The mice are exposed to viruses, or weakened forms of them, in order to produce human antibodies, Christos Kyratsous, the company’s vice president of research told AFP.These antibodies are then isolated and screened to find the most potent ones, which are grown in labs, purified and given to humans intravenously.The drug could work as both a treatment and as a vaccine, by dosing up people before they are exposed — though these effects would be only temporary.One CEPI-backed project — a collaboration with France’s Institut Pasteur, biotech firm Themis and the University of Pittsburgh — uses the measles vaccine as “a vehicle”.This would take a vaccine that is widely manufactured across the world and redesign it to express the antigen of the new coronavirus.Australian scientists are taking an even more direct approach.Researchers at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Melbourne are fast-tracking large-scale human testing of the BCG vaccine, used for decades to prevent tuberculosis, to see if it can protect health workers from COVID-19.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/study-shows-middle-age-covid-19-mortality-risk/,Race for vaccine tests limits of drug innovation,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Middle-aged people, and not just the elderly, have a dramatically higher risk of dying or developing serious illness from COVID-19, new research from Britain showed Tuesday.The findings came in a new comprehensive analysis of virus cases in mainland China.Researchers from Britain analyzed more than 3,600 confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as data from hundreds of passengers repatriated from the outbreak city of Wuhan.They found that age was a key determining factor in serious infections, with nearly one in five over-80s requiring hospitalization, compared to around 1 percent among people under 30.Taking into account estimates of the number of cases that may not have been clinically confirmed — that is, mild or asymptomatic infections — the data showed the hospitalization rate of patients in their fifties was 8.2 percent.The study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, estimated that the mortality rate from confirmed COVID-19 cases in mainland China was 1.38 percent.If unconfirmed cases were taken into account, the death rate dropped to 0.66 percent.The authors of the research said that while this was significantly lower than previous estimates, COVID-19 is still several times deadlier than previous pandemic viruses, such as H1N1.“Our estimates can be applied to any country to inform decisions around the best containment policies for COVID-19,” said Azra Ghani, a study co-author from Imperial College London.“There might be outlying cases that get a lot of media attention, but our analysis very clearly shows that at aged 50 and over, hospitalization is much more likely than in those under 50, and a greater proportion of cases are likely to be fatal.”Billions of people have been confined to their homes around the world as governments desperately try to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.As of 1900 GMT Monday the virus had killed 36,374 people out of 757,940 cases globally.That would mean 4.8 percent of all confirmed COVID-19 infections have proven deadly.But experts stress that without widespread testing it is impossible to know how many people may have become infected and recovered.This means the true mortality rate is likely much lower, in line with The Lancet study and previous research from China.The Lancet study showed that 18.4 percent of patients in their 80s were hospitalized in China.This compared to 4.3 percent for 40 to 49-year-olds and roughly 1 percent for people in their 20s.According to their modeling, the authors estimate that 50-80 percent of the global population could contract COVID-19 — but that came with several caveats, as modeling can’t account for behavioral changes such as hand washing and social distancing.Devi Sridhar, professor and chair of Global Public Health, at the University of Edinburgh’s Medical School, said that the assumption that most people would become infected was leading governments, including in Britain, to abandon measures that could help slow the pandemic.She tweeted on Tuesday that the models “resulted in the UK giving up on containment too early & assuming everyone will get it.“Planning & preparing for unprecedented testing & using big data/apps for tracing were taken off the table. In my view, we went down the wrong path,” she said.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/mental-issues-sparked-by-pandemic-could-be-silent-killer-red-cross/,#PlayApartTogether: WHO,1,", (AFP) — The Red Cross called Friday for increased psychological support to health workers and others fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, warning of rising suicides as a result of pressure and isolation.Countries around the world have taken dramatic measures to try to halt the spread of the virus, which first emerged in China late last year, with more than three billion people now living under lockdown.The demand for psycho-social support has “increased significantly” since the start of the crisis, said Jagan Chapagain, the secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).In an interview with AFP, he said he understood that providing mental health support “may not be very high on the agenda as we are trying to contain the virus,” but stressed that the issue is important and “impacts millions and millions of people.”“I think that could be the big silent killer if sufficient attention is not paid to psychosocial needs and mental health needs,” he said.IFRC president Francesco Rocca agreed, telling journalists in a virtual briefing Friday that “the risk of suicide is increasing with the isolating of people.”The strict rules against gatherings and on maintaining physical distance from other people are expected to slow down the spread of the virus, which has claimed nearly 25,000 lives and infected more than half a million people worldwide.But they are also clearly increasing levels of stress, depression, anxiety and other mental health issues.Chapagain said increased stress also “affects many other health conditions.”“Higher stress means lower immunity. It impacts on your health, on your social relationships,” he said, also pointing to reports of more domestic violence as families are cooped up together in a stressful environment.“Psycho-social support… is terribly needed,” Rocca said.He and Chapagain acknowledged that there were no statistics available yet to prove mental health issues and suicides are increasing, but said the discussions they are having with health workers and others clearly point in that direction.“We know that this is the trend,” said Rocca, who was speaking from his home country Italy, where he has been touring hard-hit medical facilities.For “fragile people, there are a lot of consequences of being isolated,” he said, adding that a few days ago an Italian nurse had committed suicide just days after testing positive for COVID-19 because she feared she had spread the disease to others.Rocca spoke about the strain felt by health workers, and the Red Cross volunteers who sometimes assist them, when they cannot provide physical human contact to comfort patients and their families.“We are missing… the hug,” he said, describing how he himself felt earlier this week when a volunteer told him her mother had just died.“I couldn’t hug her. She was crying two metres away from me… And I couldn’t hug,” he said, adding that the pandemic in this respect was worse than other crises.“Even in the conflict areas we can hug each other when we are afraid. The terrible thing of this (pandemic) is the lack of the human touch, the physical human touch,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/nature-takes-back-worlds-empty-city-streets/,US regulator approves limited use of malaria drugs for virus,1,", (AFP) — As humans retreat into their homes as more and more countries go under coronavirus lockdown, wild animals are slipping cover to explore the empty streets of some of our biggest cities.Wild boar have descended from the hills around Barcelona while sika deer are nosing their way around the deserted metro stations of Nara, Japan.Indian social media has gone wild about footage of a , the capital of the northern state of Uttarakhand.Gangs of wild turkeys have been strutting the streets of Oakland, California, while a puma turned up in the centre of the Chilean capital Santiago, which is under curfew.“This is the habitat they once had and that we’ve taken away from them,” said Marcelo Giagnoni, the head of Chile’s agricultural and livestock service that helped police capture the curious big cat.While sightings of dolphins in Venice’s canals turned out to be fanciful, they have been popping up in ports elsewhere in the Mediterranean as emboldened wildlife takes “free rein to wander our cities and towns”, said Romain Julliard, head of research at the French Natural History Museum.He told AFP that foxes were at the vanguard of the new urban explorers. “They change their behaviour very quickly. When a place becomes quiet, they’re straight in there.”Animals and birds that normally live in urban parks, like sparrows and pigeons are also more likely to venture beyond their usual territories, Julliard said, “freeing a space for other animals”.While the dawn and dusk choruses have been bringing comfort to many quarantined city dwellers, the museum’s acoustics specialist Jerome Sueur said that doesn’t mean there are more urban birds than before.It is more that with reduced traffic noise we can hear them better. Some, however, “stop singing when there is noise, so now they are letting themselves go.”“Animals are shaking off human noise pollution,” Sueur said. And the timing could not have been better time as they embark on their mating season.With the hunting season suspended in several European countries, this promises to be a spring and possibly a summer of love for the animal kingdom.It is certainly great news for species like the common toad and the spotted salamander. The amorous amphibians are being spared from being “crushed crossing busy roads” in their haste to find a mate, said Jean-Noel Rieffel, of the French biodiversity office (OFB).With few dog walkers to disturb them, baby fawns are also getting an idyllic start to life while birds like Mediterranean gulls who nest along the sandy banks of rivers are being left undisturbed.In the Calanques National Park overlooking the Mediterranean near France’s second city of Marseille, wildlife “is reclaiming its natural habitat with surprising speed”, said the park’s president, Didier Reault.With walkers and boating banned, “the puffins who used to stay on the islets in the highest protected areas are not gathering on the sea,” he said.And it is the same for plants. Wild orchids — which are supposed to be protected — are often picked by walkers when they blossom in late April and May, said Rieffel. This year they will be spared that fate.And in the cities and suburbs, unmowed lawns will be a source of “bounty for bees, bumble bees and butterflies”, Julliard added.But for him, the biggest change is the effect this is having on humans. “The most important phenomenon perhaps is our relationship with nature changing — with people locked up in their homes realising how much they miss nature,” he said.Stuck indoors, with their worlds reduced to a few square metres (yards), confined urbanites have suddenly become avid birdwatchers.British ornithologist David Lindo, who is known as the “Urban Birder”, has been tweeting and livestreaming birds he spots from the roof of the building in Spain where he has been quarantined.“The sky is a great arena, anything can fly past and, at the very least, it will give you peace. My message is simple: keep looking up,” he told his new-found followers.However, there are also down sides to the lockdown for nature.Work to limit invasive species has been all but halted, cautioned Loic Obled of the OFB, as well as that to help endangered species.And when the lockdown finally ends, Rieffel warned that “people will have a need of nature and there is a risk of too many visitors (to natural parks), which won’t be good for the flora and fauna.”The birds which have nested in the yard of an abandoned school or factory will find themselves disturbed, he warned. Nature’s respite from man may be rather short-lived.© Agence France-Presse"

Stringent quarantine measures and lockdowns have been put in place in various regions across the globe to stem the spread of the virus while scientists and medical experts are trying to find a vaccine for COVID-19, and a cure for the disease.The World Health Organization (WHO) has also called on all countries implementing lockdowns to aggressively isolate and treat coronavirus cases, while also aggressively doing contact tracing.Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said that it was also important to strengthen and capacitate the health workers, giving them the needed personal protective equipment that they need.“One of the most important areas of international cooperation is research and development. A vaccine is still at least 12 to 18 months away,” he said in an earlier statement.“In the meantime, we recognize that there is an urgent need for therapeutics to treat patients and save lives,” Dr. Tedros said.He also called on individuals and countries “to refrain from using therapeutics that have not been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.”“The history of medicine is strewn with examples of drugs that worked on paper, or in a test tube, but didn’t work in humans or were actually harmful,” the WHO chief said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/hospitals-turn-to-snorkel-masks-to-ease-respirator-overload/,Nature takes back world’s empty city streets,1,"Brussels, Belgium (AFP) — As hospitals face an overload of COVID-19 patients struggling to breathe, innovative medical staff are turning to snorkelling masks from sports stores to stop their lungs collapsing.The idea started in Italy, the European country worst-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with hospitals in other nations taking note and adding their own specific medical parts to make it work.One such is the Erasme Hospital on the outskirts of Belgium’s capital Brussels. It is attached to the city’s ULB university — and through it to a private spin-off, Endo Tools Therapeutics, whose knowhow in 3D printing for medical use has proved invaluable.“They are to be used for patients with severe respiratory problems. The aim is to avoid having to intubate the trachea of the patient and put them on a respirator,” said Frederic Bonnier, a respiratory physiotherapist at the hospital who also teaches at the university.He spearheaded the design of a custom-made valve that fits to the top of full-face masks, where the snorkel is meant to go, allowing them to connect to standard BiPAP machines that feed pressurised air into masks.This helps prevent the collapse of alveoli, lung air sacs needed for the intake of oxygen into our bodies and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Pneumonia brought on by COVID-19 inflames the lung membrane and fills those sacs with liquid.In the worst-case infections, patients have to be hooked up to respirators in intensive-care units.But respirators are in desperately short supply worldwide because of the sheer number of patients.The snorkelling mask solution could be a stop-gap measure for patients on the brink of intensive-care treatment but for whom no beds nor respirators are available. Hospital masks for the less-intensive BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) machines are also lacking.Bonnier said that from Monday he will testing 50 of the masks on patients.They are the same brand as those used by Italian doctors, donated by the French sportswear retailer Decathlon that has stores worldwide. The masks themselves are made in Italy.He explained they were far more comfortable than the hospital ones that fit over the nose and mouth, biting into the skin. But he cautioned they were not tested to medical standards, meaning they were one-use only, unable to be sterilised between patients.The Italian design for the 3D-printed valve also needed reworking.“It seemed fairly complicated to make, pretty heavy, not very comfortable. So we had the idea to go a little further by thinking on it and developing our own connection part,” he said.The new plastic valve connectors have now been 3D-printed and are ready to be tested.Bonnier added that health workers in COVID-19 wards could also use the masks for protection against the virus. But he fears the public will start panic-buying them, thereby depriving hospitals of a potentially life-saving product.He also said that, even if the tests prove conclusive, there were still questions about how many such masks could be made available by sporting companies, under what conditions. Learning of the emergency use being made of its snorkelling masks, Decathlon expressed “interest” — but also prudence.“At the moment we don’t have confirmation that these solutions really work,” it said on its Twitter account.“If we see successful try-outs, and these hospitals confirm to us that some tests work, then we’ll keep you informed. But in the meantime, beware of unsourced and unverified information spread on social media in recent days.”"

We will overcome this one too. The question is how large a price we will pay?” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization in his latest remarks as virus cases continued to spike across the globe.Dr. Tedros recommended six key actions, noting that shutting down populations through a lockdown might buy time, but not won’t extinguish the pandemic.The coronavirus has so far killed more than 24,000 patients and infected more than 531,000 people globally, based on the latest data from the Johns Hopkins University.“Asking people to stay at home and shutting down population movement is buying time and reducing the pressure on health systems. But on their own, these measures will not extinguish epidemics,” he said.“There are six key actions that we recommend:First, expand, train and deploy your health care and public health workforce;Second, implement a system to find every suspected case at community level;Third, ramp up the production, capacity and availability of testing;Fourth, identify, adapt and equip facilities you will use to treat and isolate patients;Fifth, develop a clear plan and process to quarantine contacts;And sixth, refocus the whole of government on suppressing and controlling COVID-19.These measures are the best way to suppress and stop transmission, so that when restrictions are lifted, the virus doesn’t resurge,” he said in his opening remarks at a media briefing on March 25.Dr. Tedros said that “the last thing any country needs is to open schools and businesses, only to be forced to close them again because of a resurgence.”“Aggressive measures to find, isolate, test, treat and trace are not only the best and fastest way out of extreme social and economic restrictions – they’re also the best way to prevent them,” he said.“We call on all countries who have introduced so-called “lockdown” measures to use this time to attack the virus,” the WHO chief said.“You have created a second window of opportunity.

Both were treated in intensive care units and tested negative for the virus on the sixth day of life.The premature baby experienced the most severe illness including pneumonia, shortness of breath and sepsis, which all eventually resolved with treatment in intensive care including ventilation, antibiotics and caffeine, while his coronavirus test returned negative on his seventh day of life.All three survived.Chinese experts have previously reported it may be possible that so-called “vertical transmission” from pregnant mothers to babies can occur after a newborn was detected with the virus 30 hours after birth.This might be occurring across the placenta or during the process of childbirth.“Therefore, it is crucial to screen pregnant women and implement strict infection control measures, quarantine of infected mothers, and close monitoring” of newborns, the team concluded.© Agence France-Presse"

So why are so few countries able to follow it?While nations like South Korea have been praised for their decisive efforts to control the spread of the virus with mass screening, experts say many other countries have been unable to emulate their approach.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus acknowledged this on Monday, saying that the organization recognized that “some countries are struggling with the capacity to carry out these offensive measures”.But his message remains the same: “To win, we need to attack the virus with aggressive and targeted tactics — testing every suspected case, isolating and caring for every confirmed case, and tracing and quarantining every close contact.”Existing tests, called RT-PCR, are designed to detect the virus in respiratory specimens from nasal or oral swabs, based on genetic analysis.The results can be ready within hours.But testing levels have diverged widely across the world.“It all depends on the level of development of the countries,” Antoine Flahault, a specialist in public health and epidemiology at the University of Geneva, told AFP.South Korea at one point was the country hardest-hit by the virus outside China.It responded with a massive screening campaign, carrying out around 300,000 tests.Authorities quarantined infected people and combined that with an ambitious tracing program that tracked down people they had been in contact with using video surveillance, bank card usage and via smartphone.As a result of these efforts, new cases have fallen below 100 a day.This aggressive testing strategy has also paid off in Singapore, although the city-state this week announced a month-long shutdown of bars and banned mass gatherings.Both countries have largely avoided the large-scale lockdown measures currently in place in many other countries, with related concerns over economic and social consequences.European countries have not tested to the same extent as South Korea, often focussing on people admitted to the hospital with severe symptoms.Flahault said the issue was less a lack of will to test, and more a shortage of the materials needed.“For countries like France and Switzerland, the problem in recent days has been more that of the availability of reagents (substances used in chemical testing process) than machines or human resources,” he said.Why haven’t South Korea and Singapore encountered the same difficulties?French virologist Anne Goffard said they had drawn on their experience facing other epidemics caused by different coronaviruses — namely SARS, which emerged in 2002, and MERS a decade later.This has enabled them to be better prepared and equipped, she told AFP, adding that many European countries would have to assess their manufacturing capacity in the future.Germany, which has the capacity to carry out some 160,000 tests per week “appears to be more autonomous”, she added.In poorer nations, the barrier to testing is even higher.In the Philippines, infectious disease specialist Edsel Salvana has said testing potentially diverts scant resources away from other vital expenditures, like personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers.In comments on Twitter on Tuesday, he was scathing about the focus on testing — “WHO this is CRIMINAL” — and urged a more nuanced approach for resource-stretched nations.“I admire what South Korea did and I would do that if we had as much money and resources. But we don’t, and my colleagues are wearing trash bags for PPE,” he said.After it failed to test extensively at the beginning of its outbreak, France now plans to carry out mass screening at the end of the tough confinement measures it has implemented to try and halt the spread of the virus.This could be facilitated by new kinds of tests, known as serological screening.This process tests blood samples for the presence of antibodies associated with certain viruses or bacteria. It is used to find out if a person’s immune system has reacted to a virus and has potentially built up immunity.Several teams around the world are developing serology tests for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and French health minister Olivier Veran has said he hopes they will be available within weeks.So which approach is the best?In an analysis published by the Washington Post, US epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said: “The best strategy depends critically on which stage of the outbreak you are in and how much testing is available.”He added that countries like the US had passed the point of being able to trace individual cases.But he said even when tough lockdown measures would be needed to wrestle the epidemic under control, “we must vastly expand our testing capacity”.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/loss-of-smell-could-reveal-hidden-virus-cases-experts/,Shortages hamper mass virus testing goals,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — From a mother unable to smell her baby’s nappy to a lawmaker who suddenly could not taste the food, some coronavirus patients have described a loss of olfactory senses — and experts say this might be a new way to detect the virus.Ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists in Britain, the United States and France have noted a growing number of patients in recent weeks with anosmia — the abrupt loss of smell — and have said this could be a sign of COVID-19 in people who otherwise appear well.Official figures suggest the coronavirus has infected some 380,000 people as the pandemic proliferates around the world, but with many cases going undetected experts have become concerned about the potential for people without symptoms to spread the virus.The World Health Organisation lists the most common signs of COVID-19 as fever, tiredness and dry cough.In Britain, ENT doctors have urged health authorities to advise people with a sudden loss of smell or taste to self-isolate even if they have no other symptoms.“Anything we can do to delay transmission is absolutely vital,” Claire Hopkins, the president of the British Rhinological Society, told AFP.Hopkins, who published an open letter on the issue on Friday with ENT UK chief Nirmal Kumar, said she was not surprised when she heard initial reports from Iran and France of COVID-19 patients reporting a loss of smell.Around 40 percent of cases of sudden loss of smell in adults are caused by post-viral anosmia, she said, and previously known coronaviruses are thought to account for up to 15 percent.But she said the turning point came when an Italian colleague working in a hospital in the worst-hit north of the country mentioned he had observed a high incidence of loss of smell among frontline health workers.This led to a flurry of posts on professional message boards.“We all started to note an increase in patients who were young and otherwise completely asymptomatic presenting with new-onset sense of smell loss,” said Hopkins.Nine out of the 20 patients she saw last week had recently lost their ability to smell.“That’s extremely unusual,” she said, adding that several of these patients had called Britain’s health authorities concerned about COVID-19 but were told there was no need to self-isolate because it was not a recognised symptom.Experts in several countries have flagged anosmia as a potential sign of COVID-19.In France, the head of the health service, Jerome Salomon, on Friday said ENT specialists had observed a “surge” in anosmia cases and said while it was still relatively rare, it had been seen in younger patients with “mild” symptoms.The American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery on Sunday noted growing anecdotal evidence that anosmia and dysgeusia — taste disorder — were “significant symptoms” of the virus.In Germany, virologist Hendrik Streeck from the University of Bonn, went house to house in Heinsberg, where around 1000 people were put under a two-week quarantine in February because of a local outbreak.He said some two thirds of infected people reported losing their sense of smell and taste for a few days.“It went so far that one mother could no longer smell her child’s full nappy. Others couldn’t smell their shampoo anymore and their food started to taste bland,” he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.A lack of testing in many countries means that often only those with the most severe symptoms are confirmed to have the virus.But several high-profile patients with milder cases have reported a loss of olfactory senses.Nadine Dorries, the first British politician to test positive, said she lost both her sense of smell and taste.“Eating and drinking warm or cold that’s all I can tell,” she posted on Twitter last week.French basketball player Rudy Gobert, 27, whose positive coronavirus test prompted the NBA to shut down its season, tweeted he had not “been able to smell anything for the last 4 days” on Sunday.Abscent, a UK charity that provides support and advice on olfactory training to a relatively small community of people who have lost their sense of smell, has seen interest “skyrocket”, according to founder Chrissi Kelly.Hopkins has been “inundated” with emails since her statement was published.Many people reported that close contacts and family members had also experienced anosmia symptoms within recent weeks. This is unusual, she said: “We certainly don’t get clusters within groups of friends and family reported in the same way.”She said the advice on sense of smell loss could be particularly useful as a sign for medical workers to get a test or self-isolate, even without other symptoms.“A healthcare worker who is infected unknowingly and spreading infection around colleagues is a disaster because we need to keep the workforce as healthy as possible,” she said.© Agence France-Presse"

This was out of 81,498 confirmed cases. This means that almost 90 percent of the total novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in China had recovered.In terms of numbers, the next country with the most recoveries was Iran with 8,376 recoveries out of 23,049 confirmed infections (or 36 percent recovered from total infections).In terms of percentage, South Korea is next with the most number of recoveries with reported 3,166 recoveries out of the total 8,961 confirmed cases (or over 35 percent patients recovering out of total confirmed cases).In Italy, the new virus epicenter, with 63,927 cases, those who recovered from the infection were 7,342, as of the latest data from the Johns Hopkins University virus dashboard (or over 11 percent recovering from the total virus cases)France has the same percentage of recovered patients. Around 11 percent (10.9 percent) or 2,123 patients recovered from the total number of 20,123 confirmed cases, as of the latest data from JHU.Spain, on the other hand, had 3,355 recoveries out of 35,136 confirmed cases (or over 9 percent recovering so far out of the total cases).The said that there are 378,601 confirmed cases worldwide, while total deaths due to the disease reached 16,505 with Italy reporting the most number of fatalities at more than 6,000 (6,077)Scientists and medical experts from all over the world are now on a race to develop a cure for the pandemic that has so far affected more than 190 countries and territories."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/worldwide-virus-lockdowns-as-who-warns-young-people-not-invincible/,says latest data on global cases,1,"Hundreds of millions of people worldwide kicked off the weekend under a coronavirus lockdown, as the global death toll accelerated sharply and the World Health Organization warned the young they were “not invincible”.The pandemic has completely upended lives across the planet, sharply restricting the movement of huge populations, shutting down schools and businesses, and forcing millions to work from home — while many have lost their livelihoods entirely.While President Donald Trump insisted the United States was “winning” the war against the virus, individual states dramatically ramped up restrictions, with New York and Illinois joining California in ordering residents to stay home.The virus death toll surged past 11,000 worldwide, with 4,000 alone in worst-hit Italy where the daily number of fatalities has shot up relentlessly over the past week.While the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions are the hardest hit by the virus, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that young people were also vulnerable.“Today I have a message for young people: you are not invincible. This virus could put you in hospital for weeks — or even kill you,” Tedros said.“Even if you don’t get sick, the choices you make about where you go could be the difference between life and death for someone else.”China on Saturday reported no new local infections for a third straight day, and the WHO said the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year, offered a glimmer of “hope for the rest of the world”.But there are growing concerns of a new wave of “imported” infections in the region, with Hong Kong reporting 48 suspected cases on Friday –- its biggest daily jump since the crisis began. Many of them have a recent history of travel to or from Europe.Across Europe, governments continued to rigorously enforce lockdown measures as the continent’s most celebrated boulevards and squares remained silent and empty even as warmer spring weather arrived.Italy reported its worst single day, adding another 627 fatalities and taking its reported total to 4,032 despite efforts to stem the spread.The nation of 60 million now accounts for 36 percent of the world’s coronavirus deaths and its death rate of 8.6 percent among confirmed infections is significantly higher than in most other countries.France, Italy, Spain and other European countries have told people to stay at home, threatening fines in some cases, while Bavaria became the first region in Germany to order a lockdown.Britain, falling in line with its neighbours in the European Union, also announced tougher restrictions, telling pubs, restaurants and theatres to close and promising to help cover the wages of affected workers. With virus fears gripping the United States, its largest state California — with over 1,000 cases and 19 deaths — told its 40 million residents to stay at home.New York state, which has reported over 7,000 cases and 39 deaths, followed suit on Friday, ordering its nearly 20 million residents to do the same from Sunday evening.Trump applauded the New York and California decisions, but said he did not think a nationwide lockdown was needed.“Those are really two hotbeds,” he said. “I don’t think we’ll ever find (a US-wide lockdown) necessary.”Shortly after the president spoke, the governor of Illinois ordered residents of the midwestern state to stay at home and the Connecticut governor did the same.The restrictions so far imposed in seven states cover around 100 million people, with the country’s three most populous cities — New York, Los Angeles and Chicago — under lockdown.Trump also announced Friday that the US and Mexico have agreed to restrict non-essential travel across their border beginning on Saturday.Meanwhile a staffer in the office of US Vice President Mike Pence, the pointman for Washington’s response to the outbreak, tested positive for the coronavirus.The family of country music legend Kenny Rogers, who died aged 81, said Friday they would hold a small private service “out of concern” for the virus emergency. France said more than 4,000 people were fined on the first day of confinement and ministers described those breaking the rules as “idiots”.The strict measures follow the template set by China, as a lockdown imposed in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, appeared to have paid off.Europe now accounts for more than half of the world’s fatalities linked to COVID-19.Accurate figures are difficult to come by, however, as many of those who die suffer from other illnesses and infection rates are uncertain because of a lack of testing in many countries.The shadow of the virus is lengthening across Africa and the Middle East too.Gabon confirmed sub-Saharan Africa’s second known death, with reported cases across Africa standing at more than 900 and rising fast.In Iran, both supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani promised the country would overcome the outbreak — but still refused to join the rest of the world in imposing heavy restrictions.In Latin America, Cuba and Bolivia both announced they were closing their borders, and Colombia said it would begin mandatory isolation from Tuesday.The pandemic has sparked fears of a global recession, battering the world’s stock markets and prompting governments to push huge spending plans to limit the damage.Rio de Janeiro’s beaches will be off-limits to sunseekers from Saturday, leaving street vendors worried how they will survive with limited government support.“As long as I can, I will continue to come here and try to sell cocktails. I still have not thought about what I will do when it is no longer possible,” said Jorge Martins on Ipanema beach."

We lack everything here — we live day-to-day,” said bicycle seller Boureima Baguian.“We cannot, for example, close the big market. If that happens, it’s not the coronavirus that will kill us but misery and hunger.”The Democratic Republic of Congo announced similar measures as it reported its first local case, banning flights from affected countries and closing schools and universities for four weeks.South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa’s worst-hit country, has banned cruise ships from its ports. More than 1,700 people are stranded on a liner off Cape Town over fears that some have the virus.It is just the latest blow to tourism across the continent, with coronavirus fears also cancelling sporting, cultural and religious events.Christian and Muslim leaders in Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Senegal said they would suspend services to protect their faithful.A 2016 analysis by the Rand Corporation, a US think-tank, found that of the 25 countries in the world that were most vulnerable to infectious outbreaks, 22 were in Africa — the others were Afghanistan, Yemen and Haiti.The report identified a “disease hotspot belt” extending across the southern rim of the Sahara through the Sahel to the Horn of Africa, where many countries are struggling with conflicts.“Were a communicable disease to emerge within this chain of countries, it could easily spread across borders in all directions, abetted by high overall vulnerability and a string of weak national health systems along the way,” the report warned.Tedros recommended that mass gatherings be avoided, urging Africa to “cut it from the bud, expecting that the worst can happen”.“The best advice for Africa is to prepare for the worst and prepare today,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/uk-rolls-out-tougher-virus-action-after-dire-science-warning/,Nintendo online gaming network back; relief for quarantined gamers,1,", (AFP) — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government on Tuesday unveiled a huge package of support for businesses to help them survive the introduction of tough new social measures to stem the coronavirus outbreak.The Conservative leader said Britain needed to act “like any wartime government”, as finance minister Rishi Sunak unveiled a £330 billion ($400 billion, 363 billion euros) package of loans for virus-hit business.Sunak said the measures were equivalent to 15 percent of GDP and were available to “any business that needs access to cash”, promising to “go further” if necessary.He had already announced £30 billion in state aid for firms and individuals affected by the outbreak at last week’s budget.Emergency legislation is expected to be passed through by MPs unopposed later this week in the fight against coronavirus.Johnson’s government had on Monday ramped up the response to coronavirus, asking people to avoid unnecessary social contact, after new scientific advice that infections and deaths would spiral without drastic action.The changes sparked warnings of massive job losses, particularly in the leisure and hospitality sectors.Johnson said more urgent action was needed, and promised to do “whatever it takes” to tackle the global pandemic, which has infected more than 189,000 and killed over 7,800 worldwide.“Yes, this enemy can be deadly but it is also beatable,” he told a news conference.“We know how to beat it. We know that we will beat it.“And however tough the months ahead, we have the resolve and the resources to win the fight.”Firms told staff to work from home and public transport emptied on Tuesday after the government call for an end to “non-essential” social contact and unnecessary travel. For now though, schools remain open.Confirmed UK cases have climbed to 1,950, with 69 deaths.But the government’s chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance said it was “reasonable” to estimate that 55,000 people could have COVID-19, based on an expected death rate of one in 1,000 cases.“If we can get numbers down to 20,000 and below, that’s a good outcome in terms of where we would hope to get with this outbreak,” he told a parliamentary health committee.“But that’s still horrible. It’s still an enormous number of deaths and an enormous pressure on the health service.”In new developments:– Britons were told only to travel abroad if absolutely necessary for the next 30 days, to avoid being stranded by border closures and flight cancellations.– The state-run National Health Service in England said all non-urgent operations would be postponed from April 15 for at least three months, in a move designed to free up 30,000 beds.– Queen Elizabeth II moved to her Windsor Castle residence west of London a week early, and cancelled several large events.– The Church of England’s most senior cleric, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, said public worship was “suspended until further notice”, but weddings and funerals can still be held.– Tourist attractions, including the National Portrait Gallery in London and Tate museums and galleries, announced closures.Johnson has faced criticism for holding off on imposing the strict measures seen elsewhere.But he stepped up the response on Monday after scientists warned hundreds of thousands could die in Britain if there was only a focus on delaying and slowing infections.Imperial College London’s COVID-19 response team concluded in a paper that suppression was “the preferred policy option” to curb the spread of the virus.It would require “a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members”.“This type of intensive intervention package… will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more),” the report stated.They predicted transmission would “quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed”, it added.The study’s lead author, epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, is advising the British government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which is helping coordinate its COVID-19 response.He said he had also shared the projections with US President Donald Trump’s administration last week and sent it an early copy of the report over the weekend.Ferguson said the government had “no other option” but to implement new measures because modelling from new Italian data indicated 81 percent of Britons and Americans would be infected.Some 510,000 would die in the UK and 2.2 million in the US, peaking after three months, he warned.Mitigation policies would only halve that number and healthcare systems would still be overloaded.© Agence France-Presse"

Now we can ask the question: what is different or missing in people who are fatally ill?”She said the findings had two practical applications.First, it will help virologists develop a vaccine because the goal in vaccination is to replicate the body’s natural immune response to viruses.The team identified four distinct immune-cell populations in the COVID-19 patient’s blood as she underwent recovery.Kedzierska said these were “very similar to what we see in patients with influenza”.Although it kills hundreds of thousands of people annually, a broadly effective vaccine exists against influenza.The second practical application is screening, said Kedzierska.Their observations could also help health authorities make better predictions in future disease outbreaks about who is most at risk.These immune system “markers” could in theory predict with greater accuracy which patients are likely to have mild symptoms and which are at risk of dying.The majority of COVID-19 deaths occur in patients who are elderly or have existing medical conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes.Children, on the other hand, appear to show few or no symptoms. Kedzierska said more research was needed to work out why, but the immune system does naturally slow down as people age.Sharon Lewin, director of the Doherty Institute and one of the world’s leading infectious diseases experts, told AFP that the study results were promising.“It shows that the body makes a very good and powerful immune response to virus and it is associated with symptom clearing,” she said.“Hopefully now we can fish out those antibodies and grow them up to scale,” she said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/new-coronavirus-can-survive-on-surfaces-for-hours-study/,New coronavirus can survive on surfaces for hours: study,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The novel coronavirus can survive on surfaces or in the air for several hours, according to a US-government funded study published Tuesday.Scientists found that the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease had similar levels of viability outside the body to its predecessor that caused SARS.This means that factors like greater transmission between people with no symptoms might be why the current pandemic is far greater than the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003.The new paper was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and carried out by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), University of California, Los Angeles and Princeton.The new coronavirus was detectable for up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, and for up to 24 hours on cardboard.The team used a nebulizer to simulate a person coughing or sneezing, and found that the virus was detectable for three hours in the air.The study was first posted on a medical pre-print website last week before it was peer-reviewed, and attracted much attention, including some criticism from scientists who said that it may have overstated the airborne threat.The virus is predominantly transmitted by respiratory droplets and in this form it is viable for only a few seconds after a person coughs or sneezes.Critics questioned whether a nebulizer accurately mimicked a human cough or sneeze.The team behind the NEJM study performed similar tests on the SARS virus, finding the two viruses behave similarly.But their similar viability fails to explain why the novel coronavirus pandemic has infected close to 200,000 people and caused almost 8,000 deaths, while the SARS epidemic infected about 8,000 and killed nearly 800.“This indicates that differences in the epidemiologic characteristics of these viruses probably arise from other factors, including high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and the potential for persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 to shed and transmit the virus while asymptomatic,” wrote the researchers.SARS-CoV-2 is the technical name for the new coronavirus.The findings affirm guidance from public health professionals regarding social distancing, avoiding touching the face, covering your cough or sneeze, and frequently disinfecting objects using cleaning sprays or wipes.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/avoid-self-medication-with-ibuprofen-against-covid-19-symptoms-who/,Avoid self-medication with ibuprofen against COVID-19 symptoms: WHO,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization recommended Tuesday that people suffering from COVID-19-like symptoms should avoid self-medicating with ibuprofen after French authorities warned anti-inflammatory drugs could worsen the effects of the virus.The warnings over the weekend by French Health Minister Olivier Veran followed a recent study in The Lancet weekly medical journal that hypothesized that an enzyme that is boosted when taking anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen could facilitate and worsen COVID-19 infections.Asked about the study, WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters in Geneva that the UN health agency’s experts were “looking into this to give further guidance.”“In the meantime, we recommend using rather a paracetamol, and do not use ibuprofen as self-medication. That’s important,” he said.He stressed though that if ibuprofen had been “prescribed by the healthcare professionals, then, of course, that’s up to them.”His comments came after Veran sent a tweet cautioning that the use of ibuprofen and similar anti-inflammatory drugs could be “an aggravating factor” in COVID-19 infections.“In the case of fever, take paracetamol,” he wrote.He stressed that patients already being treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, should “ask advice from your doctor.”Paracetamol must be taken strictly according to the dose because too high a dosage can be very dangerous for the liver.The COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 180,000 people worldwide and killed more than 7,000, causes mild symptoms in most people but can result in pneumonia and in some cases severe illness that can lead to multiple organ failure.Even before the pandemic, French authorities last year sounded the alarm over serious “infectious complications” linked to the use of ibuprofen, which is sold under various brands like Nurofen and Advil, and other anti-inflammatory drugs.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/coronavirus-drugs-whos-doing-what-and-when-they-might-come/,Coronavirus drugs: Who’s doing what,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Pharmaceuticals and research labs across the world are racing to find vaccines and treatments for the new coronavirus, using a variety of different technologies.According to Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University-Texarkana, immunizing against the pathogen is a long shot: There has never been a very successful human vaccine against any member of the coronavirus family.“This is going to be a lot of trials, a lot of error, but we have a lot of options to try,” Neuman said.Treatment could come sooner, with antiviral remdesivir showing early promise and already being used on an ad hoc basis before regulatory approval.US President Donald Trump has urged his scientists and drug companies to speed up the process — but experts say fundamental constraints could leave little wiggle room.“A vaccine has to have a fundamental scientific basis. It has to be manufacturable. It has to be safe. This could take a year and a half -— — or much longer,” wrote H. Holden Thorp, the editor-in-chief of the journal Science in response to the president’s calls.“Pharmaceutical executives have every incentive to get there quickly — they will be selling the vaccine after all -— but thankfully, they also know that you can’t break the laws of nature to get there.”The United States is funding several companies through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global organization based in Oslo, is also helping to fund many companies, mostly smaller partners that would lack the capacity to scale-up mass production. It has so far provided about $24 million.What it is: TreatmentWhen it might come: Later this yearOf all the drugs linked to the virus that causes COVID-19, Gilead’s remdesivir could be the closest to market launch. It’s actually not new per se but was developed to fight other viruses including Ebola (where it was shown to be ineffective) and it hasn’t yet been approved for anything.Still, it has shown early promise in treating some coronavirus patients in China, according to doctors, and Gilead is moving ahead with final-stage clinical trials in Asia (known as “Phase 3”). It has also been used to treat at least one US patient so far.NIH’s Anthony Fauci, one of the top government scientists overseeing the coronavirus response, has said it could be available in the next “several months.”“There’s only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy. And that’s remdesivir,” said Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official at a recent press conference in China.Remdesivir gets modified inside the human body to become similar to one of the four building blocks of DNA, called nucleotides.Neuman told AFP that when viruses copy themselves, they do it “quickly and a bit sloppily,” meaning they might incorporate remdevisir into their structure — though human cells, which are more fastidious, won’t make the same mistake.If the virus incorporates the remdesivir into itself, the drug adds unwanted mutations that can destroy the virus.What it is: VaccineWhen it might come: 12-18 monthsWithin weeks of Chinese researchers making the genome of the virus public, a team at the University of Texas at Austin was able to create a replica model of its spike protein, the part which attaches to and infects human cells, and images it using a cryogenic (cooled) electron microscope.This replica itself is now the basis for a vaccine candidate because it may provoke an immune response in the human body without causing harm — the classical method for developing vaccines based on principles dating back to the smallpox vaccine in 1796.NIH is also working with Moderna, a relatively new firm founded in 2010, to make a vaccine using the protein’s genetic information to grow it inside human muscle tissue, rather than having to inject it in.This information is stored in an intermediary transient substance called “messenger RNA” that carries genetic code from DNA to cells.“The advantage is that it’s really fast,” explained Jason McLellan, who led the UT Austin team, whereas the traditional approach of creating the protein outside is difficult to scale and takes a long time.The vaccine began its first human trial on March 16 after being proven effective in mice.If all goes to plan, it could be available on the market in about a year and a half, ready in case the coronavirus outbreak continues until the next flu season, according to Fauci.What it is: Treatment and vaccineWhen it might come: Firm timeline not yet providedRegeneron last year developed an intravenous drug that was shown to significantly boost survival rates among Ebola patients using what are known as “monoclonal antibodies.”To do this, they genetically modified mice to give them human-like immune systems. The mice are exposed to viruses, or weakened forms of them, in order to produce human antibodies, Christos Kyratsous, the company’s vice president of research told AFP.These antibodies are then isolated and screened to find the most potent ones, which are grown in labs, purified and given to humans intravenously.“If everything goes well, we should know what our best antibodies are within the next few weeks,” with human trials to begin by summer, said Kyratsous.The drug could work as both a treatment and as a vaccine, by dosing up people before they are exposed — through these effects would be only temporary.In the near term, they are also trying to repurpose another of their drugs devised using the same platform called Kevzara, which is approved to treat inflammation caused by arthritis.This could help fight the lung inflammation seen in the severe forms of the COVID-19 disease — in other words fighting a symptom as opposed to the virus itself.What it is: VaccineWhen it might come: Time not yet clearThe French drugmaker is partnering with the US government to use a so-called “recombinant DNA platform” to produce a vaccine candidate.It takes the virus’ DNA and combines it with DNA from a harmless virus, creating a chimera that can provoke an immune response.The antigens it produces can then be scaled up.The technology is already the basis of Sanofi’s influenza vaccine and believes it has a head start due to a SARS vaccine it developed that offered partial protection in animals.David Loew, the company’s head of vaccines, is reported to have said Sanofi expects to have a research candidate ready for lab testing within six months and for clinical study within a year and a half.What it is: VaccineWhen it might come: Emergency supplies by end of the year?Inovio, another US biopharmaceutical, has since its founding in the 1980s worked on DNA vaccines — which work in a similar way to RNA vaccines explained above but work at an earlier link of the chain.As an analogy, DNA can be thought of as a reference book in a library, while RNA is like a photocopy of a page from that book containing instructions to carry out a task.“We plan to begin human clinical trials in the US in April and soon thereafter in China and South Korea, where the outbreak is impacting the most people,” said J. Joseph Kim, Inovio’s president, and CEO in a statement.“We plan on delivering one million doses by year-end with existing resources and capacity.”British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline has teamed up with a Chinese biotech firm, providing adjuvant platform technology.An adjuvant is added to some vaccines to enhance the immune response, thereby creating a stronger and longer-lasting immunity against infections than the vaccine alone.Like Moderna, CureVac is working with the University of Queensland on a messenger RNA vaccine. Its CEO Daniel Menichella met with the White House earlier this month and announced the company expects to have a candidate within a few months.American pharma Johnson & Johnson is looking at repurposing some of its existing drugs to see how they might help treat the symptoms of patients already infected with the virus.It’s also working on developing a vaccine involving a deactivated version of the pathogen.California-based Vir biotechnology has isolated antibodies from SARS survivors and is looking to see if these can treat the new coronavirus. Its platform has previously developed treatments for Ebola and other diseases.Even the likes of chloroquine — the synthetic form of quinine, used to treat malaria, may have some properties that fight the virus and scientists are calling for more work to investigate.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/air-pollution-likely-to-cut-covid19-survival-experts/,and when they might come,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Air pollution from petrol and diesel vehicles is likely to increase mortality from the novel coronavirus in cities, public health experts told AFP Monday.The European Public Health Alliance (EPHA) warned that dirty air in urban areas that causes hypertension, diabetes and other respiratory illness could lead to a higher overall death toll from the virus currently sweeping the world.Emissions from petrol and diesel engines were still at “dangerous” levels that could imperil the most vulnerable during this and future pandemics said the European Respiratory Society (EPS), which is a member of the EPHA.“Patients with chronic lung and heart conditions caused or worsened by long-term exposure to air pollution are less able to fight off lung infections and more likely to die,” EPS member Sara De Matteis said.“This is likely also the case for COVID-19,” added de Matteis, who is also an associate professor in occupational and environmental medicine at Italy’s Cagliari University.The virus has so far infected more than 168,000 people and killed over 6,500 worldwide.Several European nations have implemented unprecedented measures to prevent the spread of the disease and allow health systems to treat patients.While there is currently no proven link between COVID-19 mortality and air pollution, one peer-reviewed study into the 2003 SARS outbreak showed that patients in regions with moderate air pollution levels were 84 percent more likely to die than those in regions with low air pollution.COVID-19 is similar to SARS and can cause respiratory failure in severe cases.Mortality data for COVID-19 is incomplete, but preliminary numbers show the majority of patients who die are elderly or have pre-existing chronic conditions such as heart or lung disease.According to the European Environment Agency, air pollution leads to around 400,000 early deaths across the continent annually, despite European Union air quality directives.One COVID-19 hotspot, northern Italy, has particularly high levels of PM10 — microscopic particles of pollution due largely to road traffic.The number of fatalities in Italy shot up by 368 to 1,809 on Sunday — more than half of all the cases recorded outside China.A study published last week in the journal Cardiovascular Research said that air pollution shortens lives worldwide by nearly three years on average, and leads to 8.8 million premature deaths annually.The shutdown in northern Italy has in fact led to a significant reduction in nitrous oxide and small particulate matter in the air, according to satellite data.EPHA Acting Secretary-General Sascha Marschang said that governments must prioritize a reduction in polluting vehicles to avoid unnecessary deaths during future outbreaks.“Governments should have tackled chronic air pollution long ago, but have prioritized the economy over health by going soft on the auto industry,” he said.“Science tells us that epidemics like COVID-19 will occur with increasing frequency,” added.“So cleaning up the streets is a basic investment for a healthier future.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/children-less-sick-from-covid-19-but-can-still-spread-the-virus-says-experts/,Air pollution ‘likely’ to cut COVID19 survival: experts,1,"For reasons unknown, children rarely have severe symptoms when infected by COVID-19 and may even be a bit less likely to get the disease in the first place, experts told AFP.But that doesn’t mean infants, toddlers and teens are not carriers for the new coronavirus, which jumped from animals to humans in central China at the end of last year.As of Friday, there were over 140,000 confirmed cases in 124 countries, with more than 5,000 deaths.Experts estimate that the true number of infections — many with mild or no symptoms — is far higher.“We know children get infected with the virus, but they don’t appear to get very sick or die,” said Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.“What we don’t know is how much these asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic kids transmit,” he told AFP. “This is key to understanding their role in the epidemic.”In a study from mid-February of 44,000 confirmed cases in and around the city of Wuhan, where the pandemic began, the 10-to-19 age bracket made up one percent of infections and a single death.Patients under 10 comprised less than one percent, with no deaths reported.“We are still trying to wrap our heads around the deficit of cases among those under 20,” said Cecile Viboud, an epidemiologist at the US National Institute of Health’s Fogarty International Centre.There are several theories as to why kids, especially young ones, are less prone to serious symptoms.“Children see so many illnesses in the first years of life that their immune systems are tuned up and respond nicely to novel infection,” commented Sharon Nachman, head of paediatric infectious disease at Stony Brook Children’s Hospital in New York state.Whatever the reason, how easily children transmit the disease despite their relative imperviousness to illness “is directly relevant to the idea of closing schools,” according to Viboud. On Thursday French President Emmanuel Macron said all schools in France — from kindergarten to college — would shut their doors as of Monday, until further notice.So far, 29 countries — including Ireland, China, Italy, Poland and Japan — have suspended classes nationwide, affecting nearly 400 million kids, according to UNESCO. Another 20 nations having taken partial measures.Some argue that locking children out of the classroom is not worth the social disruption caused, and that keeping kids at home may further expose older people to the disease.“It might make the epidemic or the ability to manage the consequences worse,” suggested Keith Neal, an emeritus professor of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham.It could, for example, result in a reduction in the number of healthcare workers to care for the sick, and “an increase in grandparents delivering childcare — an age group at much greater risk,” he told AFP.Thomas House, a statistician at the University of Manchester, said there are pros and cons.“It helps to contain the spread of infection, but it creates a wider problem in society, like missing out on an education,” he said.But most experts come down in favour of shuttering schools in order to slow the disease’s progress and distribute the number of critical cases over a longer time period in order to avoid overwhelming critical care units in hospitals, as happened in Wuhan and Italy.Doctors in both places described war-like triage in which they incubated a patient on the last available respirator knowing that one or more others in equal need was likely to die.For Nachman, pulling children out of school is “a very reasonable measure.”“We assume that all children will get infection,” she said in an interview. “But if they pass it to their parents and household contacts, it will be over a longer period of time.”“Instead of getting a hundred people sick tomorrow, we’ll get ten sick for the next ten days, which means less people coming into the hospital all at once.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/on-mission-to-eradicate-virus-germs-china-firms-see-the-uv-light/,Children less sick from COVID-19,1,"BEIJING, China (AFP) — Ultraviolet light is being beamed through public buses and lifts in China to wipe out any possible germs as part of efforts to clear the country of the deadly coronavirus epidemic.With companies under pressure to meet strict prevention measures for the virus, which has killed more than 3,100 people in China, some are turning to new technology to keep everything clean.Shanghai public transport firm Yanggao has converted a regular cleaning room into a UV light disinfection chamber for buses — cutting a 40-minute process down to just five minutes.“After the epidemic happened… we were actively searching for a more efficient disinfection method,” Qin Jin, deputy general manager at Yanggao told AFP.He said that normally the process required the full attention of two staff, who sprayed disinfectant on surfaces in the bus before wiping them down.“The problem with this was that it might not reach certain corners,” said Qin.The group partnered with a technology supplier to set up an ultraviolet cleaning system and now, some of its buses are cleaned by UV rays.Staff drive one bus at a time into the chamber — which has been equipped with 210 UV tubes — and leave the room before activating the system, bathing the vehicle in a blue-white hue.Two cleaning rooms have been converted and each can disinfect up to 250 buses a day, Qin added.With around 1,000 buses needing disinfection daily, the UV system has reduced the amount of staff overtime and manpower needed for regular public transport disinfection.The World Health Organization has cautioned that UV lamps should not be used to sterilise hands or other areas of skin — as UV radiation can cause skin irritation — but Qin said the chambers are closed off and activated by staff outside.Health experts told AFP that UV light is not typically used to disinfect public areas, but can be effective if done right.Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said UV disinfection is effective but needs to be used with care as the light can cause skin cancer.“UV disinfection is widely used in hospitals worldwide after patients have left a room,” he said. “This is used for antimicrobial resistant pathogens, tuberculosis and other infectious agents.”While it is not usually used on public transport, “there is no good reason why (it) would not work”. Yanggao is not the only organisation investing in UV disinfection.China’s central bank said in February it was disinfecting and isolating used banknotes using UV lights in its efforts to combat the coronavirus.A market supervision bureau in southern Guangdong province proposes a “smart UV elevator disinfection system”, which it says eliminates the risk of missing corners or irritating passengers with remnants of cleaning fluids.UV tubes are installed in lifts and activated when the system detects no one is inside, sweeping the area with penetrating UV rays and automatically turning off when it’s done.The plan is to eventually install the system in public spaces such as hospital elevators."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/watch-fight-covid-19-wash-your-hands-properly-to-prevent-spread-of-infection/,but can still spread the virus,1,"(Eagle News) – Proper handwashing is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), according to the World Health Organization (WHO).“Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands,” a WHO advisory said.It is important to wash your hands before touching the mouth, nose and eyes because these are the ways by which the virus can enter the body.“Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth,” WHO said detailing the “basic protective measures against the new coronavirus”“Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick,” WHO said.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists these Follow these five steps every time. 1. Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap. 2. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. 3. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice. 4. Rinse your hands well under clean, running water. 5. Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them“Washing your hands is easy, and it’s one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs,” the US CDC said.“Clean hands can stop germs from spreading from one person to another and throughout an entire community—from your home and workplace to childcare facilities and hospitals,” it added.Aside from handwashing, using alcohol or sanitizers with at least 70 percent alcohol content before touching your face, nose and mouth is also another effective way to prevent the virus from entering the body.Practicing respiratory hygiene is also another way of preventing the spread of the virus.“Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/this-is-a-controllable-pandemic-who-chief-says-of-covid-19-spread-urges-all-to-double-efforts-to-contain-virus/,says experts,1,"(Eagle News) — The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) clarified on Thursday, March 12, that its earlier announcement of the coronavirus disease spread as a “pandemic” does not mean that countries should give up, and stressed that the COVID-19 is a “controllable pandemic.”WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that countries should instead “double down” and work on measures to control and contain the virus with the “political commitment” needed to stem its spread.“Let me be clear: describing this as a pandemic does not mean that countries should give up. The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous,” Dr. Tedros said.“On the contrary, we have to double down,” he said.“This is a controllable pandemic. Countries that decide to give up on fundamental public health measures may end up with a larger problem, and a heavier burden on the health system that requires more severe measures to control,” he stressed.Dr. Tedros, first WHO Director-General to have been elected from multiple candidates by the World Health Assembly in May 2017, said that they are concerned that some countries are still not approaching the COVID-19 threat “with the level of political commitment needed to control it” despite frequent warnings from WHO.He said that this was one of the two reasons that WHO decided to describe the global COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic.The first main reason for the declaration was also the “speed and the scale of the transmission.”“Almost 125,000 cases have now been reported to WHO, from 118 countries and territories. In the past two weeks, the number of cases reported outside China has increased almost 13-fold, and the number of affected countries has almost tripled,” he said.The WHO chief urged all countries to “strike a fine balance between protecting health, preventing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights.”“We urge all countries to take a comprehensive approach tailored to their circumstances – with containment as the central pillar,” he said.“We are calling on countries to take a four-pronged strategy: First, prepare and be ready.”“There are still 77 countries and territories with no reported cases, and 55 countries and territories that have reported 10 cases or less. And all countries with cases have unaffected areas. You have an opportunity to keep it that way. Prepare your people and your health facilities,” Dr. Tedros said.The second strategy is to “detect, prevent and treat.”“You can’t fight a virus if you don’t know where it is. That means robust surveillance to find, isolate, test and treat every case, to break the chains of transmission,” the WHO chief said.The third strategy is to “reduce and suppress,” he said.“To save lives we must reduce transmission. That means finding and isolating as many cases as possible, and quarantining their closest contacts. Evenif you cannot stop transmission, you can slow it down and protect health facilities, old age homes and other vital areas – but only if you test all suspected cases,” Dr. Tedros explained.The fourth strategy is to “innovate and improve.”WHO said that the COVID-19 is a “new virus and a new situation.”“We’re all learning and we must all find new ways to prevent infections, save lives, and minimize impact. All countries have lessons to share,” the WHO director general said.Dr. Tedros also thanked those who have been supporting WHO in efforts to control COVID-19, and the countries which have contributed “fully flexible funds.”He said that more than US$440 million have been pledged to WHO’s Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan.He said WHO has already shipped supplies of personal protective equipment to 57 countries, and is preparing to ship to a further 28.They have also shipped laboratory supplies to 120 countries, and have published a research and development roadmap with a set of core protocols for how studies should be done.Dr. Tedros urged everybody to avail of the WHO resources to help them fight the virus.“As I keep saying, we’re all in this together,” he said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/dont-panic-says-us-woman-who-recovered-from-coronavirus/,On mission to eradicate virus germs,1,"SEATTLE, United States (AFP) — An American woman who has recovered from the novel coronavirus has a simple message for people who are worried: Don’t panic — but do think about high-risk individuals and stay home if you feel ill.Elizabeth Schneider lives in Seattle, the biggest city of Washington state, which has the most deaths in the United States from the disease sweeping the globe.The 37-year-old, who has a PhD in bioengineering, said she was sharing her story “to give people a little bit of hope” through her own relatively mild experience with the infection, which she treated herself from home.But, she added, “obviously, it’s not something to be completely nonchalant about, because there are a lot of people who are elderly or have underlying health conditions.“That means that we need to be extra vigilant about staying home, isolating ourselves from others.”This week, US health authorities citing Chinese data said 80 percent of cases have been mild, while the remaining serious cases that required hospitalization affected mainly people over 60 and those with conditions like diabetes, heart disease or lung disease. Schneider first began experiencing flu-like symptoms on February 25, three days after going to a party that was later identified as the place where at least five other people also got infected.“I woke up and I was feeling tired, but it was nothing more than what you normally feel when you have to get up and go to work, and I had been very busy the previous weekend,” she told AFP in an interview Wednesday.By midday, however, she felt a headache coming on, along with a fever and body aches. She decided to leave the office of the biotechnology company where she works as a marketing manager, and went home.After waking up from a nap, Schneider found she had a high temperature, which peaked at 103 degrees Fahrenheit that night (39.4 Celsius).“And at that point, I started to shiver uncontrollably, and I was getting the chills and getting tingling in my extremities, so that was a little concerning,” she said.She turned to over-the-counter flu medications to treat the symptoms and called a friend to be on standby in case she needed to be taken to an emergency room — but the fever began to recede in the coming days.Schneider had been following news reports about the novel coronavirus. The first US case was detected in Washington in late January.The state has since gone on to become the epicenter of the disease in the country, with more than 260 cases and at least two dozen deaths. Nationwide, there have been more than 1,100 cases and 30 deaths.Because she didn’t have the most common symptoms like a cough or shortness of breath, “I thought, okay, well that’s definitely why I don’t have coronavirus,” said Schneider.She had gotten a flu shot but assumed her illness was a different strain. A visit to the doctor would only result in her being asked to go home, rest and drink plenty of fluids. A few days later, however, she discovered through a friend’s Facebook post that several people from the party had all developed similar symptoms, and she began to get more suspicious.Several of these people went to their doctors, where they were found to be negative for the flu, but they were not offered coronavirus tests because they too were not coughing or having breathing trouble.Knowing that she would also likely be turned down for the test, she decided to enroll in a research program called the Seattle Flu Study, hoping it might provide an answer. The team behind the study sent her a nasal swab kit, which she mailed back and waited several more days.“I finally got a phone call from one of the research coordinators on Saturday (March 7), telling me that ‘You have tested positive for COVID-19,'” she said.“I was a little bit pleasantly surprised, because I thought it was a little bit cool,” Schneider admitted, laughing, though her mother cried when she told her.“Granted, I probably would not have felt that way if I was severely ill,” she said. “But from a scientific curiosity perspective, I thought it was very interesting. And also the fact that I finally got confirmation that that’s what I had.”By this time, her symptoms had already subsided, and she was told by local health authorities to remain at home for at least seven days after the onset of symptoms or 72 hours after they subsided.It’s now been a week since she’s felt better. She has started going out for errands but is still avoiding large gatherings and continuing to work from home.Schneider said she hoped her example, which will probably be typical of the high majority of cases, could comfort others.“The message is don’t panic,” said Schneider. “If you think that you have it, you probably do; you should probably get tested.”“If your symptoms aren’t life-threatening, simply stay at home, medicate with over-the-counter medicines, drink lots of water, get a lot of rest and check out the shows you want to binge-watch,” she said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/no-coronavirus-isnt-the-same-as-the-flu/,China firms see the UV light,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Aches and pains, sore throat, fever — although they may feel similar to those suffering from their symptoms, the novel coronavirus is not the same as the seasonal flu, experts stressed Wednesday.COVID-19, the illness caused by a coronavirus, proves deadly in around 3.5 percent of confirmed cases.While this is not the same as its mortality rate, given many people may be infected but not realize it, it is significantly higher than seasonal flu, which typically kills 0.1 percent of patients.“There is still considerable uncertainty around the fatality rates of COVID-19 and it likely varies depending on the quality of local healthcare,” said Francois Balloux, Professor of Computational Systems Biology at University College London.“That said, it is around two percent on average, which is about 20 times higher than for the seasonal flu lineages currently in circulation.”But the true danger of coronavirus is unlikely to be the death toll. Experts say health systems could easily become overwhelmed by the number of cases requiring hospitalization — and, often ventilation to support breathing.An analysis of 45,000 confirmed cases in China, where the epidemic originated, show that the vast majority of deaths were among the elderly (14.8 percent mortality among over 80s).But another Chinese study showed that 41 percent of serious cases occurred among under 50s, compared with 27 percent among over 65s.“It’s true that if you’re older you’re at greater risk, but serious cases can also happen in relatively young people with no prior conditions,” said French deputy health minister Jerome Salomon.Disease experts estimate that each COVID-19 sufferer infects between two to 3 others.That’s a reproduction rate up to twice as high as seasonal flu, which typically infects 1.3 new people for each patient.Salomon said that humans have lived with influenza for more than 100 years.“We’ve studied it closely,” he said. “This new virus resembles the flu in terms of physical symptoms but there are huge differences.”Number one is the lack of a vaccine against COVID-19, or even any treatment shown to be consistently effective.While some trials have shown promise delivering anti-retroviral drugs to serious cases, as well as some experimental therapies, their sample sizes are too small to roll out to the general population.Hundreds of researchers around the world are working frantically to find a COVID-19 vaccine, but the development process takes months and is likely too late for the current outbreak.Even if a vaccine magically appeared, getting everyone access it to it is no small order. Health authorities regularly complain that not enough people receive the flu vaccine to guarantee “herd immunity”.But the new virus does share some characteristics with flu, notably the measures each one of us can personally take to slow the infection rate:Avoid shaking hands, frequently wash your hands with soap and water, avoid touching your face and wear a mask if you are sick.Such actions can limit new infections just as they can with the flu, gastro illnesses and other infectious diseases.France’s health ministry says that only two in 10 people regularly wash their hands after using the bathroom.“And only 42 percent of people cover their mouth with an elbow or tissue when they cough or sneeze,” it added, not encouragingly.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/thirdhand-smoke-poses-health-risks-say-us-scientists/,‘Thirdhand’ smoke poses health risks,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The stale odor that announces a smoker’s entry into a room may be more than merely unpleasant.A new study by scientists at Yale University has found that compounds from tobacco smoke can infiltrate well-ventilated rooms by hitching a ride on peoples’ clothes, skin, and hair and then evaporating slowly over time in a process called “off-gassing.”By placing a high-tech air sampling device in the exhaust duct of a non-smoking movie theater in Germany, the researchers determined that so-called “thirdhand” smoke-exposed movie-goers to between one and 10 cigarettes of passive smoke, depending on the substance in question. Their paper was published in Science Advances on Wednesday.Secondhand smoke has been studied for decades and heightens people’s risks for heart conditions and lung cancer, though the exact level of risk has been contested in recent studies.There has also been an increasing interest into thirdhand smoke, but most studies have so far looked at rooms that were recently smoked in, rather than how people who were either smokers or had been around smokers impacted non-smoking indoor environments.The Yale team, led by Drew Gentner, an environmental engineer, examined a cinema in Mainz, Germany, that has had a smoking ban for 15 years — long enough for any pre-ban contaminants to clear out.Over the course of four days, they found the levels of 35 tobacco-related chemicals surged when audience members entered the theater.These included cancer-causing compounds like benzene and formaldehyde.The effects were particularly pronounced during R-rated films, like “Resident Evil,” which the authors suggested was because such movies attract older audiences more likely to have been exposed to smoke.“Our work establishes that there’s substantial transport of thirdhand smoke contaminants from people into a real-world non-smoking indoor environment,” said Gentner.He conceded that the precise level of health risks to others was beyond the scope of the current study and would depend on a variety of factors, including how often people were exposed to the chemicals and their proximity to the source of emissions.“Based on these results, it’s our hope that the work will generate much-needed discussion about thirdhand smoke, and that the research and policy will continue to evolve from those discussions,” he said.© Agence France-Presse"

As the novel coronavirus continues its spread across the globe, what does the designation mean to world healthcare systems as they try to rein in the deadly disease?The World Health Organization has yet to declare the current outbreak, which originated in central China last month, a pandemic.It has indicated however that we should prepare ourselves for one.The WHO defines a pandemic as a situation in which “the whole world’s population would likely be exposed to this infection and potentially a proportion of them fall sick,” said its emergencies director Michael Ryan.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that countries should be doing everything they could “to prepare for a potential pandemic”.“For the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus and we are not witnessing large-scale deaths,” he said on Monday.While the number of fresh cases in mainland China has slowed slightly in recent weeks, several other countries have seen infections mushroom.These include South Korea, which has seen more than 1,100 people infected, and Italy, with more than 300 confirmed cases.On Tuesday Iran reported four more deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 19 and confirmed infections to 139.“What we see are epidemics in different parts of the world, affecting countries in different ways and requiring a tailored response,” said Tedros.The WHO has not updated its designation of the outbreak since January 30, when it classed it as “a public health emergency of international concern”.Under its old warning system, which had six stages of alert, the WHO could simply start referring to coronavirus as a pandemic, which comes from the Ancient Greek for “pan demos”: all people.“Definitions and terminology aside, our advice remains the same,” said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic.For Bharat Pankhania, of the University of Exeter Medical School in England, coronavirus is already a pandemic “in all but name”.“It’s only a matter of time before the World Health Organisation starts to use the term in its communications,” he said.David Heymann, professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said the terminology risked being a distraction.“What is necessary is to understand the current situation in each country,” he said.Tedros did hint that designating the outbreak a pandemic prematurely might do more harm than good.“Using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear. This is not the time to focus on what word we use,” he said.He added that even if a pandemic is declared, the world alone “will not prevent a single infection today or save a single life today.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/most-coronavirus-infections-are-mild-says-chinese-study/,Pandemic: what does it mean and does it matter?,1,"BEIJING, China (AFP) — Most people infected by the new coronavirus in China have mild symptoms, with older patients and those with underlying conditions most at risk from the disease, according to a study by Chinese researchers.The disease has now killed nearly 1,900 people and infected more than 72,000 in China since it first emerged in the central city of Wuhan late last year.A paper published in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology looked at 72,314 confirmed, suspected, clinically diagnosed, and asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 illness across China as of February 11.It is the biggest study on novel coronavirus patients since the outbreak began in late December.Here are the main findings from the paper by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC): Some 80.9 percent of infections are classified as mild, 13.8 percent as severe and only 4.7 percent as critical.The highest fatality rate is for people aged 80 and older, at 14.8 percent.The study finds that patients with cardiovascular disease are most likely to die of complications from the novel coronavirus, followed by patients with diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and hypertension.There were no deaths among children aged up to 9, despite at least two cases of newborn babies infected through their mothers.Up to age 39, the death rate remains low at 0.2 percent.The fatality rate increases gradually with age. For people in their 40s it is 0.4 percent, in their 50s it is 1.3 percent, in their 60s it is 3.6 percent and their 70s it is 8.0 percent.Men are more likely to die (2.8 percent) than women (1.7 percent).The overall death rate from the virus stood at 2.3 percent. Nearly 86 percent of those who have contracted the illness had either lived in or travelled to Wuhan, where a seafood market that illegally sold wild animals is believed to be the original source of the virus.The city in central China’s Hubei province has been under lockdown since January 23.Risk to medical workers A total of 3,019 health workers have been diagnosed, 1,716 of whom were confirmed cases, and five had died as of February 11, the report said.An analysis of 1,688 severe cases among medical staff showed that 64 percent of them were working in Wuhan.“The percentage of severe cases among Wuhan medical staff has gradually decreased from 38.9 percent at the peak (on January 28) to 12.7 percent in early February,” the report said.A hospital director in Wuhan died from the illness on Tuesday.Earlier this month Wuhan ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, who had been punished by authorities for sounding the alarm about the virus, also died. The epidemic reached its “first peak” between January 24 and 26, the report said.It suggests there is has been a “downward trend” in the overall epidemic curve since February 11 — meaning the spread of the disease, especially outside Hubei province, was slowing.On February 13, China broadened its definition of confirmed cases to include those who were clinically diagnosed through lung imaging, in addition to those with a positive lab test result.The report hints that China’s decision to lock down Wuhan — a city of 11 million people — and impose strict transport curbs in other affected areas may have paid off. The virus spread as millions of people criss-crossed the country for the Lunar New Year holiday in late January.The authors warn that with many people returning from the holiday, the country needs to brace itself for a “possible rebound of the epidemic”.Coronaviruses may continue to “adapt over time and become more virulent”, the report warns and urges doctors to “remain vigilant”."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/uk-team-tests-novel-coronavirus-vaccine-on-mice/,Most coronavirus infections are mild,1,"LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — A team of British scientists believe they have become the first to start animal testing of a vaccine for the new coronavirus that has killed more than 900 people.Researchers at Imperial College London said their ultimate goal was to have an effective and safe way of halting the SARS-like strain’s spread by the end of the year.“At the moment we have just put the vaccine that we’ve generated from these bacteria into mice,” Imperial College London researcher Paul McKay told AFP in an interview on Monday.“We’re hoping that over the next few weeks we’ll be able to determine the response that we can see in those mice, in their blood, their antibody response to the coronavirus.”Scientists across the world are racing to develop a way to stamp out a new strain of a well-known virus that has been successfully combatted in the past.Britain’s has recorded eight cases and been forced to shut down two branches of a medical centre in the southeast city of Brighton where at least two staff members tested positive.But coming up with a vaccine is a laborious process that usually involves years of animal testing and clinal trials on humans.Regulators must then make sure that the vaccine is both sufficiently safe and effective to be mass produced.Imperial College London hopes that research on the SARS coronavirus nearly two decades ago can speed things up.“We’re hoping to be the first to get this particular vaccine into human clinical trials, and that perhaps is our personal goal,” McKay said.“Once the phase one trial is complete — which can take a few months to complete — it can be immediately started into an efficacy trial in people, which will also take a few months to complete,” McKay added.“So, perhaps by the end of this year there will be a viable tested vaccine that would be suitable for use in people.” Much of the world’s current research into the new strain is being funded through the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).The group was formed at the 2017 World Economic Forum in Davos to help drug companies and universities join forces and stamp out dangerous and preventable diseases.Imperial College London is not working with any of the current teams partnering with CEPI and requires its own sources of funding.Its scientists hope that successful animal testing can help secure investments that allow clinical trials to start some time between June and August.McKay said it would be unfair to say that the various universities and companies are competing to become the first to develop a vaccine.“There’s been so much cross-sharing with all of this information — I mean the Chinese, as soon as the genome was sequenced, they shared it freely with everyone in the world,” he noted.“So to put it in a competitive sense is probably not accurate. I would say that it’s a collaborative race.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/scientists-race-to-develop-vaccine-for-new-coronavirus/,says Chinese study,1,"SINGAPORE (AFP) — Scientists from the United States to Australia are using new technology in an ambitious, multi-million-dollar drive to develop a vaccine in record time to tackle China’s coronavirus outbreak.The new virus has spread rapidly since emerging late last year in China, killing more than 800 people in the mainland and infecting over 37,000. Cases have been reported in two dozen other countries.Coming up with any vaccine typically takes years, and involves a lengthy process of testing on animals, clinical trials on humans and regulatory approvals.But several teams of experts are racing to develop one quicker, backed by an international coalition that aims to combat emerging diseases, and Australian scientists hope theirs could be ready in six months.“It is a high-pressure situation and there is a lot of weight on us,” said senior researcher Keith Chappell, part of the group from Australia’s University of Queensland.But the scientist added he took “some solace” knowing several teams around the world were engaged in the same mission.“The hope is that one of these will be successful and can contain this outbreak,” he said.But even a timeframe of six months looks agonisingly slow with the virus, believed to have emerged from a market selling wild animals, killing close to 100 people every day in mainland China.Efforts are being led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a body established in 2017 to finance costly biotechnology research in the wake of an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people.With a mission to speed up the development of vaccines, CEPI is pouring millions of dollars into four projects around the world and has put out a call for more proposals. The projects hope to use new technology to develop vaccines that can be tested in the near future.The body’s CEO, Richard Hatchett, said the aim was to start clinical testing in just 16 weeks.German biopharmaceutical company CureVac and US-based Moderna Therapeutics are developing vaccines based on “messenger RNA” — instructions that tell the body to produce proteins — while Inovio, another American firm, is using DNA-based technology.DNA- and RNA-based vaccines use the genetic coding of the virus to trick the body’s cells into producing proteins identical to those on the surface of the pathogen, explained Ooi Eng Eong, deputy director of the emerging infectious diseases programme at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.The immune system learns to recognise the proteins so that it is ready to find and attack the virus when it enters the body.The Australian researchers are using “molecular clamp” technology invented by the university’s scientists that allows them to rapidly develop new vaccines based solely on a virus DNA sequence.French scientists at the Pasteur Institute are modifying the measles vaccine to work against the coronavirus, but do not expect it to be ready for about 20 months.Meanwhile, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has also started developing vaccines, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. Health authorities weigh the risks and benefits in vaccine approvals and if there is a public health emergency, the process could be shortened, said Ooi of the Duke-NUS Medical School.But he added that “paradoxically, if the situation improves, then actually the pathway for vaccines would be longer”.“If there’s a lot of these new coronavirus cases around, then you accept some risk, because of the tremendous amount of benefit you can derive, whereas if there are not many cases, the tolerance for risk would be very low.”While there is no vaccine for the coronavirus, some doctors are trying out a potent brew of anti-retroviral and flu drugs to treat those infected, but the science is inconclusive as to whether they are effective.Ultimately, scientists may end up in the same situation they were during the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) — it died out before a vaccine could be fully developed.A close cousin of the new coronavirus, SARS spread around the world and killed nearly 800.But Ong Siew Hwa, the director of Acumen Research Laboratories, a biotech company in Singapore, said efforts to develop a vaccine for the new virus should continue even if the outbreak ends.“I think a vaccine will definitely be important,” she said. “If it’s not in time for this round, it is important for the next time.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/pangolin-suspect-1-as-direct-source-of-coronavirus-outbreak/,UK team tests novel coronavirus vaccine on mice,1,"Chinese researchers investigating the animal origin of the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China said Friday the endangered pangolin may be the “missing link” between bats and humans, but other scientists said the search may not be over.An earlier study — since discredited — pointed to snakes, and there remain numerous candidate species in the Wuhan wildlife market thought to be ground zero of the epidemic.The SARS outbreak of 2002-3, involving a different strain of coronavirus, was transferred to humans by the civet, a small mammal prized in China for its flesh. Many animals are capable of transmitting viruses to other species, and nearly all strains of the coronavirus contagious to humans originated in wildlife.Bats are known carriers of the latest strain of the disease, which has infected at least 31,000 people and killed more than 630 worldwide, mostly in China where the outbreak originate.A recent genetic analysis showed that the strain of the virus currently spreading among humans was 96 percent identical to that found in bats.But according to Arnaud Fontanet, from France’s Pasteur Institute, the disease likely didn’t jump straight from bats to humans.“We think there’s another animal that’s an intermediary,” he told AFP.Several studies have shown that the bat-bourne virus lacks the necessary hardware to latch on to human cell receptors. But it’s still not clear which animal is the missing link.Fontanet believes the intermediary was “probably a mammal,” possible belonging to the badger family.After testing more than 1,000 samples from wild animals, scientists at the South China Agricultural University found the genome sequences of viruses in pangolins to be 99 percent identical to those on coronavirus patients, the official Xinhua news agency reported.But other experts urged caution.“This is not scientific evidence,” said James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge. “Investigations into animal reservoirs are extremely important, but results must be then be published for international scrutiny.”“Simply reporting detection of viral RNA with sequence similarity of 99+ percent is not sufficient,” he added. To conclusively identify the culprit, researchers would need to test each species that was on sale at the market — a near impossibility given that it’s now permanently closed.Martine Peeters, a virologist at France’s Institute for Research and Development (IRD), worked on the team that identified the host animal of the Ebola virus during recent epidemics.They found that it was indeed a bat that passed the virus on to humans, and Peeters believes that’s likely to be the case this time around.During her Ebola research, “we collected thousands of bat dropping from several sites in Africa,” Peeters told AFP.Fontanet said that Chinese researchers were doing likewise now.“They say they’ve analysed samples from a rubbish truck,” he said. “They don’t say which, but I think it’s likely to have been excrement that was just lying around.” While it may be too late for this outbreak, identifying the carrier animal for the novel coronavirus could prove vital in preventing future flare ups.China for example outlawed the sale of civet for food in the wake of the SARS epidemic.Eric Leroy, a virologist and vet at the IRD said the search could well turn up a result quickly like in the case of SARS. Equally, it could take years.“With Ebola, research started in 1976 and we didn’t see the first results published until 2005,” he told AFP.One determining factor could be what percentage of the same species are infected.“If that’s low, less than one percent for example, that’s obviously going to lower the chance you stumble upon an infected animal,” said Leroy. For Fontanet, coronavirus is just the latest example of the potentially disastrous consequence of humans consuming virus-carrying wild animals.He said that China needed to “take pretty radical measures against the sale of wild animals in markets.”Beijing has prohibited the practice, but only moved to do so last month, when the outbreak was already out of control.“Each time, we try to put out the fire, and once it’s out we await the next one,” said Francois Renaud, a researcher at the Paris-based National Centre for Scientific Research.He recommended compiling a watch list of all animals that could potentially transmit viruses to humans.“You need to see epidemics before they come, and therefore you need to be proactive,” he said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/massive-genome-study-unlocks-secrets-of-how-cancers-form/,Scientists race to develop vaccine for new coronavirus,1,", (AFP) — A massive, decade-long study sequencing the genomes of dozens of cancers has revealed the secrets of how tumors form and may pave the way for better and more targeted treatment.The brought together over 1,300 researchers globally to tackle the mammoth task of sequencing the genomes of 38 types of cancer in nearly 2,800 patients.Their work produced a host of new discoveries — from the number and location of so-called driver mutations that push cells to reproduce uncontrollably, to the surprising similarities between cancers found in different types of tissue.The results were published Thursday in nearly two dozen papers in Nature and other Nature Research journals and represent the largest and most comprehensive study of whole cancer genomes ever.“With the knowledge we have gained about the origins and evolution of tumors, we can develop new tools and therapies to detect cancer earlier, develop more targeted therapies and treat patients more successfully,” said Lincoln Stein, a member of the project steering committee, in a statement issued by the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research.Among the key findings of the work is the massive variety in cancer genomes, said Peter Campbell of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, another steering committee member.“The most striking finding is just how different one person’s cancer genome is from another person’s,” he told AFP.The study found thousands of combinations of mutations in individual cancers, as well as over 80 processes that cause the mutations, some of them age-related and others inherited or linked to lifestyle factors such as smoking.But within the enormous variety there were “exciting themes”, Campbell said.For example, the work found the early development of some cancers can occur decades before diagnosis, sometimes even in childhood.“This shows that the window of opportunity for early intervention is much wider than we expected,” Campbell said.The research also found that patterns of mutations, and where they occur, can help identify the approximately 1-5 percent of cancers that cannot be identified through regular diagnostics.A sequenced genome can even reveal occasional misdiagnosis of a cancer type.Most work on sequencing the cancer genome has focused on the approximately two percent known as the protein-coding genes.But the Pan-Cancer Study sequenced entire genomes, uncovering new cancer-causing driver mutations in the other 98 percent, known as non-coding genes.The researchers found enormous variation in the number of mutations in a given cancer, from very few in some cancers seen in children, to up to 100,000 in lung cancer samples.And in around five percent of cases, no known driver mutations were found at all, implying there are mutations that have not yet been identified.The sequencing helps map out the many types of mutations — from changes in single DNA letters to much larger insertions or deletions of genetic code — that can cause cancer.It also revealed that cancers in different parts of the body are sometimes much more alike than had been thought.“We may have a type of breast cancer and prostate cancer where the driver mutations are similar,” said Joachim Weischenfeldt, a co-author and associate professor at the University of Copenhagen.“This means that the patient with prostate cancer may benefit from the same treatment as the one you would give the breast cancer patient,” he said in a statement issued by the university.In practical terms, the findings will help identify difficult-to-diagnose cancers, allow more targeted treatment based on the specific driver mutations behind a particular cancer, and potentially allow earlier diagnosis of developing tumors.“We are finding that cancer represents the far end of an enormous spectrum of change,” said Campbell.“If we can understand the forces at play in our normal organs as we age, what causes mutations to accumulate, what causes some clones to expand and others to fade, what lifestyles do to tilt this balance, then we can think about ways to intervene early, with a view to preventing or slowing the emergence of untreatable cancers.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/hiv-drugs-touted-as-weapon-in-war-on-coronavirus/,Pangolin Suspect #1 as direct source of coronavirus outbreak,1,"BANGKOK, Thailand (AFP) — As doctors scramble to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus, a potent brew of anti-retroviral and flu drugs has emerged as a possible defence against the mysterious sickness that has killed hundreds.But the science is inconclusive on whether they are actually effective and experts say successful treatment could take years.Here is what we know — and don’t know — about the drugs deployed against the SARS-like virus. Patients diagnosed with the common flu are often prescribed an antiviral drug widely known as Tamiflu.But the seasonal flu is “very different from the Chinese coronavirus”, said Sylvie van der Werf at the Paris-based Pasteur Institute.So far, the new coronavirus has infected tens of thousands worldwide and killed more than 420 people mostly in mainland China.Two weeks ago Chinese doctors confirmed they had been giving anti-HIV drugs to coronavirus patients in Beijing, based on a 2004 study during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, that showed “favourable” responses.Used together, lopinavir and ritonavir decrease the amount of HIV cells in a patient’s blood, stripping back the virus’s ability to reproduce and attack the immune system.Doctors have also combined the treatment with another anti-flu drug called oseltamivir, hoping the creative cocktail can sap the new coronavirus of its strength.In Thailand, where there are 19 confirmed cases, a 71-year-old Chinese patient returned a negative test within 48 hours of being given the three drugs.But Thai doctors cautioned the medicine needed to be given under supervision due to possible side effects or it clashing with pre-existing medications. In short, we don’t know for sure.The 2004 study showed anti-retrovirals used on patients with SARS had “substantial clinical benefits”, experts in China said.But random trials on 41 coronavirus patients had “limitations”, according to the research, which was published in medical journal The Lancet on January 24.The researchers were not able to obtain complete samples from the patients’ lower respiratory tract — which is suspected to be the target site of the new coronavirus — and there were not enough patients to verify results.“Further studies in outpatient, primary care, or community settings are needed to get a full picture,” they wrote. Biotech firms are working on a suite of treatment options.California-based Gilead Sciences said they are working with Chinese authorities on clinical trials to determine if remdesivir — a drug used to treat SARS — is effective against the new coronavirus.Meanwhile three teams around the world — in China, Australia and the Pasteur Institute in France — have now succeeded in cultivating the new coronavirus in the laboratory.That could lead to pinpointing its “Achilles’ heel” by understanding how it replicates in cells, said Christophe d’Enfert, the institute’s scientific director.But as of now there is no specific treatment against it, World Health Organization spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said.“More investigations and analysis of the epidemiological data is still required,” he told AFP. The best approach for the general public is to try and “stay healthy” so your immune system can offer a robust response to the threat of the virus, said Singapore’s health minister Gan Kim Yong.But for already infected patients, hospitals must provide supportive care to prevent complications.“Chances are if you already have underlying medical conditions… your defences are weak and your organs may already be impaired, and therefore the risk of death is higher,” he told parliament Monday.Developing a successful solution may take months or years, he added. But misinformation has proliferated online about home and traditional remedies.A liquid made with honeysuckle and flowering plants used in traditional medicine was initially claimed to “inhibit” the virus, sparking frenzied buying in China.But Chinese state media later sounded a more cautionary note, as researchers warned of potential side effects from the medicine.In India, where there are three reported confirmed cases, the government has touted ancient homeopathy and Ayurveda remedies as the answer.The jury is out on the effectiveness, and doctors still recommended that patients be treated in a hospital.Online posts erroneously identified saline — basic salt water — as a coronavirus killer in Australia, while in Thailand social media touted that an antiseptic should be sprayed in a person’s mouth.The antiseptic company Betadine has refuted the claim."

On Sunday the Philippines reported the first death outside of China.Researchers at the state-run academy, a top government think tank, are also studying the potential use of a plant commonly known as Japanese knotweed to alleviate symptoms.The National Health Commission on Tuesday said TCM practitioners were among nearly 6,000 reinforcement medical personnel being sent to Wuhan in Hubei province, ground zero of the outbreak.The strategy has reignited a fierce and long-running debate about the efficacy of TCM, which has a history going back 2,400 years and remains popular in modern-day China.Marc Freard, a member of the Chinese Medicine Academic Council of France, told AFP he believed traditional formulations could be used to treat people with symptoms ranging from fever to thick phlegm.But he warned that many remedies on the market were of questionable quality and admitted that TCM “lacks scientific standards of efficacy” because it relied on “individualized treatment”.Traditional medicines were widely used in China in conjunction with Western methods during the 2003 epidemic of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed 774 people worldwide.But a 2012 study in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews found combining Chinese and Western medicines “made no difference” in battling the disease.The Chinese government has increasingly promoted traditional medicine abroad in recent years, often with nationalistic undertones.Beijing issued its first white paper on TCM in 2016, laying out plans to build medicine centers and dispatch practitioners to developing countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.President Xi Jinping has called TCM a “treasure of Chinese civilization” and said at a meeting in October that it should be given as much weight as other treatments.China is “working hard to spread the message internationally about its traditional culture”, and medicine is a part of this, Freard said.In 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) even added Chinese medicine to its “International Classification of Diseases” — a reference document for medical trends and global health statistics — after years of campaigning by Beijing.But the move was slammed by members of the scientific community, with the European Academies’ Science Advisory Council calling the decision “a major problem” due to the lack of evidence-based practice.The WHO did not immediately respond to AFP’s request for comment.Fang Shimin, a prominent writer in China known for his campaigns against academic fraud, told AFP he believes the government’s promotion of traditional medicine “panders to nationalism and has nothing to do with science”.It is an enormous industry in China worth more than $130 billion in 2016 — a third of the country’s entire medical industry — according to state news agency Xinhua.© Agence France-Presse"

Judging from the work across the country, the epidemic is still in its early stages of spread,” he noted.China’s Deputy Director of the National Health Committee and Member of the Party Group Li Bin admitted that they still have “limited knowledge” about the virus, and the progress of the epidemic is not within their control.“From our understanding, this disease is a new disease, and humans have limited knowledge of it. It is not clear about the possible changes in the disease, and the progress of the epidemic is not fully controlled in our hands,” he said.“The epidemic situation is constantly changing, policies are continuously adjusted, measures are perfected, and various prevention and control requirements are implemented. In this way, we can be fully prepared to continuously improve our ability to respond to changes in the epidemic, effectively achieve prevention and control goals, and control the epidemic,” Li said.The number of confirmed new cases was at least 7,783 worldwide, based on the data from the nCoV 2019 database of the John Hopkins University. Total deaths have reached 170, all in China.The National Health Commission in China said that while the main route of transmission is respiratory, the mechanism of transmission and the virus’ mutation are still not clear.“Judging from the epidemic situation, the main route is respiratory transmission. Our knowledge of the new coronavirus is still very limited, the source of infection has not been found, the mechanism of transmission and the mutation of the virus are unclear,” NHC director Ma said.He said that clinical epidemiological data also showed that the virus has began to adapt to “survive in humans” as it entered the human-to-human transmission phase.“Judging from the clinical epidemiological data, it was initially understood that the virus may have changed from wild animals to humans in the early days, and now it gradually began to adapt to survive in humans and enter the period of human-to-human transmission. From the current clinical cases, there are In some severe cases and some mild cases, the virus has begun to spread from person to person,” he explained.“According to recent clinical data, the transmission of the virus seems to have increased, and the toxicity and pathogenicity of the virus need to be analyzed based on more clinical data,” he added.A report from the Wall Street Journal said that “many of the first patients who died were over 60 years old.” It said few children have been reported with the infection."

Courtesy Agence France Presse) (Eagle News) — The 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019 nCOV can easily spread from human to human, and the transmission can be via “aerosol droplets in the air released by sneezing or coughing” or by touching a surface which has the virus.”In this videographics provided by , it shows that the virus is “most contagious when there is close contact: a family home, a hospital bed or any place where an individual is less than a meter from an infected person coughing or sneezing.”“It can also spread by touching a surface on which the virus is present, followed by contact with the mouth, nose or eyes,” it said.The virus can even survive for days in a humid environment, it said, for example through droplets.“Otherwise, its life is about three hours,” it said.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that while the nCov 2019 is a “very serious public health threat, based on current information, the immediate health risk” to the general American public is “very low at this time.”AFP data based on research said that “the risk of catching the virus after touching an object imported from China is therefore extremely low.”“Like all viruses it cannot survive at high temperatures, so there’s no risk in eating well-cooked meat. It cannot be transmitted by water,” it said.“At present there is no indication it can be passed on via sexual relations,” it said.“Basic precautions – washing you hands regularly, cleaning widely used domestic surfaces and sneezing into a paper handkerchief that is then thrown away, call all be efficient,” it added.Current data showed that the nCoV 2019 is highly contagious and has an incubation period between 2 to 10 days.On Monday, WHO estimated an incubation period of two to ten days.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/turn-back-time-how-quitting-smoking-reverses-lung-cell-damage/,Turn back time: how quitting smoking reverses lung cell damage,1,"TOKYO, Japan (AFP) — Smokers can effectively turn back time in their lungs by kicking the habit, with healthy cells emerging to replace some of their tobacco-damaged and cancer-prone ones, a new study shows.Smokers have long been told their risk of developing diseases like lung cancer will fall if they can quit, and stopping smoking prevents new damage to the body.But a study published Thursday in the journal Nature found that the benefits may go further, with the body appearing to draw on a reservoir of healthy cells to replace smoke-damaged ones in the lungs of smokers when they quit.The study’s joint senior author, Peter Campbell of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said the results should give new hope to smokers who want to quit.“People who have smoked heavily for 30, 40 or more years often say to me that it’s too late to stop smoking — the damage is already done,” he said in a statement issued by the institute.“What is so exciting about our study is that it shows that it’s never too late to quit.”Some of the people in the study had smoked more than 15,000 packs of cigarettes in their life, he said.“But within a few years of quitting, many of the cells lining their airways showed no evidence of damage from tobacco.”The study analyzed lung biopsies from 16 people, including current smokers, ex-smokers, adults who had never smoked and children, looking for mutations that can lead to cancer.Genetic changes that appear in the body’s cells are a normal part of aging, and many of these mutations are harmless so-called “passenger mutations”.But a mutation in the wrong gene in the wrong cell can “dramatically change the behavior of the cells and instruct them to behave more like cancer”, Campbell told AFP.“If enough of these ‘driver mutations’ accumulate, then the cell will become full-blown cancer.”The study found nine out of every 10 lung cells in current smokers had mutations, including those that can cause cancer.But in ex-smokers, many of those damaged cells had been replaced by healthy ones akin to those seen in people who had never smoked.Up to 40 percent of the total lung cells in ex-smokers were healthy, four times more than in their still-smoking counterparts.Campbell said the damaged cells had not been able to “magically repair themselves”.“Rather they are replaced by healthy cells that have escaped the damage from cigarette smoke.”The precise mechanism by which that replacement occurs is not yet clear, but the study’s authors believe there may be a sort of reservoir of cells, waiting for a chance to emerge.“Once the person quits smoking, the cells gradually proliferate from this safe harbor to replace the damaged cells,” Campbell told AFP.Gerd P. Pfeifer, professor at the Van Andel Institute’s Center for Epigenetics, praised the study in a review published by Nature.“It has shed light on how the protective effect of smoking cessation plays out at the molecular level in human lung tissue,” wrote Pfeifer, who was not involved in the study.Obtaining lung biopsies raises ethical concerns, meaning the researchers could only study 16 samples obtained from patients who had to undergo biopsies for separate medical reasons.The small sample size could provide a caveat to the study’s findings, Pfeifer wrote.But it “raises many interesting questions worthy of further investigation”.Campbell said the key now would be to locate the reservoir of healthy cells and work out how they are able to replace damaged ones.“If we can work out where they normally live and what makes them expand when someone stops smoking, perhaps we have opportunities to make them even more effective at repair.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/cdc-faces-challenge-of-coronavirus-outbreak-in-us/,CDC faces challenge of Coronavirus outbreak in US,1,"WASHINGTON, DC (Eagle News) – The latest and primary concern in the international and domestic medical world today is the rapid outbreak of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. From its origin in Wuhan, China, the virus, scientifically named 2019-nCoV, has spread to about 18 locations around the world including Europe and the United States. Most of those who have been infected were associated with travel from Wuhan, China. Early on, a majority of the cases were suspected to be “animal to person” spread. Eventually, there were reported cases of “person to person” spread. The source of the virus is still being researched thoroughly and systematically by public health organizations.Coronavirus is a respiratory illness. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website , it is a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals.Animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people, just like a regular cold or flu. Earlier respiratory illness cases caused by the coronavirus in Wuhan, China were attributed to having some link to large seafood and live animal markets. In the most recent cases, however, health officials have learned that those infected had no exposure to animal markets – a strong indication of that the virus was spreading by person-to-person contact.General symptoms include:Symptoms of the 2019-nCoV may manifest from 2 to 14 days after exposure. This is based on what has been previously observed with the MERS virus. There is currently no vaccine for this virus.According to the CDC, there is a growing number of countries who have confirmed cases of this virus. The list includes China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Australia, Cambodia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Thailand, The Republic of Korea, Vietnam and the United States.As of this writing, in the United States, there are currently five confirmed cases; one in Washington State, two in California, one in Arizona, and one in Chicago. In all, the CDC is investigating 110 cases across 26 states.There is currently no vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. Containing this outbreak and preventing exposure to the virus is, right now, the best way to prevent infection. CDC is recommending that everyone do their part to help them respond to this emerging public health threat by doing the following:On January 27, 2020, CDC issued travel guidance for China, recommending that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to all of the country (Level 3 Travel Health Notice).Teams have been deployed to US locations to assist health departments with clinical management, contact tracing and communications. According to the CDC, there is currently a real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test being implemented at CDC but is expected to be shared with other domestic and international partners."

WHO will keep working side-by-side with China and all other countries to protect health and keep people safe,” he added.On Jan. 10, Chinese scientists posted the 2019 novel coronavirus’ genetic makeup on a public database, enabling other countries’ scientists and experts to study it and try to develop a vaccine for the virus.They include researchers at the National Institutes of Health’s Vaccine Research Center in Maryland who, within hours were able to pinpoint the “genetic code that could be used to make a vaccine,” according to New York Times report.The WHO delegation said that it highly appreciated the actions that China has so far implemented in response to the outbreak, including “its speed in identifying the virus and openness to sharing information with WHO and other countries.”In the WHO meeting with China’s President Xi, Dr Tedros was joined by WHO Regional Director Dr Takeshi Kasai and Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme Dr Mike Ryan. They also met China’s State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi and Minister of Health Ma Xiaowei.WHO said that China’s National Health Commission presented the country’s strong public health capacities and resources to respond and manage respiratory disease outbreaks.“The discussions focused on continued collaboration on containment measures in Wuhan, public health measures in other cities and provinces, conducting further studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus, continuing to share data, and for China to share biological material with WHO,” a statement from WHO said.“These measures will advance scientific understanding of the virus and contribute to the development of medical countermeasures such as vaccines and treatments,” it said.The WHO mission comes as the number of people confirmed with the virus rose to over 4500 globally, most of which are in China. So far, the death toll has reached 132, all also in China.“Much remains to be understood about 2019-nCoV. The source of the outbreak and the extent to which it has spread in China are not yet known. While the current understanding of the disease remains limited, most cases reported to date have been milder, with around 20% of those infected experiencing severe illness,” it said.WHO and China both said that the number of cases being reported on nCoV infections, including those outside China, are “deeply concerning.”“Better understanding of the transmissibility and severity of the virus is urgently required to guide other countries on appropriate response measures,” said the WHO statement from Beijing."

The process would take three months to start the first trial, three more months to gather data, before being able to move into its second phase, and is being undertaken by the biotech firm Moderna.“But we are proceeding as if we will have to deploy a vaccine,” said Fauci. “In other words, we’re looking at the worst scenario that this becomes a bigger outbreak.”China was severely criticized for its handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-03, which claimed hundreds of lives, mostly on the mainland and in Hong Kong.During that health emergency, scientists had begun to develop a vaccine, but it was never deployed, Fauci said. Separately, the chief scientific officer of Johnson & Johnson told AFP that his company was also developing a vaccine.“We will utilize the same technology that was used in the development and manufacture of Johnson & Johnson’s Ebola vaccine which is currently deployed in DRC and Rwanda,” said Paul Stofells. It is “the same technology was also used to construct our Zika and HIV vaccine candidates.”US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the United States has offered China assistance three times in dealing with the crisis — so far without success.This would be necessary so that “we can see raw data, raw evidence and help design the types of studies and analytics” to answer critical questions such as incubation period and whether the infection can be transmitted while patients don’t have symptoms.“We are urging China — more cooperation and transparency are the most important steps you can take toward a more effective response,” Azar told reporters.But the World Health Organization announced later Tuesday that China had agreed to allow a team of international experts into the country to work with their Chinese counterparts.China was quick to sequence the genome of the 2019 novel Coronavirus and make it public, allowing scientists around the world to develop diagnostic tools and winning praise for its efforts, in contrast to the SARS outbreak."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-says-global-risk-of-china-virus-is-high/,US developing vaccine against deadly China virus: officials,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization on Monday said the global risk from the deadly virus in China was “high”, admitting an error in its previous reports that said it was “moderate”.The UN health body said in a situation report published late Sunday that the risk was “very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level.”In a footnote, the WHO said there had been an “error” in previous communications published on Thursday, Friday and Saturday which “incorrectly” said the global risk was “moderate”.Asked for more detail, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said only that it was “an error in the wording”.The WHO on Thursday stopped short of declaring the virus an international public health emergency — a rare designation used only for the most severe outbreaks that could trigger more concerted international action.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is visiting China this week to discuss further action to contain the virus, on Thursday said: “This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency”.WHO’s cautious approach can be seen in the context of past criticism over its slow or too hasty use of the term, first used for the deadly 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.During that outbreak, the UN health agency was criticised for sparking panic-buying of vaccines with its announcement that year that the outbreak had reached pandemic proportions, and then anger when it turned out the virus was not nearly as dangerous as first thought.But then in 2014, the WHO met harsh criticism for dragging its feet and downplaying the severity of the Ebola epidemic that ravaged three west Africa countries, claiming more than 11,300 lives by the time it ended in 2016."

Later in the day, 323 new cases were addedThere are 11 countries and territories in Asia with confirmed coronavirus cases led by China where the infections originated. Two are Chinese territories, Hong Kong and Macau, which also had two confirmed cases each. The others are Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.Malaysia was the most recent Asian country to add to the growing list.Recently, there were two confirmed cases reported in France — the first coronavirus infection in Europe — while a second confirmed case was reported in the US, particularly in Chicago. Earlier, the first confirmed case in the US, a man living near Seattle is now reported to be in good condition.Australia also said it has confirmed its first case of coronavirus.Here is the updated list of countries that have confirmed cases of the so-called coronavirus based on data from As of Friday, more than 800 people have been infected across China, with 177 in serious condition. Authorities were also examining 1,072 suspected case.Officials also confirmed the second virus death outside the Wuhan region, saying a patient died in Heilongjiang province, 2,000 kilometres (1,200 miles) to the northeast.— The city of , a gambling hub hugely popular with mainland tourists, has confirmed two cases. The first was a 52-year-old businesswoman from Wuhan who arrived in Macau by high-speed rail on Sunday, via the neighbouring city of Zhuhai.— As of Thursday, two people have tested positive in . Both had visited Wuhan in recent days and are being treated in isolation wards in hospital. Japan’s health authorities confirmed a second case on Friday, Kyodo news agency reported, saying the patient was a man in his 40s who was originally from Wuhan and on a trip to Japan.On January 16, Japan’s health ministry said they had its first case — a man who had visited Wuhan and was hospitalised on January 10, four days after his return to Japan.Nepal’s health authorities on Friday confirmed their first case — a 32-year-old man arriving from Wuhan, China. It is the first South Asian country to report the deadly disease.The patient, who was initially quarantined, recovered and was discharged. The government said that surveillance has been increased at the airport “and suspicious patients entering Nepal are being monitored.” Singapore on Friday announced two more confirmed cases of the new SARS-like virus, bringing the total number to three.The health ministry confirmed the first case Thursday — a 66-year-old man who arrived from Wuhan with his 37-year-old son, who also tested positive for the coronavirus.Both had arrived in Singapore on Monday.The third confirmed case is a 52-year-old Wuhan woman, who arrived in the city-state on Tuesday, and was admitted to hospital the following day. South Korea confirmed on Friday its second case of the virus.The health ministry said a South Korean man in his 50s started experiencing symptoms while working in Wuhan on Jan 10. He was tested his return earlier this week, and the virus was confirmed.The country reported its first case on January 20 — a 35-year-old woman who flew in from Wuhan. On January 22, authorities confirmed the first case on the self-ruled island of Taiwan — a Taiwanese woman in her fifties, living in Wuhan, who returned to the island on Monday with symptoms including fever, coughing and a sore throat. Thailand has detected four cases so far — three Chinese nationals from Wuhan and a 73-year-old Thai woman who came back from the Chinese city this month.Two of the Chinese patients were treated, cured and have travelled back to their country, the Thai health ministry said this week. Vietnam confirmed two cases of the virus on Thursday. An infected man from Wuhan travelled to Ho Chi Minh City earlier this month and passed the virus onto his son.Both are being treated hospital and are stable, Vietnam health officials said. On January 21, the United States announced its first case — a man in his 30s living near Seattle. Officials say he is in a good condition and approached authorities himself after reading about the virus in news reports.On Friday, Jan. 24, a second case was announced – a woman in her 60s living in Chicago. Both were treated and are recovering.On Friday two cases were confirmed in France, the first in Europe. One was in Paris while the other was in the city of Bordeaux, the country’s health minister said. Both had traveled to China and both were placed in isolation. Australia on Saturday confirmed its first case of the virus, a man who arrived in Melbourne from China a week ago. Authorities said they were contacting people who had travelled on the same plane from China and offering advice."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/what-we-know-so-far-about-the-new-china-virus/,UPDATED: Countries with confirmed cases of coronavirus increase,1,"As China locks down the city at the epicentre of a new viral outbreak, countries around the world are scrambling to prevent the spread of the deadly disease.Here’s what we know so far about the illness that has killed 17 people and infected at least 570, mostly in Wuhan: The pathogen appears to be a never-before-seen strain of coronavirus — a family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong between 2002 and 2003.The new virus has been named “2019-nCoV”. Most patients experience flu-like symptoms, including fever, a cough, shortness of breath, a sore throat or runny nose. It may have originated in bats, according to genetic analysis, but researchers say there could have been an “intermediate host” in the transmission to humans that one study suggested could have been snakes.Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Wednesday the virus likely came from “wild animals at a seafood market” in Wuhan.The market offered a range of exotic wildlife for sale, including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf pups, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat.SARS was linked to Chinese consumption of civet meat. China has confirmed the virus is passing from person to person without any contact with the now-closed market.While most patients are in Wuhan, cases have been detected across China and a few abroad.Nathalie MacDermott of King’s College London said it seems likely the virus is spreading through droplets in the air from sneezing or coughing.Scientists at Imperial College London published an estimate on Wednesday that 4,000 people had been infected in Wuhan — around 10 times the official figure. The symptoms appear to be less aggressive than those of the virus that spread in 2002 and 2003.However, Antoine Flahault, director of the Institute of Global Health at the University of Geneva, told AFP the fact that the virus seems milder in the majority of people is “paradoxically more worrying” as it allows many to travel further before their symptoms are detected.The 17 patients who died were between 48 and 89 years old. Most had underlying health issues including cirrhosis, diabetes, high blood pressure or coronary heart disease, China’s National Health Commission said.Fears of a bigger epidemic have risen as hundreds of millions of people travel across the country for China’s Lunar New Year holiday, which starts Friday. The World Health Organization on Wednesday postponed its decision on whether to declare a global public health emergency, extending talks by a day.It has only used the rare label a handful of times, including during the H1N1 — or swine flu — pandemic of 2009 and the Ebola epidemic that devastated parts of West Africa from 2014 to 2016.Cases have so far been confirmed in Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Macau and the United States.The Chinese government said Tuesday it was classifying the outbreak in the same category as SARS, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed and the potential to implement quarantine measures on travel. Authorities halted flights and trains out of Wuhan from Thursday and told people in the city they should not leave without a special reason.In Thailand, officials have introduced mandatory thermal scans of passengers arriving at airports in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Krabi from high-risk areas in China.In Hong Kong, authorities have said they are on high alert, carrying out scans at the city’s airport — one of the world’s busiest — and at other international land and sea crossing points. High-speed rail tickets to Wuhan are no longer being sold while airliner Cathay has said it will stop flights to the city until 29 February.Taiwan has issued travel advisories and went to its second-highest alert level for Wuhan, recommending against all travel to the city.South Korea urged its citizens on Thursday not to travel to Wuhan, with the foreign ministry telling anyone intending to visit the area to “please carefully review the necessity of the trip”.The US has also ordered the screening of passengers arriving on direct or connecting flights from Wuhan, including at airports in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.In Europe, Britain and Italy introduced enhanced monitoring of flights from Wuhan, while Romania and Russia are also strengthening checks."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/how-the-new-coronavirus-developed/,What we know so far about the new China virus,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — A new coronavirus, a mysterious SARS-like disease, has spread around China and three other Asian countries since first emerging in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.A timeline: The World Health Organization (WHO) is alerted on December 31, 2019, by the Chinese authorities of a string of pneumonia-like cases in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people.Patients are quarantined and work begins on identifying the origin of the pneumonia.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies a seafood market suspected to be at the centre of the outbreak. It is closed on January 1, 2020. On January 9, the WHO says that the outbreak in Wuhan was caused by a previously unknown type of coronavirus, which is a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like SARS. The Chinese health authorities say a first person has died of the virus on January 11. They revise downwards the number of sick people to 41. On January 13, the virus spreads beyond China’s borders for the first time with a case emerging in Thailand, according to the WHO. The victim is a Chinese woman diagnosed with mild pneumonia who was returning from a trip to Wuhan.On January 15 China’s health commission says no human-to-human transmission of the virus behind the Wuhan outbreak has been confirmed so far, but the possibility “cannot be excluded”.The next day a first case of the virus is confirmed in Japan in someone who had stayed in Wuhan in early January. On January 17, a second person, a 69-year-old man, dies in Wuhan, according to the authorities.The same day, the CDC announces that it will begin screening passengers arriving from Wuhan at three airports: San Francisco, New York’s JFK and Los Angeles. On January 20, a third death and more than 100 new cases are announced in China, sparking concerns ahead of the annual Lunar New Year holiday which begins January 25 and sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel nationwide.The virus is present in Beijing in the north, Shanghai in the east and Shenzhen in the south. More than 200 cases have been recorded. The virus is also detected in South Korea in a Chinese person who has arrived by plane from Wuhan.China’s President Xi Jinping says that the virus must be “resolutely contained”, in his first public comments on the outbreak.Human-to-human transmission is “affirmative”, a top Chinese expert on infectious diseases Zhong Nanshan tells state broadcaster CCTV. On January 22 European airports from London to Moscow step up checks on flights from Wuhan.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says he is postponing a decision on whether or not to declare a global health emergency.“I have decided to ask the emergency committee to meet again tomorrow to continue their discussion,” he said, referring to a group of international experts who met for several hours at the WHO in Geneva on Wednesday.As Chinese authorities say 17 people have died and more than 500 have been infected, air and rail departures from Wuhan are suspended from January 23."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/studies-suggest-role-of-bats-snakes-in-outbreak-of-china-virus/,How the new coronavirus developed,1,"TOKYO, Japan (AFP) — A new strain of coronavirus that emerged in China may have originated in bats or snakes, according to genetic analysis of the virus that has so far killed 17 people.The theories are based on examination of the genome sequence of the virus released by authorities in the wake of the outbreak, with two studies pointing to the likely role of bats in the outbreak.One study, published Tuesday in the journal Science China Life Sciences, which is sponsored by Beijing’s Chinese Academy of Sciences, looked at the relations between the new strain and other viruses.It found the coronavirus that emerged from China’s Wuhan was closely related to a strain that exists in bats.“Bats being the native host of the Wuhan CoV (coronavirus) would be the logical and convenient reasoning, though it remains likely there was the intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans,” the researchers from several institutions in China wrote in the paper.That study did not speculate about which animal could have been an “intermediate host,” but a second study published Wednesday in the Journal of Medical Virology identifies snakes as the possible culprit.“To search for (a) potential virus reservoir, we have carried out a comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison. Results from our analysis suggest that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir,” the paper says.The researchers caution that their conclusions require “further validation by experimental studies in animal models”.Neither study explained how the virus may have been transmitted from animals to humans.But they could offer clues to Chinese authorities as they hunt for the source of the outbreak that has sickened hundreds of people in the country and has been confirmed as far afield as the United States.The food market where the deadly virus surfaced offered a range of exotic wildlife for sale, including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game.Gao Fu, director of the Chinese center for disease control and prevention, said in Beijing on Wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from “wild animals at the seafood market” though the exact source remains undetermined.Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, was linked to the Chinese consumption of civet meat.Many exotic species are still widely consumed in China or other Asian countries where they are considered a delicacy — like the civet or some rats or bats — or for purported health benefits unproven by science.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-confirms-first-case-of-china-virus-as-death-toll-reaches-six/,Studies suggest role of bats,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The United States on Tuesday announced its first case of a new virus that has claimed six lives in China and sickened hundreds, joining countries around the world in ramping up measures to block its spread.The man, a US resident in his 30s who lives near Seattle, is in good condition, according to federal and state officials, and approached authorities himself after reading about the SARS-like infection in news reports.He is “currently hospitalized out of an abundance of precaution, and for short term monitoring, not because there was severe illness,” said Chris Spitters, a Washington state health official.“This is an evolving situation and again, we do expect additional patients in the United States and globally,” added Nancy Messonier, a senior official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). She stressed that the overall risk to Americans remained low.The man is originally from Wuhan and returned to the US on January 15, two days before health officials began screening passengers at major airports arriving from the central Chinese city, which is at the heart of the outbreak. The efforts are to be extended now to a total of five US airports.He lives alone and will be monitored in isolation for at least 48 more hours.The development came as countries intensified their efforts to stop the spread of the pathogen — known by its technical name 2019 Novel Coronavirus — as the number of cases surpassed 300, raising concerns in the middle of a major Chinese holiday travel rush.Fears of a bigger outbreak rose after a prominent expert from China’s National Health Commission confirmed late Monday that the virus can be passed between people.That conclusion is shared by the CDC, which said “person-to-person spread is occurring, although it’s unclear how easily the virus spreads between people.”The World Health Organization (WHO) will hold an emergency meeting Wednesday to determine whether to declare a rare global public health emergency over the disease, which has also been detected in Thailand, Japan and South Korea and Taiwan.Many experts believe the US case, while not surprising given the frequency of international flights, makes such a declaration all the more likely.Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said more evidence was needed to determine if it spreads through the air or via close human-to-human contact.“It is important to stress that, though similar, it is not as severe an infection as its predecessor, the SARS coronavirus,” he added. Early on, many patients had some link to a Wuhan seafood market where live animals were sold, suggesting an animal-to-person spread.Hundreds of millions of people are criss-crossing China this week in packed buses, trains and planes to celebrate the Lunar New Year with relatives.More than 80 new cases have been confirmed, bringing the total number of people hit by the virus in China to 315, with the vast majority in Hubei, the province where Wuhan lies, according to officials.But cases have also been confirmed around the country, including Beijing and Shanghai.The first case on the self-ruled island of Taiwan was also confirmed Tuesday, with a woman taken to hospital on arrival at the airport from Wuhan.Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV Tuesday that the death toll had risen from four to six.The coronavirus has caused alarm because of its genetic similarities to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. At four airports in Thailand, authorities introduced mandatory thermal scans of passengers arriving from high-risk areas of China.In Hong Kong, authorities said they were on “extreme high alert,” with passengers from Wuhan required to fill out health declarations and face possible jail time if they do not declare symptoms.Enhanced screening measures have also been set up at airports in Australia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Singapore and Russia, Malaysia and Vietnam.A man showing symptoms of the disease who had traveled to Wuhan has been put in isolation in Australia as health officials await test results, authorities said Tuesday.In China, the government announced it was classifying the outbreak in the same category as SARS, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the disease and the potential to implement quarantine measures on travel.In Wuhan, authorities banned tour groups and police were conducting spot checks for animals in vehicles leaving and entering the city, state media said.Passengers were being screened for fever at the airport, railway stations and bus terminals.Doctors at the University of Hong Kong released a study on Tuesday estimating that there have been 1,343 cases of the new virus in Wuhan.The WHO has only called a global public health emergency a handful of times, including during the H1N1 — or swine flu — pandemic of 2009 and the Ebola epidemic that devastated parts of West Africa from 2014 to 2016."

It has also been detected in Japan.“People don’t have to panic as there is no spread of the virus in Thailand,” the ministry said in its statement.The woman, whose condition is improving, arrived from the central Chinese city of Wuhan — believed to be at the epicenter of the outbreak.It came after Thai doctors diagnosed another Chinese traveler with mild pneumonia on January 8, later confirmed to have been caused by the new virus.The World Health Organisation has said “much remains to be understood” about the coronavirus from the same family as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which claimed hundreds of lives more than a decade ago.During the upcoming holiday period, more than 1,300 passengers are expected to arrive in Thailand daily from Wuhan alone."

He reported having a persistent fever.Tests on the patient, who was released from the hospital on Wednesday, confirmed he was suffering from the new virus.“This is the first domestic discovery of a pneumonia case related to the new coronavirus,” the ministry said in a statement.“We will continue active epidemiological research while also coordinating efforts with the World Health Organization and related agencies to conduct a risk assessment,” it added.The outbreak has caused alarm because the new virus is from the same family as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed 349 people in mainland China and 299 in Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003.Authorities in Wuhan said a seafood market was the center of the outbreak. It was closed on January 1.The man hospitalized in Japan said he had not visited the market however, leaving it unclear how he contracted the virus.The health ministry urged people who develop a cough or fever after visiting Wuhan to wear a surgical mask and “swiftly visit a medical institution”.On Wednesday Chinese authorities said the virus may have been spread between family members, opening the possibility of human-to-human transmission.The woman diagnosed in Thailand, who is in a stable condition, also said she had not visited the Wuhan seafood market.WHO doctor Maria Van Kerkhove on Tuesday said she “wouldn’t be surprised if there was some limited human-to-human transmission, especially among families who have close contact with one another”.The outbreak has killed one person so far, with 41 patients reported in Wuhan.Hong Kong authorities on Tuesday said several dozen people had been hospitalized with fever or respiratory symptoms after traveling to Wuhan, but no cases of the new virus have so far been confirmed.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/makeshift-koala-hospital-scrambles-to-save-dozens-injured-in-bushfires/,Makeshift koala hospital scrambles to save dozens injured in bushfires,1,"KANGAROO ISLAND, Australia (AFP) – Dozens of injured koalas arrive at the Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park’s makeshift animal hospital each day in cat carriers, washing baskets or clinging to wildlife carers.Injured in bushfires that have ravaged the wildlife haven off the coast of South Australia state, there are so many marsupials currently requiring urgent treatment that carers don’t have time to give them names — they are simply referred to by a number.Among them is Koala Number 64, who was brought in with burns to all four of his paws.Stretched out on a surgical table in a bustling tent, he has been sedated so the wounds can be examined and treated.“It’s healing nicely,” says veterinarian Peter Hutchison, explaining the koala had already benefitted from a few days’ of treatment.Not all rescued koalas have been so lucky. Many are found so badly injured that they need to be euthanised.Steven Selwood, South Australia Veterinary Emergency Management team leader at the hospital, says around 46,000 koalas were thought to be on the island before this year’s bushfires.It is estimated as few as 9,000 remain, Selwood says, describing the figure as “pretty devastating”.“The fires here were particularly ferocious and fast-moving so we’re seeing a lot less injured wildlife than in other fires,” he tells AFP.“A lot of the wildlife was incinerated.”Australian Environment Minister Sussan Ley said the country’s koala population had taken an “extraordinary hit” as a result of bushfires that have raged for months, suggesting they could be listed as “endangered” for the first time.Kangaroo Island is the only place in Australia where the population is entirely free of chlamydia — a sexually transmitted infection also found in humans that is fatal to koalas.That has made them a key “insurance population” for the future of the species — and even more crucial now that large numbers have died in bushfires on the Australian mainland.Almost half of Kangaroo Island has been razed by fire and an estimated 80 percent of koala habitat wiped out.This widespread destruction has left rescuers with a tricky proposition — what to do with the animals once they have recovered.For now, that issue is on the back burner as teams of vets work overtime to save as many as possible.“He’s going to need another week (to recover) and will need to be kept caged after that,” Hutchinson tells AFP as he wraps a pink bandage around Number 64’s paw.“Because there’s no habitat for him to go back to at this time.”© Agence France-Presse"

It was closed on January 1.There is so far no indication of human-to-human transmission of the virus.Scientists in Hong Kong’s Department of Health said on Saturday that genetic sequencing of the virus from a Wuhan patient, published online by a Chinese expert, indicated it was 80 percent similar to SARS found in bats.WHO said on Monday it was not surprising that the virus had spread beyond China.“The possibility of cases being identified in other countries was not unexpected and reinforces why WHO calls for ongoing active monitoring and preparedness in other countries,” it said in a statement.Thai authorities have been on high alert, with airport officials checking all passengers coming from Wuhan to the kingdom’s major airports.An official from the Public Health Emergency Operation Center told AFP the infected woman traveling from Wuhan had been intercepted on arrival in Thailand after airport officials determined she had a fever.WHO said it had issued guidance on how to detect and treat people with the new virus and stressed that China’s decision to rapidly share the genetic sequencing of the virus made it possible to quickly diagnose patients.WHO has not recommended any specific measures for travelers or restrictions on trade with China, but stressed on Monday it was taking the situation seriously.“Given developments, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will consult with Emergency Committee members and could call for a meeting of the committee on short notice,” it said in a statement.During such meetings, experts determine whether the UN health agency should declare an international health emergency — a designation used only for the gravest epidemics.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/atrocious-child-cancer-ward-reveals-ills-of-russian-healthcare/,‘Atrocious’ child cancer ward reveals ills of Russian healthcare,1,"Moscow, Russia (AFP) — Under-funding, corruption allegations, internal feuding, facilities in disrepair — flaws revealed at a Moscow pediatric cancer ward have shone a harsh spotlight on the afflictions plaguing Russia’s public healthcare system.The Blokhin cancer center, housed in a brutalist 1970s-era compound in the south of the capital, is so notorious that some have taken to calling it “Blokhinwald” after the Nazi-era Buchenwald concentration camp.“Children with cancer are being treated in atrocious conditions, with a lack of ventilation, mold on the walls and overcrowded rooms,” the hospital’s former deputy director of pediatrics, Maxim Rykov, told AFP.Along with 20 of his colleagues, Rykov quit the hospital, which describes itself as Russia’s biggest oncological clinic, in September, accusing its new chief of mismanagement.A health ministry investigation cleared the hospital, but the accusations were hardly a surprise to the parents of children treated there.“The air vents had to be blocked up because the ventilation ducts hadn’t been cleaned for years,” said Tamara Tsvetkova, whose five-year-old daughter Veronika spent a year at the center for leukemia treatment and is now in remission.“In the rooms there were no lockers to put things, we had to buy them ourselves, as well as camp beds so that we could sleep next to our children,” Tsvetkova said.An AFP request to visit the Blokhin clinic was refused.The oncologists who resigned accused the new management, which took over in June, of cutting their salaries by 35 percent, as well as changing treatment regimes to save money.Following media reports, the health ministry opened an investigation that instead accused doctors of enriching themselves through opaque schemes to fund bone marrow transplants.Contacted by AFP, hospital management refused to comment, saying the conflict was “closed”.The medics denied any corruption, saying they arranged for private foundations to pay for transplants because of a lack of public financing.“We do 50 or 60 transplants per year and the state pays for around 30. For the rest, either we abandon the patients or we look for a funding source,” said surgeon Igor Dolgopolov, who resigned in November after a 20-year career.Parents of child patients say they see the doctors who quit as victims of the system.“They’ve saved so many children. I can’t condemn them,” said Nailiya Tugusheva, whose five-year-old daughter Amira also has leukemia.What causes the greatest alarm among parents of young Blokhin patients are changes in some treatment protocols.Foreign-made medicines are being replaced with Russian equivalents, partly because they are cheaper but also due to a government requirement in place since 2015 to support the national pharmaceuticals industry.About 30 parents have written to President Vladimir Putin asking him to reconsider the policy but “nothing came of our message,” Tsvetkova said.The deaths in early December of two girls, aged 14 and 17, at the cancer center after bone marrow transplants have only increased concerns, though no link has been established with the new drugs regime.Russian doctors have generally avoided public disputes, despite very low pay by Western standards, but those at the Blokhin clinic are not the only ones speaking out and posting videos online.In October, neonatologists — treating newborns — threatened to resign from a hospital in the city of Perm in the Urals mountains over low pay and long hours.In the Kurgan region of Siberia, the closure of a tuberculosis center led to protests.And in Moscow in November, two renowned specialists in children’s kidney transplants condemned the veto on foreign medicines, saying no Russian equivalents existed.The government stresses the need to overhaul an inefficient health system, inherited from the Soviet era and hit hard by the economic turmoil of the 1990s.Its so-called optimization drive over the last two decades to better allocate resources has led to the closure of smaller rural hospitals and a concentration of doctors in large multi-functional hospitals in major cities.But in some areas “people have to travel 200 kilometers” (125 miles) for medical help, said Ivan Konovalov, of the Alliance of Doctors trade union.And parts of the countryside often have no more than just first-aid drop-in centers.From 2000 to 2018, the number of hospitals fell from 10,700 to 4,390, according to official figures, while the number of beds per 10,000 Russians dropped from 115 to 71.“Hospitals are short of medicines and patients have to buy them themselves,” Konovalov said.“In our country, a lot of money gets spent on the security forces, army and police and very little on health,” he added.Russia’s health expenditure was 3.7 percent of GDP last year. That’s much less than the 9.5 percent in France or Germany, according to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development data.Putin has acknowledged certain problems, notably a lack of facilities, equipment and staff, and announced an extra 150 billion rubles ($2.3 billion/2.1 billion euros) funding in total for a three-year period beginning this year.Yet, medical student Darya Sosedova, who recently protested outside the health ministry, says she is not convinced by Putin’s promises.“People being fired, the low pay — when you see all that, you wonder if it’s worth continuing your studies and staying in Russia,” she said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/ai-beats-human-breast-cancer-diagnosis/,AI beats human breast cancer diagnosis,1,", (Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women, with more than two million new diagnoses last year alone.Regular screening is vital in detecting the earliest signs of the disease in patients who show no obvious symptoms.In Britain, women over 50 are advised to get a mammogram every three years, the results of which are analysed by two independent experts.But interpreting the scans leaves room for error, and a small percentage of all mammograms either return a false positive — misdiagnosing a healthy patient as having cancer — or false negative — missing the disease as it spreads.Now researchers at Google Health have trained an artificial intelligence model to detect cancer in breast scans from thousands of women in Britain and the United States.The images had already been reviewed by doctors in real life but unlike in a clinical setting, the machine had no patient history to inform its diagnoses.The team found that their AI model could predict breast cancer from the scans with a similar accuracy level to expert radiographers.Further, the AI showed a reduction in the proportion of cases where cancer was incorrectly identified — 5.7 percent in the US and 1.2 percent in Britain, respectively.It also reduced the percentage of missed diagnoses by 9.4 percent among US patients and by 2.7 percent in Britain.“The earlier you identify a breast cancer the better it is for the patient,” Dominic King, UK lead at Google Health, told AFP.“We think about this technology in a way that supports and enables an expert, or a patient ultimately, to get the best outcome from whatever diagnostics they’ve had.”In Britain all mammograms are reviewed by two radiologists, a necessary but labour-intensive process.The team at Google Health also conducted experiments comparing the computer’s decision with that of the first human scan reader.If the two diagnoses agreed, the case was marked as resolved. Only with discordant outcomes was the machine then asked to compare with the second reader’s decision.The study by King and his team, published in Nature, showed that using AI to verify the first human expert reviewer’s diagnosis could save up to 88 percent of the workload for the second clinician.“Find me a country where you can find a nurse or doctor that isn’t busy,” said King.“There’s the opportunity for this technology to support the existing excellent service of the (human) reviewers.”Ken Young, a doctor who manages mammogram collection for Cancer Research UK, contributed to the study.He said it was unique for its use of real-life diagnosis scenarios from nearly 30,000 scans.“We have a sample that is representative of all the women that might come through breast screening,” he said.“It includes easy cases, difficult cases and everything in between.”The team said further research was needed but they hoped that the technology could one day act as a “second opinion” for cancer diagnoses. © Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-unveils-partial-ban-on-flavored-e-cigarettes/,US unveils partial ban on flavored e-cigarettes,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The US government announced Thursday it was banning most flavored e-cigarettes in a bid to curb the rising tide of youth vaping, but under industry pressure, it stopped short of the full ban promised in September by the White House.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said cartridge-based e-cigarettes in flavors other than tobacco or menthol would be illegal unless specifically authorized by the government.The change will take effect in early February, outlawing cartridges with fruit, mint and candy flavors, which are particularly popular with young people.Juul, the e-cigarette industry leader, had anticipated the decision and withdrew those flavors from sale in the US, leaving only tobacco and menthol.The ban will exempt large, tank-based rechargeable vaping devices, however, which are primarily sold in vape shops that cater to adults.“It was the pod cartridge-based systems that got us into this problem that are most attractive to kids,” Health Secretary Alex Azar said in a conference call with reporters.“The kids simply are not using in any material level the open tank vaping systems,” he added.Companies that do not cease making and selling such cartridges will face punishment, the FDA said, without specifying the potential sanctions.“The United States has never seen an epidemic of substance use arise as quickly as our current epidemic of youth use of e-cigarettes,” Azar said in a separate statement.“We aim to see whether e-cigarettes could serve as an effective off-ramp for adult smokers addicted to combustible cigarettes. We believe that remains a possibility,” he added.In late summer, a health crisis marked by severe and sometimes deadly lung ailments added to overall concerns over the success of Juul products among American youths.Some 28 percent of high school seniors said they had vaped in the previous 30 days, according to a government survey in 2019, compared with around 11 percent in 2016.Azar had said in September after a meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office that all flavors would be banned in an effort to curb youth vaping.His announcement triggered a pressure campaign from the tobacco and vaping industries for the administration to reverse the decision. On Thursday, demonstrators chanted “We vape! We vote!” as Trump’s limo drove by in Florida.Speaking for a group of anti-tobacco advocates and public health officials who met with Trump in November, Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, expressed dismay at the new rule, which he said: “creates a giant loophole that will benefit the current existing tobacco companies.”Nancy Brown, CEO and president of the American Heart Association, called it “a huge victory for Juul, vape shops and the rest of the cigarette industry over the interest of this nation.”The industry push highlighted the risk that Trump could lose votes in the 2020 election because of the proposed ban.Trump said he would ultimately settle for raising from 18 to 21 the minimum age for buying vaping products, and the US Congress obliged late December with a vote banning both e-cigarette and tobacco sales to under-21s.The change is due to take effect nationwide by September.Since 2016 the FDA has had authority over vaping products and technically a specific pre-market authorization was needed to sell any of them.But the agency chose not to enforce the rule. It preferred to watch how the market evolved in the hope that vaping could become a public health solution for tobacco smokers who want to quit.Flavors other than menthol and tobacco will be banned starting in February for cartridge-based e-cigarettes. For other types of e-cigarettes, all flavors will remain authorized.But all vaping products will need to request a pre-market authorization by May. They will be able to remain on the market for up to 12 months afterward.Azar said prioritizing flavors most widely used by children would ensure e-cigarettes were not an “on-ramp” to nicotine addiction for youngsters.“We will not stand idly by as this crisis among America’s youth grows and evolves, and we will continue monitoring the situation and take further actions as necessary,” he added.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-raises-tobacco-and-e-cigarette-purchase-age-from-18-to-21/,US raises tobacco and e-cigarette purchase age from 18 to 21,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — The US Congress voted Thursday to raise the minimum age to buy tobacco and e-cigarettes from 18 to 21 across the country, a move intended to stem the rising tide of youth vaping.Passed by the Senate as part of a wider budgetary bill, it will take effect next year and will mean that tobacco and e-cigarettes will join alcohol as substances that are prohibited to purchase for those under the age of 21.Nineteen of the country’s 50 states and the capital Washington, DC had already set 21 as the minimum age.“I’m proud the Senate approved legislation today including our Tobacco-Free Youth Act to help address this urgent crisis and keep these dangerous products away from our children,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, who co-sponsored the bill along with Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.The bill is aimed at combating the skyrocketing popularity of vaping among young people, who have turned away from traditional cigarettes and even alcohol in favor of e-cigarettes.About 28 percent of high school seniors reported vaping in the last 30 days according to a government survey for the year 2019, compared to just 11 percent in 2016.Another benchmark survey published on Wednesday, called Monitoring the Future, showed that 52 percent of high school students said they had consumed alcohol over the last year, against 73 percent in 2000.For cigarettes, the proportion of high school students who smoked in the last month fell to under six percent, almost half the figure in 2016. This summer also saw a major health crisis tied to vaping: an acute lung illness epidemic that has killed more than 50 mostly young people and sickened more than 2,500.The illness was later tied a substance called vitamin E acetate, which is used as a thickening agent for vaping products containing the main psychoactive substance of cannabis — called THC — that is often sold on the black market.But the measure stopped far short of a move announced by President Donald Trump earlier this year, only to be quietly shelved: a ban on flavored vapor such as fruit and menthol, news of which was met with a fierce backlash by industry groups.Market leader Juul has since withdrawn non-tobacco flavors from the US market.But some anti-vaping groups said the new law did not go far enough to address the issue.“Simply raising the age is insufficient to stem the ongoing epidemic of adolescent nicotine addiction wrought by the deliberate abuses of the vaping industry,” said Rob Crane of Preventing Tobacco Addiction Foundation.The federal government as already supposed to be enforcing the current minimum age of 18, but “their negligence in requiring retailer compliance is one of the reasons that 5.2 million American middle school and high school students are inhaling high-potency nicotine regularly,” he added."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/vaping-linked-to-rare-lung-disease-study/,Vaping linked to rare lung disease: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Doctors treating a patient with a rare lung disease usually caused by exposure to industrial metals say it may instead be the first case linked to vaping.Electronic cigarettes are sold as safer alternatives to traditional tobacco products and as aids to stop smoking. But they have been implicated in a growing number of recent deaths and health alerts, especially in the United States.Researchers at the University of California San Francisco said the patient had hard-metal pneumoconiosis, typically found in people exposed to metals such as cobalt or tungsten used in tool sharpening or diamond polishing.It causes a persistent cough and breathing difficulties, and leaves tell-tale scarring on lung tissue.Kirk Jones, Clinical Professor of Pathology at UCSF, said “this patient did not have any known exposure to hard metal, so we identified the use of an e-cigarette as a possible cause.”The case study, published in the European Respiratory Journal, said that when researchers tested the patient’s e-cigarette, which was used with cannabis, they found cobalt in the vapour it released, as well as other toxic metals — nickel, aluminium, manganese, lead and chromium.This was similar to other studies, suggesting that the metals were coming from the heating coils found in vaping devices, rather than from any particular type of re-fill — as has been previously thought.“Exposure to cobalt dust is extremely rare outside of a few specific industries,” Rupal Shah, assistant professor of medicine at UCSF, was quoted as saying.“This is the first known case of a metal-induced toxicity in the lung that has followed from vaping and it has resulted in long-term, probably permanent, scarring of the patient’s lungs,” he said.– E-cigarettes ‘harmful’ – An accompanying European Respiratory Society editorial on stopping smoking rejected the use of e-cigarettes as an aid, saying it was “based on well-meaning but incorrect or undocumented claims or assumptions.”Editorial co-author Jorgen Vestbo, Professor of Respiratory Medicine at the University of Manchester, said “E-cigarettes are harmful, they cause nicotine addiction and can never substitute for evidence-based smoking cessation tools.”Commentators on the findings voiced reservations about making the link based on just one case.Professor John Britton, head of the UK Centre for Tobacco & Alcohol Studies and a consultant in respiratory medicine at the University of Nottingham, said that while cobalt could cause the disease “it is hard to see how they reached this conclusion given that no cobalt particles were detected in the lung samples from the patient.”“This case is thus yet another example of serious lung disease in someone using an electronic cigarette to vape cannabis,” he said, adding that the risk in cases of people vaping nicotine “as an alternative to smoking tobacco is very low.”Earlier this year, the World Health Organization warned that electronic smoking devices were “undoubtedly harmful and should therefore be subject to regulation.”In June, San Francisco became the first major US city to effectively ban their sale and manufacture."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/japan-launches-human-trial-of-new-ebola-vaccine/,Japan launches human trial of new Ebola vaccine,1,"TOKYO, Japan (AFP) — Japanese scientists will begin the country’s first human trial for a new vaccine against the deadly Ebola virus this month, they said Friday.The vaccine, which has previously been tested in monkeys, uses an inactivated form of the virus that can only effectively replicate in artificial cells.Scientists hope that will make it safer than other treatments, the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo said in a press release.“We think there’s high hope for a new, safe vaccine which can be produced effectively,” Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a professor of infectious diseases at the university who helped developed the vaccine, said in the release.The university will begin the clinical study later in December, injecting 30 healthy adult men with two doses of the vaccine, four weeks apart.They will be monitored for side effects and whether they have developed immunity to Ebola.The Ebola virus is passed on by contact with the blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected or recently deceased person.The death rate is typically high, ranging up to 90 percent in some outbreaks, according to the WHO.Several Ebola vaccines exist, including rVSV-ZEBOV and a new formula produced by a Belgian subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson that went into use last month in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The country is in the grip of an Ebola epidemic that has killed more than 2,000 people in 15 months.It is the second most deadly to date after a 2014-2016 outbreak which left some 11,000 people dead and underscored the urgency to bring a vaccine to market.The current outbreak is the tenth in the country since its first in 1976."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/measles-killed-more-than-140000-amid-stagnating-vaccine-rates/,Measles killed more than 140,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — More than 140,000 people died from measles worldwide in 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) and US authorities said Thursday, the result of global vaccination rates that have stagnated for almost a decade.Poorer countries were hardest hit, with the vast majority of measles cases and deaths in sub-Saharan Africa.Wealthier countries, however, have also been battling their own outbreaks, with four European nations losing their “eliminated” status in 2018.The announcement came as the Pacific island nation of Samoa was locked down in order to carry out a mass vaccination drive to cope with an epidemic that has killed 62 and, according to UN officials, was fuelled by anti-vaxxer conspiracy theories on the internet.“The fact that any child dies from a vaccine-preventable disease like measles is frankly an outrage and a collective failure to protect the world’s most vulnerable children,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus, director-general of the World Health Organization.“To save lives, we must ensure everyone can benefit from vaccines – which means investing in immunization and quality health care as a right for all.”Most of the deaths occurred among children under the age of five. Babies and infants are at greatest risk of infection and of developing complications, including pneumonia and brain swelling that can lead to permanent damage, blindness or hearing loss.About 142,300 people lost their lives to the disease in 2018 — a quarter of the number of deaths in 2000, but up 15 percent compared to 2017. There were 9.7 million total cases.The WHO and UNICEF estimated that 86 percent of children globally received the first dose of measles vaccine in 2018, but fewer than 70 percent received the second recommended dose.That is far short of the recommended 95 percent vaccination coverage, with two doses of measles vaccine deemed necessary to protect populations from the disease.The five worst-affected countries, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Liberia, Madagascar, Somalia, and Ukraine, accounted for half of all cases worldwide.But the United States also saw its highest number of cases in 25 years, narrowly avoiding losing its status of having eliminated the disease. The status is lost if an outbreak is sustained continuously for more than a year.Albania, the Czech Republic, Greece, and the United Kingdom meanwhile all lost their eliminated status.The rise comes as a growing anti-vaccine movement gains steam around the world, driven by fraudulent claims linking the MMR vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella to a risk of autism in children.A recent study meanwhile showed that contracting the measles virus decimated the protective antibodies responsible for remembering previous encounters with disease: effectively wiping the host’s immunity memory.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/canadian-vaping-study-details-danger-from-popcorn-lung-chemical/,Samoa’s measles death toll rises to 20,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — A 17-year-old Canadian nearly lost his lungs after five months of intensive vaping, but the ingredient suspected of doing the damage, diacetyl, is different from the substance US authorities blame for dozens of deaths.The case, described Thursday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ), deepens the mysteries surrounding e-cigarettes, which have grown so popular US President Donald Trump earlier this week backed away from a proposed ban on certain vaping flavors, fearing such a move could cost him votes.Vaping has been blamed for 42 deaths in the United States since the past summer. Canada has been relatively spared, with only eight identified patients, and no deaths.The CMAJ study centers around a 17-year-old male vaper who was in good health and vaping daily, particularly green apple and cotton candy flavored refills as well as those containing THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana which Canada legalized in October of last year.The lesions that appeared in his lungs differed from those seen in the US, where more than 2,000 people have fallen ill from what authorities call e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI).In the US, the lungs of patents presented various injuries, but mainly alveolar lesions in the air sacs at the end of the airways. Some had suffered chemical-like burns.US investigators have recently concluded that the culprit is vitamin E oil, which is added to liquid e-cigarette refills, particularly those containing THC.But in Canada, doctors in the CMAJ study determined the lungs of the young vaper suffered from bronchiolitis obliterans, which is inflammation of the small airways of the lungs called bronchioles.The patient had gone to the emergency room after developing a persistent cough and doctors, believing he had pneumonia, first prescribed antibiotics, before hospitalizing him and putting him on life support.The young man’s condition grew so dire a double lung transplant was considered before his condition improved. He stayed 47 days at the hospital, his doctors told AFP.His injuries were similar to those observed in people suffering from “popcorn lung,” a condition found in workers in a microwave popcorn factory who had accidentally inhaled diacetyl, a product used by the food industry which gives popcorn a buttery flavor.Diacetyl is safe if ingested, but dangerous if it enters the lungs.Studies have been warning for years that this product is ubiquitous in electronic cigarette liquids, but no case of injury has previously been reported.The Canadian doctors concluded that the injuries documented in the study show that vitamin E oil isn’t the only dangerous substance e-cigarette users risk coming into contact with.Four months after leaving the hospital, the patient’s lung functions were still down to 45 percent of what would be expected for someone of his age and height, according to the authors of the study from the Lawson Health Research Institute and the University Health Network in Toronto.“This would be classified as severe obstruction,” lead author Karen Bosma, associate scientist at Lawson, said in an interview. “It’s similar to someone who has severe lung disease from smoking their whole life.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/new-york-sues-e-cigarette-firm-juul-for-targeting-youngsters/,Canadian vaping study details danger from ‘popcorn lung’ chemical,1,"NEW YORK, United States (AFP) — New York on Tuesday became the second state this week to sue Juul, the United States’ largest electronic cigarette manufacturer, for illegally targeting minors with its marketing campaigns.The lawsuits come as the vaping industry faces intense scrutiny over an epidemic of lung ailments linked to e-cigarette use that has killed more than 40 people and sickened more than 2,000 in recent months.The New York action, which comes a day after California filed a similar lawsuit, accuses Juul of misleading consumers by misrepresenting its products as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes and of illegally selling to minors.“There can be no doubt that Juul’s aggressive advertising has significantly contributed to the public health crisis that has left youth in New York and across the country addicted to its products,” said state Attorney General Letitia James.The 38-page complaint accuses Juul of glamorizing vaping and appealing to youngsters by deploying colorful ad campaigns that feature young models.E-cigarettes have soared in popularity among young people since they were introduced about a decade ago and Juul sales represent more than 64 percent of all e-cigarettes in the US.The company has denied that its products — including mango, mint and creme brulee-flavored e-cigarettes — were aimed at minors.Ahead of a possible ban by health authorities, the firm this month pulled its mint-flavored products after a study found it was the favorite flavor among high school students.It now sells only three flavors in the US: two tobacco-flavored varieties and menthol.US federal regulators this summer opened an investigation into potentially “deceptive marketing” by Juul amid a surge in deaths related to vaping.President Donald Trump has reportedly backed off from a proposed ban on certain flavors of e-cigarettes, fearing that such a move could cost him votes, US media reported on Monday.The age limit for buying e-cigarettes and related products in New York was recently raised to 21 from 18."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/e-cigarettes-five-things-to-know/,New York sues e-cigarette firm Juul for targeting youngsters,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — E-cigarettes have become hugely popular in the past decade but a rash of vaping-linked deaths and illnesses is feeding caution about a product, already banned in some places.On Thursday an 18-year-old man died in Belgium in a vaping-linked death, the first such case in the country.Here are five things to know about electronic cigarettes. Early designs for an electronic cigarette were drawn up in the United States in the 1960s but Chinese pharmacist Hon Lik is acknowledged as the inventor of a viable commercial version in the early 2000s.Hon, who was trying to quit his own pack-a-day habit, took out patents between 2003 and 2005. But his devices would soon be overtaken as the international market exploded. A battery powers a coil that heats a liquid containing various amounts of nicotine as well as propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin, which mimic tobacco smoke when heated.This “e-juice” can also contain flavourings and other substances, such as THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.E-cigarettes are mostly draw-activated, with the puffing releasing vapour.They do not produce tar or carbon monoxide — two of tobacco’s most noxious elements and associated with cancer and cardiovascular disease. E-cigarettes were initially touted as less damaging than tobacco, which causes around eight million deaths a year.In 2015 public health authorities in England said best estimates showed they were 95 percent less harmful than tobacco.However concern has been growing and in July 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that electronic smoking devices were “undoubtedly harmful and should therefore be subject to regulation”.Another worry is that the vaping flavours are particularly attractive to teenagers and an enticement to pick up the habit.In 2019 the vaping industry is facing major scrutiny amid an epidemic of lung conditions linked to e-cigarette use that has killed 39 and sickened more than 2,000 mostly young people in the US.In November 2019 US health officials said they had identified vitamin E acetate, an oil sometimes used as a thickening agent for vaping products, as the likely culprit behind the epidemic. The number of vapers worldwide has leapt from seven million in 2011 to 41 million in 2018, according to leading market researcher Euromonitor International.By comparison, there were 1.1 billion tobacco smokers on the planet in 2016, according to latest WHO figures on its website.The largest markets for e-cigarettes are the United States followed by Britain, France, Germany and China.The increase in vaping has been particularly dramatic among teenagers. In September 2019 India became the latest country to ban the import, sale, production and advertising of e-cigarettes, citing in particular concerns about its youth.The devices are already banned in several places, such as Brazil, Singapore, Thailand and the US state of Massachusetts, but elsewhere legislation is inconsistent.In June 2019 San Francisco became the first major US city to effectively ban the sale and manufacture of electronic cigarettes.In September New York followed Michigan in banning flavoured e-cigarettes.On November 11, US President Donald Trump said he planned to meet with vaping industry representatives as he considers whether to ban flavoured e-cigarette products.Trump has said he supports raising the minimum age for the purchase of e-cigarettes from 18 to 21, but he has also indicated he is concerned about over-regulation of business."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/two-treated-for-deadly-pneumonic-plague-in-beijing/,E-cigarettes: five things to know,1,"BEIJING, China (AFP) — Two people in Beijing have been diagnosed with the pneumonic plague — a rare instance of the highly-contagious disease that is fatal if left untreated.The two individuals were being treated at a central hospital in China’s capital city — home to over 21 million inhabitants — on Tuesday, local authorities said.Pneumonic plague can prove fatal in 24 to 72 hours and is the “most virulent form of plague,” according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), while the bubonic form is less dangerous.The patients are from the northwestern Inner Mongolia province, district officials said in an online statement, adding that the “relevant prevention and control measures have been implemented.”The Beijing government did not respond to AFP’s calls for comment, but the WHO confirmed that Chinese authorities had notified them about the plague cases.“The (Chinese) National Health Commission are implementing efforts to contain and treat the identified cases, and increasing surveillance,” said Fabio Scano, coordinator at WHO China.Scano told AFP that “the risk of transmission of the pulmonary plague is for close contacts and we understand that these are being screened and managed.”According to the WHO website, the lung-based pneumonic plague is very contagious and “can trigger severe epidemics through person-to-person contact via droplets in the air.”Symptoms include fever, chills, vomiting and nausea.On Weibo, a Twitter-like social media platform, Chinese censors scrubbed the hashtag “Beijing confirms it is treating plague cases” as they tried to control discussions — and panic — around the disease.“I just want to know how these two came to Beijing??” posted one user. “By train, airplane, or did they drive themselves?”“Bird flu in the year of the rooster…swine fever in the year of the pig,” wrote another. “Next year is the year of the rat…the plague is coming.”The plague germ Yersinia pestis can be transmitted to humans from infected rats via fleas.In 2014, a man died of the plague in northwestern Gansu province in China and sparked the quarantine of 151 people.The 30,000 people living in Yumen, the town where the man died, were also prevented from leaving, with police at roadblocks placed on the town perimeter.According to China’s National Health Commission, a total of five people have died from the plague between 2014 and September of this year.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-prequalifies-first-ebola-vaccine/,Two treated for deadly pneumonic plague in Beijing,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday said it had prequalified an Ebola vaccine for the first time, hailing a “critical step” towards its licensing, access and roll-out in countries most at risk of outbreaks.“This is the fastest vaccine prequalification process ever conducted by WHO,” it said in a statement, explaining that “prequalification means that the vaccine meets WHO standards for quality, safety, and efficacy.”The announcement comes hot on the heels of a decision last Monday by the European Commission to allow the release to market of the injectable vaccine, Ervebo, made by US laboratory Merck Sharpe and Dohme (MSD) after the European Medicines Agency gave the product its green light on October 18.“This is a historic step towards ensuring the people who most need it are able to access this life-saving vaccine,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.“Five years ago, we had no vaccine and no therapeutics for Ebola. With a prequalified vaccine and experimental therapeutics, Ebola is now preventable and treatable,” he added.WHO said Ervebo has been shown to be effective in protecting people from the Ebola Zaire virus and added it is recommended by the organization’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) for vaccines as part of a broader set of Ebola response tools.The WHO said licensed doses will only be available from the middle of next year.WHO said it had “accelerated prequalification by reviewing safety and efficacy data as the information became available” and said it was engaged in facilitating licensing for use in countries at risk of Ebola outbreaks.“WHO, with the support of EMA, has worked closely with many African regulators who have indicated they will quickly license the vaccine following the WHO recommendation,” the world body said.Since the current epidemic, which has cost some 2,190 lives out of 3,290 declared cases since it began in DR Congo, more than 236,000 people have been treated, according to the WHO, including 60,000 health professionals, with the vaccine, known in the lab as rVSV-ZEBOV-GP.Merck’s vaccine was administered to them under an exceptional procedure, granting permission to use non-licensed drugs in emergency cases.A second vaccine still at the experimental stage and developed by Johnson & Johnson for administration in two doses at 56-day intervals, is due to be introduced in the coming days in zones where the virus is as yet absent.The current epidemic in DR Congo is the tenth in the country since the first in 1976. It is the second most deadly to date after a 2014-2016 outbreak which cost some 11,000 lives and underscored the urgency to bring a vaccine to market.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/e-cigs-may-damage-the-heart-study-says/,E-cigs may damage the heart,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Vaping devices and the chemicals they deliver — increasingly popular among teens — may damage the cardiovascular system, a study said Thursday, adding to a growing chorus of concern over injury and deaths related to e-cigarettes.The latest findings, published in the journal Cardiovascular Research, come after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month declared an “outbreak of lung injuries” linked to vaping.“E-cigarettes contain nicotine, particulate matter, metal and flavorings, not just harmless water vapor,” senior author Loren Wold of Ohio State University wrote in Thursday’s study.“Air pollution studies show that fine particles enter the circulation and have direct effects on the heart — data for e-cigarettes are pointing in that direction.”Nicotine, also found in tobacco, is known to increase blood pressure and the heart rate.But other ingredients inhaled through the vaping may lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, and unstable blood flow, Wold said.Ultrafine particulate, for example, has been linked to thrombosis, coronary heart disease, and hypertension, among other conditions.E-cigarettes also contain formaldehyde, which has been classified as a cancer-causing agent and associated with heart damage in experiments with rats.Moreover, almost nothing is known about the potential health hazards of flavoring agents that mimic the taste of mint, candy or fruits such as mango or cherry, the study noted.“While most are deemed safe when ingested orally, little is known of their systemic effects following inhalation,” the researchers wrote.To assess possible impacts on the heart and vascular system, Wold and colleagues undertook a systematic review of medical literature, which remains thin due to the newness of e-cigarette use.Wold noted that most studies to date have focused on the acute effects of e-cigarette use rather than the risk of chronic use.Also, little is known about the secondhand effects of vaping, as well as exposure to particles lodged in walls, drapes and clothing.Thirty-seven deaths in 24 states have been linked to e-cigarette and vaping products as of October 29, according to the CDC. There were nearly 1,900 cases of associated lung injury nationwide.In the majority of cases, persons affected also used the devices to consume products containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, raising the possibility that unknown impurities were also present.The CDC discourages non-smokers from starting to use e-cigarettes and suggests individuals trying to kick a tobacco habit use alternatives approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as patches and gums.But the popularity of vaping has skyrocketed since the devices were introduced to the US and European markets just over a decade ago.Vaping users increased from seven million worldwide in 2011 to 41 million in 2018, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).The products are particularly appealing to young users — often by design, according to critics.One in four high school students in the United States uses e-cigarettes, up more than 15 percent from two years ago, according to the 2019 National Youth Tobacco Study.Use by preteens doubled from 2018 to 2019, with 10 percent of middle school students admitted to vaping.“Adults are beginning to get the message that the full health effects of vaping are unknown, and the risk is potentially very high,” said Wold.“My fear is that has not been crystallised in adolescents.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/garbage-crisis-brings-cholera-to-yemens-historic-taez/,study says,1,"TAEZ, Yemen (AFP) — Mounds of stinking garbage line the streets of Yemen’s historic city of Taez, once renowned as one of the most beautiful places in the country, but now torn apart by war.The city in the highlands of southwestern Yemen has become a breeding ground for mosquitos as well as deadly outbreaks of diseases like cholera, as decaying refuse leaches into waterways.Yemen, long the poorest country in the Arabian Peninsula, has been mired in conflict since the Iran-aligned Huthi rebels swept into the capital Sanaa in a 2014 offensive, sparking a military intervention by a Saudi-led coalition.While Taez is controlled by pro-government forces, it is under siege from the Huthis who control the mountains that surround the city, from where they have launched repeated bombardments.While all of Yemen has suffered from the war, Taez is particularly hard-hit. Barely any schools are able to function, freshwater is scarce, and it is difficult to bring in supplies including essentials like food.Trapped within the city limits, Taez’s more than 600,000 people are suffering as garbage mounts up, choking roads and canals.Mounds of brightly colored plastic, old tyres, boxes, and shredded plastic lie in smoldering piles or heaped in dumpsters — a far cry from the days as far back as medieval times when Taez was lauded for its beauty and scale.Cholera, which can kill within hours if left untreated, reappeared in Yemen in April after an initial outbreak in October 2016.The World Health Organization said that 304 people died of the disease between April 2017 and August 2019 in Taez, with cases fluctuating from week to week.Staff at the shabby and ill-equipped hospitals that are still functional amid the continued violence are at their wits’ end, unable to cope with the rising number of patients.“I was sleeping when all of a sudden I woke up to severe stomach pain and diarrhea, and my children rushed me here,” said Arwa Hmeid as she lay on a bed at the city’s general hospital.“The hospital is full of cholera patients and three women have already died since I’ve been here,” she said.Cholera, which causes potentially deadly diarrhea, is contracted by ingesting food or water contaminated with a bacterium carried in human feces and spread through poor sanitation and dirty drinking water.Damage to sewage systems, the electricity grid, and piping have left Yemen’s water supplies vulnerable to contamination.Mohammed Mkharesh, deputy director of the general hospital, said the accumulation of garbage on the streets of Taez and other nearby cities has had a direct impact on people’s health.“This is paving the way for cholera, dengue, and malaria,” he told AFP, adding that hospitals are “under pressure with the increase of cases and lack of resources”.The Yemen conflict, which the United Nations has described as the world’s worst humanitarian situation, has displaced millions and left 24.1 million people — more than two-thirds of the population — in need of aid.Mohammed Jassar, the beleaguered head of Taez’s department of sanitation, said civil servants are doing their best to clean the city.“The department is now working two shifts, one in the morning, and one in the evening… but the garbage keeps piling up and the department lack tools and resources,” he said despondently.“You also see people who just throw garbage on the street even if it is right in front of their home, and then they complain about the mounds of garbage accumulating?”He urged the international community to come to the aid of the Yemeni people, saying that only “if the city is cleaned will the spread of illnesses decrease”.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/researchers-move-closer-to-new-vaccine-for-killer-tb/,Garbage crisis brings cholera to Yemen’s historic Taez,1,"HYDERABAD, India (AFP) — Scientists said Tuesday they are closing in on a new game-changing vaccine for tuberculosis, the world’s deadliest infectious disease that claimed some 1.5 million lives last year.A chronic lung disease that is curable, TB was one of the top 10 killers worldwide last year, particularly in developing countries.The existing Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine — licensed for humans in 1921 — is only proven to be effective for children under five for limited forms of tuberculosis.It does not protect against pulmonary TB, the most common form of the disease amongst adults and teens.In a trial in three African nations, GlaxoSmithKline said its vaccine had 50 percent effectiveness three years after it was given to participants who already have TB bacteria but have not fallen ill from the disease.“These results demonstrate that for the first time in almost a century, the global community potentially has a new tool to help provide protection against TB,” GSK Vaccines’ chief medical officer Thomas Breuer said in a statement released at a conference on lung health in Hyderabad, India.Campaigners said the trial in Kenya, South Africa and Zambia, involving more than 3,000 adults, was a crucial step amid a push for more funding for TB research.South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative director Mark Hatherill said a vaccine would be “the only way in the short-term to interrupt TB transmission and get control of the epidemic.”Ann Ginsberg, of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative which has been taking part in the research, said 15 possible vaccines are at various stages of development around the world but this was the most “exciting”.If successful, the vaccine could “avert tens of millions of new cases of TB and save millions of lives globally.”“We are one more cautious, but exciting, step closer to a vaccine for tuberculosis,” said Paula Fujiwara, scientific director of the Paris-based International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease.The results have to be further tested in longer and larger trials across broader ranges of populations and countries, the scientists said in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the report was published.Breuer said it would take several years to complete the trials and get a licence for a vaccine.About one in four people worldwide carry latent TB, meaning they are infected with the bacteria but are not sick and cannot transmit the disease.Between five to 15 percent develop active TB. Those with compromised immune systems such as people with HIV are more vulnerable to falling sick.The announcement came as thousands of researchers, TB survivors and activists gathered in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad for a global conference on lung health.India accounts for a quarter of the world’s TB cases and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set an ambitious target of ending the epidemic by 2025.©"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/1-in-3-young-children-undernourished-or-overweight-unicef/,Researchers move closer to new vaccine for killer TB,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — A third of the world’s nearly 700 million children under five years old are undernourished or overweight and face lifelong health problems as a consequence, according to a grim UN assessment of childhood nutrition released Tuesday.“If children eat poorly, they live poorly,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore, unveiling the Fund’s first State of the World’s Children report since 1999.“We are losing ground in the fight for healthy diets.”Problems that once existed at opposite ends of the wealth spectrum have today converged in poor and middle-income countries, the report showed.Despite a nearly 40 percent drop from 1990 to 2015 of stunting in poor countries, 149 million children four or younger are today still too short for their age, a clinical condition that impairs both brain and body development.Another 50 million are afflicted by wasting, chronic and debilitating thinness also born of poverty.At the same time, half of the youngsters across the globe under five are not getting essential vitamins and minerals, a long-standing problem UNICEF has dubbed “hidden hunger.”Over the last three decades, however, another form of child malnutrition has surged across the developing world: excess weight.“This triple burden — undernutrition, a lack of crucial micronutrients, obesity — is increasingly found in the same country, sometimes in the same neighborhood, and often in the same household,” Victor Aguayo, head of UNICEF’s nutrition program, told AFP.“A mother who is overweight or obese can have children who are stunted or wasted.”Across all age groups, more than 800 million people in the world are constantly hungry and another two billion are eating too much of the wrong foods, driving epidemics of obesity, heart disease and diabetes.Among children under five, diet during first 1,000 days after conception is the foundation for physical health and mental development.And yet, only two-in-five infants under six months are exclusively breastfed, as recommended. Sales of milk-based formula have risen worldwide by 40 percent and in upper-middle-income countries such as Brazil, China and Turkey by nearly three-quarters.Missing vitamins and minerals, meanwhile, can lead to compromised immune systems, poor sight and hearing defects. A lack of iron can cause anemia and reduced IQ.“It’s ‘hidden’ because you don’t notice the impact until it is too late,” Brian Keeley, editor-in-chief of report, told AFP.“You don’t notice that the child is running a little slower than everyone else, struggling a bit in school.”The rise of obesity, however, is plain to see.The problem was virtually non-existent in poor countries 30 years ago, but today at least 10 percent of under five-year-olds are overweight or obese in three-quarters of low-income nations.“There needs to be a focus on obesity before it is too late,” said Keeley. “Unless you deal with it in a preventative way, you’re going to struggle to fix it later on.”Cheap, readily available junk food, often marketed directly to kids, has made the problem much worse.“Children are eating too much of what they don’t need — salt, sugar and fat,” Keeley added.Progress in fighting undernourishment will also be hampered by climate change, the report warned.A single degree Celsius of warming since the late-19th century has amplified droughts responsible for more than 80 percent of damage and losses in agriculture.Earth’s average surface temperature is set to rise another two or three degrees by 2100.Research by scientists at Harvard University, meanwhile, have shown that the increased concentration of CO2 in the air is sapping staple food crops of those essential nutrients and vitamins, including zinc, iron and vitamin B.“The impacts of climate change are completely transforming the food that is available and that can be consumed,” Aguayo said.Making sure every child has access to a healthy diet must become a “political priority” if widespread malnutrition is to be conquered, especially in developing countries, the report said.Taxes on sugary foods and beverages; clear, front-of-package labeling; regulating the sale of breast milk substitutes; limiting the advertising and sale of ‘junk food’ near schools — these and other measures could make a difference, it concluded.“The way we understand and respond to malnutrition needs to change,” said Fore.“It is not just about getting children enough to eat.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/bacteria-infected-brazilian-mosquitoes-pack-a-punch-in-dengue-fight/,US measles cases exceed 1,1,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AFP) — Dengue-resistant mosquitoes breed in a Rio de Janeiro laboratory, producing offspring infected with bacteria packing a punch in the fight against the deadly virus, which is exploding across Brazil this year.Scientists are using Wolbachia, a bacteria common among insects except for the dengue-transmitting Aedes aegypti mosquito, to dent the spread of the debilitating virus and other illnesses including Zika and chikungunya.Since 2015, the Fiocruz institute in Rio has been producing mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia and releasing their dengue-hardened offspring into the densely populated city and neighboring Niteroi.The hope is they will spread the bacteria by reproducing with wild mosquitoes.Wolbachia works in two ways: it boosts a mosquito’s immune system, making it less likely to contract dengue.But if the mosquito does get dengue, Wolbachia makes it harder for the virus to grow inside the insect and be transmitted to humans.So far, results are promising.Scientists involved in the trial report a “significant reduction” in cases of dengue and chikungunya in targeted neighborhoods.Tests show more than 90 percent of mosquitoes in areas where the first infected insects were released more than three years ago have the bacteria.But Wolbachia is not the silver bullet for eliminating dengue, Luciano Moreira, head of the project in Brazil, tells AFP in a lab as workers walk around waving electrified mosquito racquets to zap insects that have escaped from test tubes.“Where there are people, there are mosquitoes,” Moreira explains, surrounded by hundreds of tubes holding thousands of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.“We always say we are not the solution, it has to be an integrated process done together.“People still have to destroy breeding sites at home. You want to have less mosquitos, but mosquitoes with Wolbachia.“If there is a vaccine you can use it in conjunction with that … it has to be a combination.”Brazil is one of several countries holding trials of the so-called Wolbachia method, which began in Australia in 2011, to tackle the virus that infects tens of millions around the world every year.The self-sustaining process does not involve genetic modification (GM), which has been tested in Brazil and elsewhere.In one GM trial, thousands of male mosquitoes carrying a “self-limiting gene” designed by British biotech company Oxitec were released in the eastern Brazilian state of Bahia between 2013 and 2015.The number of viable offspring fell dramatically, suppressing the wild mosquito population by an average of 70 percent compared with before the release, Oxitec found.But mosquito numbers rebounded after the project ended.Moreira says previous attempts to wipe out mosquito populations have failed.“There are too many (mosquitoes),” he says.Thousands of bacteria-carrying mosquitoes at Fiocruz institute are the descendants of insects originally infected with Wolbachia at Australia’s Monash University.Researchers there took the bacteria from fruit flies and injected it into mosquito eggs using a very fine needle.The Brazilian insects are kept in small boxes in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room.During their brief lives, which can be as long as 100 days in the lab, females have sex with their male counterparts multiple times.After mating, the females dine on human blood supplied by a blood bank, and then deposit their eggs on the surface of water held in plastic containers.The eggs, which inherit Wolbachia from the female, are harvested and transferred to large test tubes.Only female mosquitoes consume blood, which they need to produce eggs, Catia Cabral, supervisor of the insectary, tells AFP during a recent visit.Any blood type is ok, but fresh is always best.“She is going to prefer 1,000 times more the blood from my arm, but she can’t choose here so she has to eat this blood,” says Cabral, showing AFP a bag of blood from a bank.Within two weeks, the infected offspring have grown into adults and are ready for release.Brazil’s health ministry plans to expand the program to municipalities in other parts of the country to see if similar results can be produced in different environments.But state and federal government budget cuts mean no more Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes will be released in Rio or Niteroi after December, Moreira says.He is lobbying authorities to keep the program going.“Rio (state) has had quite large financial problems in recent years and for that reason cannot invest in this project,” Moreira explains.The decision comes as Brazil sees a spike in the number of cases of dengue, which causes fever, rash, nausea and — in some cases — death.More than 1.4 million cases were registered in the first eight months of this year, health ministry figures show, up 600 percent on the same period in 2018.Nearly 600 people have died so far.Moreira blames this year’s surge on the return of type two dengue, which has not been seen in Brazil for years, meaning many people have no resistance.Unseasonal rain and high temperatures are also fueling the outbreak, the health ministry says.A vaccination for the four types of dengue was in the “final stage of tests,” Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta announced last month.Mandetta hopes it will be ready next year. In the meantime, he said, Brazilians should brace for a “very tough summer.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/red-meat-unhealthy-maybe-not-after-all/,200 but elimination status maintained,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Cutting back on red meat is standard medical advice to prevent cancer and heart disease — but a review of dozens of studies has concluded that the potential risk is low and evidence uncertain.In new guidelines published on Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, a panel of researchers from seven countries suggested that “adults continue current unprocessed red meat consumption.”The advice — which immediately drew a sharp reaction from other experts — added that adults should also “continue current processed meat consumption.”The research, published in the journal edited by the American College of Physicians, analyzed multiple studies that, taken together, showed reducing red meat consumption by three servings per week could lower cancer mortality by seven deaths per 1,000 people.Researchers said any such decline was modest and that they had found only a “low” degree of certainty about the statistic.They added that the quality of evidence linking processed meat with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes was “very low.”“There are very small risk reductions in cancer, heart disease and diabetes, however the evidence is uncertain,” Bradley Johnston, an epidemiology professor at Canada’s Dalhousie University and director of the NutriRECS group that put together the guidelines, told AFP.“So there may be a reduction — or there may not be.“People need to make their own decisions. We are giving them the best estimate of the truth.” The researchers said they want to change the “old school” approach of giving general nutritional recommendations, and to bring more focus on evidence of individual benefit.“People should look at this and hopefully make more well-informed personal choices, rather than being told what to do by authoritative organizations,” Johnston said.But eating less red meat and processed meat has been a cornerstone of dietary guidance for decades in many countries and from leading health groups.The World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer says that processed meat is carcinogenic, while red meat is “probably carcinogenic.”In response to the latest guidelines, the World Cancer Research Fund said it would not change its advice.“We maintain our confidence in the rigorous research conducted for 30 years,” said its director of research, Giota Mitrou.Marji McCullough, epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society, said the researchers had taken into account people’s personal values and preferences.“It’s kind of like saying: ‘we know helmets can save lives, but some people still prefer the feeling of the wind in their hair when they ride bikes. And let’s face it, most people won’t crash’,” she said.“But everyone agrees you should wear a helmet.”Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at Britain’s Open University, said the lack of hard scientific evidence meant there were few clear answers.“Depressingly, all this tends to indicate that after all these years and all these millions of research participants, we still don’t know much,” he said."

Sixteen percent of those taken ill were under age 18.E-cigarettes have been touted as a safer alternative to smoking. But critics say the risks are insufficiently understood, while flavored vaping liquids appeal particularly to children and risk getting them addicted to nicotine.The US Food and Drug Administration’s laboratories are testing more than 150 samples of suspect product, but have yet to identify the substance responsible for the patients’ severe pulmonary disease, said Mitch Zeller, who directs the agency’s Center for Tobacco Products. “There is no consistent pattern when it comes to … what products plural are being used, how they’re being used, where they might have been purchased, and what might have happened to the products along the way, from the time that they were put into the hands of the end user, to the moment of aerosolization, and, inhalation,” Zeller said.Investigators have so far been careful not to point the finger at any one brand, product or source.In many cases, vaping refills containing THC, the principal psychoactive compound in cannabis, were linked to those taken ill.Refills are often purchased on the street or internet, since cannabis remains illegal in many parts of the United States. Counterfeit refills whose ingredients are unknown could also be at cause.The FDA, whose Office of Criminal Investigations is now involved in the inquiry, is running tests to determine with what substances the nicotine or THC was cut, as well as whether any additional diluents, additives, pesticides, poison or toxins were used.Health authorities first realised in July that vaping was linked to the severe breathing difficulties, coughing, chest pain and even nausea being reported by young people.Most reported that they had vaped cannabis-laced e-liquids, but some said they had used only nicotine products.Reacting swiftly to the health scare, the state of New York banned flavored e-cigarettes Tuesday, effective immediately, following in the footsteps of Michigan which declared a ban earlier this month that has yet to go into effect.On Thursday, the city attorney for Los Angeles, Mike Feuer, likewise recommend a citywide ban on flavored tobacco products.And in India authorities announced on Wednesday a ban on the sale of all electronic cigarettes.Concerns have reached the halls of the US Congress, prompting Democratic and Republican lawmakers to take the rare step Thursday of launching a bipartisan group to reduce youth vaping.“The victims cut across party lines, ethnic lines, socio-economic lines, geography, race and ethnicity,” House Democrat and group co-founder Raja Krishnamoorthi told AFP.“It’s such a big epidemic that everybody’s affected at this point.”Krishnamoorthi welcomed the recent announcement by President Donald Trump’s administration to soon implement a national ban on flavored e-cigarette products.That would be an important first step, provided mint flavors are also banned, the congressman said at a press event.“We have to stop this epidemic of youth vaping,” added Republican congressman Peter King. “This is a serious health epidemic.”"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/mother-or-baby-die-in-child-birth-every-11-seconds-un/,Mother or baby die in child birth every 11 seconds: UN,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — Global child and maternal deaths have fallen sharply in recent decades, but new UN statistics released Thursday show unequal progress, with more than five childbirths a minute ending in tragedy.Two reports by several United Nations’ agencies showed clear global progress in reducing the number of pregnant women or new mothers and young children who die each year, pointing to improved access to affordable, quality health services.“In countries that provide everyone with safe, affordable, high-quality health services, women and babies survive and thrive,” World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.Since the turn of the century, the number of deaths among children under the age of five has been cut almost in half to some 5.3 million worldwide last year.Almost half of those deaths occurred during the first month of life, meaning that around 7,000 newborns still died every single day last year.At the same time, the number of women dying due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth dropped by more than a third to around 295,000 in 2017, compared to 451,000 in 2000.While this marks a huge improvement, some 800 women still died each day from complications in pregnancy and childbirth in 2017, the UN numbers showed.In all, the statistics reveal that an estimated 2.8 million women and newborns die every year, mostly from preventable causes.“Around the world, birth is a joyous occasion. Yet, every 11 seconds, a birth is a family tragedy,” head of the UN children’s agency Henrietta Fore said in the statement.“A skilled pair of hands to help mothers and newborns around the time of birth, along with clean water, adequate nutrition, basic medicines and vaccines, can make the difference between life and death,” she insisted. “We must do all it takes to invest in universal health coverage to save these precious lives.”The reports showed that stark inequalities persist around the world in accessing the services and care needed to ensure safe childbirth.Sub-Saharan Africa has the most dire situation, with levels of maternal deaths nearly 50 times higher than in high-income countries, and with babies there 10 times more likely to die than in wealthier parts of the world.In 2018, one out of every 13 children in the region died before their fifth birthday, compared to one in 196 children in Europe, the UN numbers showed.At the same time, one out of every 37 women in sub-Saharan Africa dies in childbirth. By comparison, only one out every 6,500 women in Europe have a lifetime chance of dying in childbirth.Under the Sustainable Development Goals, the world has committed to trying to bring the global maternal mortality ratio to below 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.But the UN warned that at the current pace, the world will miss that target by more than one million lives.While rates have generally trended downwards, the UN figures showed that the maternal mortality ratios actually increased in 13 countries between 2000 and 2017.A number of those countries were places facing conflict or crisis, such as Syria and Venezuela.But the United States actually showed the greatest increase, with the ratio soaring by 58 percent over the 17-year-period to 19 deaths for every 100,000 live births.The world’s countries have also committed to reducing neonatal mortality to no more than 12 per 1,000 live births and under-five mortality to no more than 25 per 1,000 live births by 2030.Many countries have already reached that target, but more than 50 nations are lagging far behind.“Unless we really accelerate, we are going to lose 50 million kids unnecessarily,” Stefan Peterson, UNICEF’s health chief told reporters in Geneva."

Michigan became the first state to declare a ban earlier this month, but that law has yet to be implemented.“It is undeniable that vaping companies are deliberately using flavors like bubblegum, Captain Crunch and cotton candy to get young people hooked on e-cigarettes — it’s a public health crisis and it ends today,” said Cuomo.President Donald Trump’s administration announced last week that it would soon ban flavored e-cigarette products to stem a rising tide of youth users.The move could later be extended to an outright prohibition of vaping if adolescents migrate to tobacco flavors, seen as more legitimate products that help smokers quit their habit, said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates e-cigarettes.“New York is not waiting for the federal government to act, and by banning flavored e-cigarettes we are safeguarding the public health and helping prevent countless young people from forming costly, unhealthy and potentially deadly life-long habits,” Cuomo added.Shops in New York now have two weeks to remove vaping products from their shelves. The ban does not prohibit menthol or tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes.E-cigarettes have been available in the US since 2006 and are sometimes used as an aid to quit smoking traditional tobacco products like cigarettes.Their use among adolescents has skyrocketed in recent years: some 3.6 million middle and high school students used vaping products in 2018, an increase of 1.5 million on the year before.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently that there were now more than 450 possible cases of pulmonary illness associated with vaping in the US.The CDC has cautioned against vaping as officials investigate the precise cause of the deaths. No single substance has been found to be present in all the laboratory samples being examined.New York’s health department found very high levels of vitamin E oil in cannabis cartridges used by dozens of people in the state who had fallen ill after using e-cigarettes.Vitamin E is a commonly used nutritional supplement but is dangerous when inhaled.San Francisco, the home of market leader Juul Labs, became the first American city to ban e-cigarettes in June last year.The FDA has warned Juul to stop advertising itself as a less harmful alternative to smoking, noting in particular the company’s attempts to attract young people.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/in-ivory-coast-telemedicine-revolution-proves-blessing-for-heart-patients/,10,1,"Bouaké, Ivory Coast (AFP) — Every time Catherine Coulibaly’s 19-year-old son had to make a routine appointment with the cardiologist for his heart condition, she gritted her teeth as she silently counted the financial cost.It wasn’t just the hospital fee — there was the transport, food and accommodation, too, all of it amounting to a hefty burden for an Ivorian family on a modest income.But thanks to telemedicine — consultations that doctors conduct through the internet or by phone — this cost is now a fading memory. Her son can book an appointment at a telemedicine facility in a nearby town in northern Ivory Coast.There, he is attached to monitoring machines which send the data sent to Bouake University Hospital in the centre of the country, where it is scrutinised by a heart doctor.The fledgling technology has long been championed by health advocates for poor rural economies.Ivory Coast has become an African testbed for it, thanks to a project linking the Bouake hospital’s cardiac department with health centres in several northern towns, some of which are a four-hour drive away. Telemedicine “caused a sigh of relief for the population of Bouake, Boundiali, Korhogo, everyone,” says Auguste Dosso, president of the “Little Heart” association, which helps families with cardiac health issues.Some 45 percent of the Ivorian population live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank’s latest estimate in 2017. And the minimum monthly wage — not always respected — is only around $100, or 90 euros. The pioneer behind the scheme is cardiologist Florent Diby, who set up an association called Wake Up Africa.In Ivory Coast, heart disease, diabetes and other “lifestyle” ailments are surging, Diby explained. “Urbanisation is making people more sedentary, and there’s the rise in tobacco consumption, changes in diet, stress,” Diby said.Three decades ago, only around one in eight of the Ivorian population had high blood pressure — now the figure is one in four, on a par with parts of Western Europe.But in Ivory Coast — and across Africa — well-equipped cardiology units are rare.“Ninety percent of heart attacks can be diagnosed by telemedicine, so for us cardiologists it’s a revolutionary technology,” said Diby.The beauty of the telemedicine scheme is that neither the doctor nor the patient has to travel far. The cardiac patient is hooked up to the electrocardiogram (ECG) and other diagnostic machines with the help of a technician in a local health centre, which is connected to a computer in Bouake’s University Hospital. The cardiologist there can then see the results in real time, provide a diagnosis and prescribe treatment. The five-year-old project has already linked 10 health centres to the seven cardiologists at Bouake, enabling 4,800 patients in other towns to receive consultations by telemedicine each year. The goal is to expand this to 20 sites, doubling the intake.Expertise France, the French public agency for international technical assistance, subsidises up to 185,000 euros of the network, which pays for equipment such as computers, artificial intelligence software and internet connections. Diby is now calling for telemedicine to be expanded in other medical fields such as neurology and psychiatry, not just in the Ivory Coast, but across West Africa too.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/vaccines-trends-mistrust-and-consequences/,dies of rare brain-eating amoeba after swimming in river,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Vaccines have saved tens of millions of lives but immunization rates have stagnated in recent years due in part to fake news stories claiming vaccinations can cause measles, autism or sterility.Here are some key facts about vaccinations:Immunization prevents two to three million deaths every year, and could prevent another 1.5 million if vaccination programs were fully implemented.But vaccination rates have “dangerously” stalled, according to a July report from the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF.Lats year, 19.8 million children under the age of one did not receive the basic triple “DPT” vaccine against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough, or were not protected against measles.“That means that more than one in ten are not getting all the vaccinations they need,” said Kate O’Brien, head of WHO’s vaccine department.Two-thirds of these unvaccinated children live in ten countries: Angola, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, The Philippines, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Vietnam.Worldwide, DPT and measles vaccination rates have stalled since 2010 at about 86 percent.For measles, the figure has dropped to 69 percent if one takes into account the booster, which is required for a high level of immunity.While these figures may seem high, they are still “insufficient” and need to climb to 95 percent, the WHO has warned.Measles outbreaks are occurring worldwide, in countries rich and poor. More than 360,000 cases have been reported since January, the highest figures since 2006, said the WHO.There were 90,000 cases reported in Europe during the first six months of 2019, more than double the number from the same period last year.Based on the 2018 data, four European countries recently lost their “measles free” status: Albania, Britain, the Czech Republic and Greece.Measles is more contagious than tuberculosis or Ebola, yet it is eminently preventable with a vaccine that costs pennies.Often benign, is can nonetheless cause severe symptoms — fever, rash, coughing — as well as blindness and, for pregnant women, miscarriages.The disease can also be fatal. In 2000, measles is estimated to have killed more than half-a-million people. In 2016, that figure had dropped to 90,000 but climbed the following year to 110,000.Vaccination rates have stagnated for two distinct reasons.One is growing mistrust — mostly in wealthy nations — fuelled by the fear that they cause disease or conditions such as autism. The second is poor access in countries with weak healthcare systems.Ironically, France — home of Louis Pasteur, the inventor of the vaccine — harbours one of the highest rates of suspicion: one in three people there are not sure vaccines work, according to a survey conducted for the British healthcare foundation Wellcome Trust.Other countries where vaccine doubt runs high include Gabon, Togo, Russia and Switzerland.By contrast, nearly the entire population of Bangladesh and Rwanda say they have confidence in the efficacy and safety of vaccines.“These are areas where you have more infectious disease,” said Imran Khan, Wellcome Trust’s head of public engagement and lead researcher for the survey.“Perhaps what you see is the people in those countries can see what happens if you don’t vaccinate.”A lot of “anti-vaxers” cite a 1998 study published by The Lancet, a respected medical journal, that reported a causal link between vaccines and autism in children.When it was revealed that evidence underlying this claim had been falsified, the study was withdrawn and its author Andrew Wakefield barred from the profession. But the damage was done.Hostility towards immunisation can also have religious roots.New York state, for example, recently revoked a vaccine exemption for school children on the basis of religious belief following measles outbreaks in districts with large orthodox Jewish communities.In Afghanistan and Pakistan, some religious leaders say the polio vaccine is part of a conspiracy to sterilise Muslim children. And in the DRC, an audio recording circulated on social networks earlier this year calling on people to physically attack health workers inoculating against the Ebola virus.Vaccines are also to some extent a victim of their own success.“We no longer see the diseases, just reports about possible side-effects,” said Cornelia Betsch, a researcher at the University of Erfurt in Germany who has written extensively about vaccine policy.“That leads us to over-estimate the risks of vaccination, and under-estimate the risks of the diseases.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-to-ban-flavored-vaping-products-as-lung-disease-cases-surge/,In Ivory Coast,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — US President Donald Trump’s administration announced Wednesday it would soon ban flavored e-cigarette products to stem a rising tide of youth users, following a spike in vaping-linked deaths.The move could later be extended to an outright prohibition of vaping if adolescents migrate to tobacco flavors, seen as more legitimate products that help smokers quit their habit.Addressing reporters at the White House, the president said that both he and First Lady Melania Trump were worried as parents of a teenage son about an outbreak of severe lung disease that has killed six people and sickened hundreds.“We are both reading it,” he said. “A lot of people are reading, people are dying of vaping,” he added, vowing to act.Trump was accompanied by Ned Sharpless, the acting head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that regulates e-cigarettes and by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who responded to a question about the proposed timeline by saying his agency would issue rules in the coming weeks.Following the release of new guidance, “there will likely be about a 30-day delayed effective date,” said Azar.“At that point, all flavored e-cigarettes other than tobacco flavor would have to be removed from the market.”The agency said in a release that non-tobacco flavors were being targeted for their youth appeal, with preliminary data for 2019 showing that more than a quarter of high school students had used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days.The overwhelming majority reported using fruit, menthol or mint flavors.While tobacco flavors will initially be exempt, manufacturers will still need to apply for FDA approval by May 2020 to continue to sell their products.But Azar also tweeted: “If data show kids migrating to tobacco-flavored products, we will do what’s necessary to tackle continued youth use of these products.”The news was a major blow to the burgeoning vaping industry, worth $10.2 billion globally in 2018, according to Grand View Research.It comes amid growing concern over how more than 450 people who reported recent use of e-cigarettes have fallen ill, with initial symptoms including breathing difficulty and chest pain before some were hospitalized and placed on ventilators.Several teens across the country have been placed in medically-induced comas, including one whose doctors said he may require a lung transplant if he recovers.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged people to cease vaping while a nationwide investigation is underway.Federal authorities have yet to identify a single substance common to all cases, but New York’s health department is focusing its probe on counterfeit cannabis cartridges containing vitamin E oil, which is harmful when inhaled.North Carolina medics have reported that patients developed acute lipoid pneumonia, a non-infectious form of the respiratory illness that occurs when oils or fat-containing substances enter the lungs.E-cigarettes have been available in the US since 2006 and were widely considered a safer alternative to traditional smoking, even though experts had warned even before the current wave of illnesses that it may take decades to learn about vaping’s long-term effects.While e-cigarettes do not contain the estimated 7,000 chemical constituents present in traditional cigarettes, a number of substances have been identified as potentially harmful and the vapor could contain traces of metal, according to a 2018 study prepared for Congress.It’s also not clear why the US is so far alone in reporting such cases, and whether they are even new, or only being recognized now by doctors after earlier misdiagnoses.Whatever the case, wider public and political opinion appears to be hardening.Trump’s announcement received bipartisan support, including from his longtime Republican critic and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, and several Democrats including Senate whip Dick Durbin, who commended the FDA for “doing its job.”Billionaire and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who on Tuesday announced a $160 million campaign to ban vaping, said the flavor ban was overdue and should come into effect immediately.The FDA has become increasingly assertive against the sector over misleading advertising and on Monday accused market-leading e-cigarette maker JUUL of breaking the law, warning it to cease presenting itself as less harmful than smoking.But shares in Altria, which holds a one-third stake in JUUL, were stable by 4:00 pm (2000 GMT), following the announcement.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/what-is-dengue-and-why-is-it-so-widespread-this-year/,telemedicine revolution proves blessing for heart patients,1,"HANOI, Vietnam (AFP) — Dubbed “breakbone fever”, dengue is one of the world’s leading mosquito-borne illnesses and infects tens of millions across the globe annually.Around half of the planet’s population live in at-risk areas, mainly in Latin America, Africa and Asia.Explosive outbreaks have ravaged Southeast Asia this year, infecting hundreds of thousands, killing hundreds, and crippling health care systems as governments struggle to contain the untreatable virus.So what is dengue, how does it spread, and how can it be contained?Dengue is transmitted mainly by the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, which thrives in densely-populated tropical climates and breed in stagnant pools of water.The mosquitoes pick up the virus from infected humans — even asymptomatic ones — and pass it along to other people through bites.Infections have steadily climbed across the globe since the 1970s due to rising temperatures and irregular monsoon rains linked to climate change, which allow for ideal mosquito breeding conditions.Dengue is mostly found in crowded areas, and breakneck urbanisation across the globe has helped the virus thrive, especially in fast-growing mega-cities like Manila, Rio de Janeiro, Ho Chi Minh City and Tegucigalpa.A massive boom in international travel and trade has also expanded dengue’s footprint, allowing the virus to be carried across the globe in a matter of hours and unleashed in new communities.Experts say the widespread adoption of plastic is also to blame — storage containers, discarded takeout boxes, backyard pools, plant pots and cooking urns all collect water — a problem made worse during dry spells.“When you have a drought, people collect water in containers. That is one place the dengue mosquito loves to breed,” said Gawrie Loku Galappaththy, a dengue specialist with the World Health Organization in the Philippines.Its grim nickname comes from the disease’s intense flu-like symptoms: severe headache, pain behind the eyes, full-body aches, high fever, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands or rash.It’s most serious — and deadly — in children, especially young girls though scientists don’t know why.Contracting one of dengue’s four strains gives immunity only to that particular one — which is why adults in endemic areas are often safe because they’ve likely had it before.But later picking up a different strain, called a serotype, usually causes a worse infection than the first time.With no known treatment for dengue, doctors can only help to ease the virus’ brutal symptoms, which can last weeks and often renders patients completely immobile.Once confined mostly to cities in tropical climates, dengue is now found in at least 125 countries across the world, with around 100 million infected every year and some four billion people living in dengue-prone areas, according to the journal Nature Microbiology.The disease is cyclical — dramatic outbreaks occur every few years — but climate change is believed to have contributed to a spike in cases in 2019, with July clocked as the warmest on record.“Extremely warm temperatures we’ve seen this year” likely facilitated its spread, Rachel Lowe, assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, told AFP, since mosquitoes thrive in warm weather climates.Several European countries where dengue was once marginal have seen outbreaks, while Latin American countries including Brazil, Colombia, Honduras and Nicaragua are tackling a surge in cases.In Southeast Asia insecticide fogging is commonly used to kill mosquitoes off, but they usually return after a few days, and insects can quickly become resistant to the chemicals.A controversial vaccine developed by French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi Pasteur has been greenlit for use in 21 countries and the European Union — but it’s far from perfect.The vaccine, called Dengvaxia, requires three doses, and should only be given to people above the age of nine — the maximum age varies by country — who have been previously infected by dengue.In 2016 the Philippines was one of the first countries to use Dengvaxia in a mass immunization program, but its fumbled rollout has been blamed for the deaths of dozens of children and led to its eventual ban.Several countries are also trialling the so-called Wolbachia method, and though it’s too early to say if the approach works on a large scale, early results are promising.Mosquitoes are infected with the naturally-occurring Wolbachia bacteria — which is mostly dengue-resistant — and are released to repopulate wild mosquito colonies to reduce disease transmission.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/shorter-people-run-higher-risk-of-diabetes-study/,Vaccines: Trends,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Shorter people are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, according to a study published Tuesday.Each additional 10 centimeters in height translates into a 41 percent smaller chance of contracting the disease in men and a 33 percent smaller chance in women, according to the research in medical journal Diabetologia.The greater health risk in shorter individuals is likely linked to higher liver fat content, and a larger number of risk factors for heart disease, stroke and diabetes, the authors speculated.It has also been reported that insulin sensitivity and the functioning of special cells in the pancreas that secrete the hormone are better in taller people.The study draws from a detailed medical survey of more than 16,600 women and nearly 11,000 men — aged 40 to 65 — in Potsdam, Germany from 1994 to 1998.“These observations corroborate that height is a useful predictive marker for diabetes risk,” the authors concluded.People with diabetes have excessively high blood glucose, or blood sugar, which comes from food.Some 420 million people around the world today suffer from diabetes, with the number expected to rise to 629 million by 2045, according to the International Diabetes Federation.Currently, the disease is divided into two sub-types.With type-1 — generally diagnosed in childhood and accounting for about 10 percent of cases — the body simply doesn’t make insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels.For type-2, the body makes some insulin but not enough, which means glucose stays in the blood.This form of the disease correlates highly with obesity and can, over time, lead to blindness, kidney damage, heart disease or stroke. Acute cases may also require limb amputations.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/mosquito-trials-raise-hopes-of-defeating-dengue/,mistrust and consequences,1,"NHA TRANG, Vietnam (AFP) — Hundreds dead in the Philippines; a threefold increase of cases in Vietnam; hospitals overrun in Malaysia, Myanmar and Cambodia — dengue is ravaging Southeast Asia this year due in part to rising temperatures and low immunity to new strains.But one group of scientists is rolling out trials to breed dengue-resistant bugs in a bid to tackle one of the world’s leading mosquito-borne illnesses, raising hopes the untreatable disease can finally be beaten.The World Mosquito Program (WMP) has pioneered a method where male and female Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes are infected with the disease-resistant bacteria called Wolbachia before being released into the wild.In a matter of weeks, baby mosquitoes are born carrying Wolbachia, which acts as a disease buffer for the bugs — making it harder for them to pass on not only dengue, but Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever.First trialled in northern Australia, it’s been tested in nine countries around the globe, including in Vietnam where early results are promising.“We have seen a remarkable reduction of dengue cases after the release,” explained Nguyen Binh Nguyen, project coordinator for WMP in Nha Trang.His team set free around half a million Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes last year in Vinh Luong, a crowded dengue-prone district in southern Vietnam.Since the trials, dengue cases are down 86 percent in Vinh Luong compared to nearby resort town Nha Trang.That’s a major relief for Cong Thi Thu, an accountant who along with her two children suffered an intense bout of dengue in 2016, flooring the family for weeks.She worries less after the trials but still makes her kids sleep under nets and no longer leaves stagnant water to collect in the pots around her garden, which offer ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.“I feel at ease now, 70 to 80 percent safe, but I still have to be careful,” Thu said from her leafy compound.Today, mosquitoes still buzz about in the open-air shops, cafes and homes of Vinh Luong, but the majority in the test areas now carry Wolbachia compared to none before the trials, WMP said.Convincing wary residents like Thu, along with health officials and ethics boards, that the mosquitoes won’t make them sick was not an easy task.Residents have long ascribed to the official motto “no mosquitoes, no larvae, no dengue” to avoid the virus, dubbed “breakbone fever” because of its severe flu-like symptoms.Dengue is passed along to humans by infected mosquitoes, which thrive in crowded, hot and humid neighbourhoods like Thu’s.Cases have surged not only in Vietnam this year but across Southeast Asia, with around 670,000 infected and more than 1,800 people dead in the region, according to an AFP tally of national and World Health Organization data.Experts say it’s the worst outbreak in years.Warmer weather is one factor — temperatures in July 2019 were the hottest ever recorded globally, and mosquitoes love hot weather — coupled with the introduction of new dengue strains that have spread among populations with no immunity.Long-term trends are also at play: breakneck urbanization in Asian megacities, a massive increase in international travel and trade and the cyclical nature of outbreaks.“That creates the perfect ingredients for the dengue epidemic to happen,” Rachel Lowe, assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, told AFP.Even the widespread use of plastics has contributed — as things like garden pots and takeout containers collect water they create perfect breeding pools for mosquitoes.Wolbachia was first discovered by scientists in the 1920s in mosquitoes living in the drainage system beneath the Harvard University School of Public Health.Found in 60 percent of all insect species — including dragonflies, fruit flies and moths — the bacteria was mostly ignored until the 1970s when researchers discovered it could be used to prevent the spread of disease by bugs.Over the years scientists have conducted anti-dengue experiments with Wolbachia-laden mosquitoes with varied success, but now WMP hopes it’s approach will stick.It is one of the only organizations in the world seeking to repopulate colonies with Wolbachia-infected mosquitos to fight dengue, estimated to spread to as many as 100 million people globally every year.Other groups, including in Singapore and Malaysia, are using Wolbachia but only in male mosquitoes who render female eggs infertile — a method that aims to suppress the mosquito population, which rarely lasts.Many countries are also fogging neighborhoods with insecticides — effective in the short term, though the mosquitoes often come back in just a few days, or develop resistance to the chemical killers.“No one has been able to get long-lasting suppression because the mosquitoes just keep re-invading,” said WMP director Scott O’Neill.Results from WMP’s Wolbachia trials in northern Australia and on the Vietnamese island Tri Nguyen have been positive — local dengue transmissions are almost non-existent — and outcomes from trials in Indonesia are expected in the next year.But experts say more long-term, and large-scale, studies are needed to see if the approach really works.Dr Raman Velayudhan, coordinator of WHO’s global control programme on dengue, said: “Our bottom line is to make sure that it leads to the reduction of the disease.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/global-measles-cases-triple-year-on-year-who/,US to ban flavored vaping products as lung disease cases surge,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — Measles cases nearly tripled globally during the first seven months of the year compared to the same period in 2018, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, amid growing concern over public resistance to the vaccine.So far this year, 364,808 measles cases were reported around the world, compared to 129,239 cases during the first seven months a year earlier.These numbers are “the highest (registered) since 2006,” WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters in Geneva.The numbers are especially worrying since only about one in 10 actual measles cases are believed to be reported worldwide, according to WHO.Measles, which is highly contagious, can be entirely prevented through a two-dose vaccine, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has in recent months sounded the alarm over-vaccination rates.Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and Ukraine registered the highest number of cases, WHO said.In Madagascar, which registered around 127,500 cases during the first half of this year alone, numbers have meanwhile dropped considerably in recent months following an emergency national vaccination campaign, the UN health agency stressed.Measles cases have soared worldwide, with the African region seeing a 900-percent jump in cases year-on-year, while cases rose 230 percent in the western Pacific.Angola, Cameroon, Chad, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Philippines, Sudan, South Sudan, and Thailand have all seen major outbreaks of the disease.The United States has meanwhile registered 1,164 cases so far this year, compared to 372 for all of 2018 and the highest number on record in a quarter-century.And in the European region, nearly 90,000 cases have been registered this year — well above the 84,462 cases registered last year.Measles — an airborne infection causing fever, coughing and rashes that can be deadly in rare cases — had been officially eliminated in many countries with advanced healthcare systems.But the so-called anti-vax movement — driven by fraudulent claims linking the MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella, and a risk of autism in children — has gained traction.WHO pointed out that the reasons for people not being vaccinated vary significantly between communities and countries, with a lack of access to quality healthcare or vaccination services hindering some from getting the jabs, while others are led astray by “misinformation about vaccines, or low awareness about the need to vaccinate.”The measles vaccine is a “safe and highly effective vaccine”, WHO stressed in a statement, urging “everyone to ensure their measles vaccinations are up to date.”Uneven vaccination coverage and gaps and disparities between communities, geographic areas, and among age-groups has allowed measles to flourish even in countries with high national vaccine rates, WHO warned.“When enough people who are not immune are exposed to measles, it can very quickly spread,” it said.© Agence France-Presse"

It’s a popular spot for Cuban residents — especially older ones — to meet daily and play dominoes.“I’m very excited,” said Silva, who felt like she had been swimming in the water around Cuba, from which she emigrated 19 years ago.Around her, the clacking of dominoes and lively conversations sounded loud in Florida’s dense, sticky heat, but she paid it no mind.Less accustomed to the climate was Alexandra Ivanovitch, who offered Silva the chance to try VR goggles.Ivanovitch, who is French, was giving a VR demonstration to Cuban retirees, transporting them to the Malecon in Havana, to outer space, to the ocean floor or the tops of mountains.Her project, called “VR Genie,” is designed to counteract the “loneliness and social isolation” that often affects the elderly, especially those who live alone or in nursing homes where there are few activities.“We use virtual reality to fulfill seniors’ wishes,” said Ivanovitch, a digital humanities doctor.Through VR, seniors can go places they’ve never been and check destinations off their bucket lists.VR Genie, which is run by the nonprofit organization Equality Lab, is funded by Miami-Dade County’s Mayor’s Age Friendly Initiative through a mini grant. The goal is to provide nursing homes with VR helmets as soon as Ivanovitch, 35, compiles a more extensive “dream library.”“We are really trying to reconnect them with the world,” said Ivanovitch.Many of the seniors she works with are no longer physically or financially able to travel on their own.“Basically, we bring the world to them,” she said.Recent studies show that virtual reality can help people deal with , anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues.“We know that things like guided imagery and meditation can be very beneficial for cognition and things of that nature, and we also know that direct behavioral interventions can be very helpful for individuals as well,” said Aldrich Chan, a neuropsychologist and research associate at the University of Miami.According to Chan, VR hits the sweet spot between the two courses of action, making its use for elderly care “really interesting research.”Chan, who also consults for Equality Lab, is responsible for quantifying the potential effects of VR use in caring for seniors, particularly the effects of virtually granting final wishes.A team from the University of California, Los Angeles, studies the use of VR to treat anhedonia, a symptom of that creates an inability to experience pleasure or interest in a range of activities.Psychiatric researcher Michelle Craske and her team are focused on providing patients with positive experiences, such as those produced by VR, and meditation in order to treat anhedonia and increase well-being.“Most treatments, up until now, have done an OK job at reducing negative (symptoms of ), but a very poor job at helping patients become more positive,” Craske told the scientific journal STAT in April.According to a study Craske published earlier this year in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, people who participated in the positive experience treatment reported lower levels of , anxiety and stress than those who participated in standard treatment, which focuses on addressing negative symptoms.With her goggles still on, Silva moved her hand gently through the air, caressing non-existent dolphins.“It takes you to another world, it really calms you down,” she said.“It’s so wonderful!”lm/to/wd/rlp© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/swine-fever-sends-chinas-pork-prices-imports-soaring/,pinalakas,1,"BEIJING, China (AFP) — Pork prices have been sent soaring and herds devastated as African swine fever tears through China’s massive pig-farming industry, forcing the country to ramp up imports to satisfy demand — but analysts warn worse is yet to come.More than 1.1 million pigs have been killed or culled so far as authorities scramble to contain a virus that has spread to neighboring countries since the first cases emerged in August 2018 and for which there is no vaccine.But the figure is widely believed to be much higher, as official data show China’s pig herd totaled 347.6 million in the first half of the year, down 60 million from the same period last year. Pork prices soared by a fifth in June alone.“The worst is yet to come,” said Jan-Peter Van Ferneij, who monitors foreign markets at the French Pork Institute.“For now it’s the numbers (of pigs) that are falling. Then it will be production… and consumption will fall,” he said.But swine fever does not affect humans and butchers have been seeking to reassure consumers that their meat is safe in the country that produces and eats more pork than anywhere else in the world.“Look at this blue stamp,” a seller at the Sanyuanli market in Beijing told AFP, pointing to the seal from health authorities showing that the pork is safe.“Here’s the certificate that goes with it,” she said.Standing in front of pork chops and ribs, Feng Shuyue recalled that people were “scared” of buying the meat last year, when the epidemic spread across the country.“Today people are not afraid at all … because the (health) controls are very strict,” Feng said.To meet demand, Beijing has increased pork imports, with shipments from the European Union rising 37 percent between January and April, according to European Commission figures.Brazil has also become a big source of imports.China is only importing frozen pork and the meat is going to larger cities, said Jan-Peter Van Ferneij, who monitors foreign markets at the French Pork Institute.Prices, meanwhile, could go up as much as 40 percent in the next six months, according to a note by Nomura bank.Authorities have sought to reassure the public.Earlier this month, agriculture officials said production was “slowly recovering”, with 44 new incidences of fever detected over the past seven months, compared with 99 from August to December last year.But the malady is far from over. Another outbreak was reported on Wednesday in southwest Sichuan province, with 21 pigs infected in a farm of 102 pigs.An April report by Dutch financial group Rabobank said African swine fever was now affecting up to 200 million pigs, and the expected 30 percent loss in pork production was almost a third larger than the annual US pork production.Transporting animals across China has helped to spread the virus.If trucks are not systematically disinfected, animals will come into contact with the disease as soon as they are transported, Van Ferneij said.Preventing the proliferation of the virus is complicated because there are many small, family-run pig herds in China.African swine fever is particularly hurting these smaller operators, said Wang Xiaoying, a professor at the Rural Development Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Industrial producers are faring better “thanks to strict preventive measures”, Wang said.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/dr-congo-urges-calm-after-ebola-case-in-key-city/,imports soaring,1,"KINSHASA, DR Congo (AFP) — Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo have appealed for calm after an evangelical preacher fell ill with Ebola in the eastern city of Goma, the first recorded case of the disease in the key urban hub in a nearly year-old epidemic.Goma, a border city with a population of one million, lies next to the Rwandan town of Gisenyi and has transport links to other parts of the DRC and beyond.The UN’s World Health Organization (WHO) described the case as a “potential game-changer” and said it would reconvene a key panel to see whether the outbreak required a heightened global response.Rwanda, meanwhile, said it would step up border monitoring and urged its citizens to avoid “unnecessary” travel to the eastern DRC.In a statement, North Kivu governor Carly Nzanzu Kasivita said the new case had been “detected at an early stage but also was isolated immediately, avoiding any further contamination.”But, he added, “I call on the population of the city of Goma and its outskirts to keep calm… (and) cooperate with response teams, by observing hygiene and prevention measures and notifying any suspected case of Ebola,” he added.According to the latest health ministry figures issued on Saturday, 1,655 people have died from the hemorrhagic virus since August 1 last year, when the disease broke out in North Kivu and spread to neighboring Ituri.Nearly 700 people have been cured, and more than 160,000 been vaccinated.But efforts to roll back Ebola have been hampered by insecurity in a region plagued by militia groups, who have attacked treatment centers.Local hostility to health workers trying to trace and isolate people in contact with Ebola patients is another hurdle.Two more Ebola workers were murdered in their homes in the North Kivu town of Beni, the ministry said.The Goma patient was described as a pastor who had been on a trip to another town, Butembo, one of the towns hardest hit by the outbreak.There, he preached at seven churches and regularly touched worshippers, “including the sick,” the health ministry said Sunday.His symptoms first surfaced last Tuesday, it said.On Friday he took a bus back to Goma from Butembo, along with 18 other passengers and the driver.He went through several health checkpoints on the road “but did not seem to show signs of the disease. However, at each checkpoint, he wrote down different family names and forenames on the passenger list, which probably indicates a will to hide his identity and state of health,” the ministry said.When he arrived back in Goma on Sunday morning, he went to a clinic because he had started to become feverish, the ministry said.“Given that the patient was quickly identified, as well as all the passengers on the bus from Butembo, the risk of the disease spreading in the city of Goma is low,” it said.The pastor was swiftly taken back to Butembo, which is better prepared for handling Ebola cases than Goma, the authorities said.The WHO said response teams had so far identified 60 people who had been in contact with the preacher, 30 of whom had now been vaccinated.In Geneva, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he planned to reconvene the agency’s emergency advisory board to assess whether the outbreak should be declared a “public health emergency of international concern” — a move that ramps up international response.“The identification of the case in Goma could potentially be a game-changer in this epidemic,” Tedros warned.The WHO panel has on three previous occasions held off making a formal emergency call for the DRC outbreak, citing the limited risk of large-scale international spread.Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which has suspended operations in the Beni-Butembo area because of the violence there, said the Goma case “shows that the situation is still worrying and the epidemic is still not under control.”Experts fret when a contagious disease occurs in a city, where contact, mobility and anonymity make it far harder to contain an outbreak than in the countryside.Goma is a border city located on the northern shore of Lake Kivu, adjacent to Rwanda.It has a port that links to Bukavu and South Kivu and an airport with flights to Kinshasa, the Ugandan capital Entebbe and Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.The driver of a motorbike taxi in Goma, who gave his name as Jean-Pierre, aged 30, said, “I hope the authorities do everything to trace these people — Goma is a huge crossroads, leading to several destinations.”The latest epidemic is the second deadliest on record globally, after the outbreak that struck West Africa in 2014-2016, killing more than 11,300 people.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/china-says-pork-production-recovering-as-swine-fever-cases-decline/,Germany makes measles vaccination compulsory for children,1,"BEIJING, China (AFP) — New cases of African swine fever have declined and pork production is returning to normal, Chinese officials said Thursday, after millions of pigs were culled because of the deadly disease.The virus — fatal to wild boar and pigs but harmless to humans — has cut a swathe through Mongolia, Vietnam, North Korea and China.The world’s top pork producer and consumer has seen prices and imports continue to rise since the August outbreak spread across the country.Around 1.16 million pigs have been killed over the past 10 months, according to official Beijing statistics, but the true figure is widely considered to be much higher.However, China has recorded only 44 new incidences of African swine fever over the past seven months compared with 99 cases from August to December last year, according to Yu Kangzhen, vice minister of agriculture and rural affairs.“Pork production is slowly recovering, but there are challenges to containing the virus,” he told reporters at a press briefing.But live pig prices have increased around 40 percent since May last year, pushing inflation to a 15-month high.The country’s pork imports also surged 63 percent in May compared with 2018, according to customs data.Despite government claims that the epidemic was “under control” analysts say the damage is being underreported.Christine McCracken, senior animal protein analyst at Rabobank, estimates that 200 million pigs could be culled in China — more than half the stock of the country, which supplies around 50 percent of the world’s pork.Yu said the government has adopted a “zero tolerance policy” to deal with local officials who failed to inspect or report outbreaks.The government has tightened biosecurity standards for pig farms to ensure that the virus is contained, he said, as well as increased scrutiny of meat processing and transporting facilities to guarantee contaminated supplies don’t end up on shop shelves.But there were still challenges in controlling the spread of the virus because China’s small farmers were ill-equipped to prevent the disease, he said.“Feeding kitchen waste to pigs is banned but its still taking place because pigs were traditionally used as a family’s garbage bin,” he said.Yu declined to comment on a timeline for conducting field trials for a vaccine to prevent swine fever, saying the research was still at an early stage."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/scientists-find-earliest-clues-of-parkinsons-in-brain/,DR Congo urges calm after Ebola case in key city,1,"PARIS, France (AFP ) — Scientists said Thursday they had found the earliest signs of Parkinson’s disease in the brain years before patients show any symptoms, a discovery that could eventually lead to better screening for at-risk people.Parkinson’s, a neurodegenerative disorder that causes patients movement and cognitive problems, is estimated to effect up to 10 million people worldwide.It is diagnosed by a build-up in the brain of a specific protein, a-synuclein, the cause of which is unclear.However some people are born with a genetic mutation that makes them almost certain to develop the disease at some stage in their life.Researchers from King’s College London compared data from 14 individuals carrying the mutation with that of 65 non-genetic Parkinson’s patients and 25 healthy volunteers.They found that changes in the serotonin system in the brains of Parkinson’s sufferers started to malfunction well before other symptoms occurred.“We found that serotonin function was an excellent marker for how advanced Parkinson’s disease has become,” said Heather Wilson, from the university’s Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience.“Therefore, brain imaging of the serotonin system could become a valuable tool to detect individuals at risk of Parkinson’s diseases, monitor their progression and help with the development of new treatments.”Suspected causes of the disease before the study included levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, and there is growing evidence of a possible link between Parkinson’s and gut function, though this is poorly understood.“Picking up on the condition earlier and being able to monitor its progression would aid the discovery of new and better treatments that could slow the loss of brain cells in Parkinson’s,” said Beckie Port, research manager at Parkinson’s UK, who was not involved in the study.“Further research is needed to fully understand the importance of this discovery, but if it is able to unlock a tool to measure and monitor how Parkinson’s develops, it could change countless lives.”The research was published in The Lancet Neurology.© Agence France-Presse"

An estimated 169 million children missed out on the vital first dose of the measles vaccine between 2010 and 2017, according to a UN report issued in April.In the US alone, the number of cases of the disease this year has exceeded a thousand, according to the latest official figures.“I guess you could call it the ‘complacency effect,'” said Khan. “If you look at those countries in our survey which have very high rates of confidence in vaccines, places like Bangladesh and Egypt, these are areas where you do have more infectious disease.“Perhaps what you see is the people in those countries can see what happens if you don’t vaccinate.”He added this contrasts with more developed countries where, “if you don’t get vaccinated, you’re still less likely to catch that infection, and if you do get infected, you might not become as unwell or might not die, because we’ve got quite good healthcare systems in place.”France was also the only country in the survey where most people (55 percent) believed science and technology would reduce jobs.“Although much more research is needed to understand why this might be the case, the sluggish performance of the French economy over the last few years may be one factor that contributes to this sentiment,” the report said. The report also found a global gender divide in self-reported levels of knowledge of science.Globally, 49 percent of men worldwide say they know “some” or “a lot” about science, compared to 38 percent of women.The gender gap existed even when men and women reported equal levels of science attainment, and was widest in the Northern European region.“What’s likely to be going on there is men are more confident or overconfident for the same level of knowledge, or equally we can say that women are under confident,” said Khan.Wellcome said it hoped its findings would provide governments a baseline to monitor how attitudes change over time and help inform policy, particularly in regards to immunization, with recent measles outbreaks demonstrating herd immunity can no longer be taken for granted."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/indian-doctors-strike-over-violence-from-patients-and-families/,Lower trust in vaccines among people in richer countries: survey,1,"NEW DELHI, India (AFP) — Tens of thousands of Indian doctors went on strike Monday calling for more protection against violence by patients and their families, as parliament met for the first time since national elections.The nationwide strike, which will last until Tuesday morning, is in solidarity with doctors in the eastern state of West Bengal after three were viciously attacked by the relatives of a man who died.The Indian Medical Association (IMA), representing 350,000 of India’s 900,000 doctors, called for tougher punishments for those assaulting medical staff.Blaming the attacks in part on “high expectations” by patients, poor infrastructure and inadequate staffing, the IMA said hospitals should have more security cameras and that the entry of visitors to hospitals should be restricted.The strike, which does not include emergency services, takes place as parliament convened for the first time since Prime Minister Narendra Modi was re-elected in a landslide last month.Doctors in West Bengal’s capital Kolkata have been on strike since last Monday, when a family assaulted three doctors after a relative died during treatment at a state-run hospital.The family, who blamed the death on negligence by the doctors, lashed out violently and left two of the medical staff critically injured.The strike in West Bengal, which has also been wracked by weeks of political violence with almost 20 people killed, has crippled medical services for the state’s 90 million people.On Monday doctors in the state were due to discuss the strike with Mamata Banerjee, the state premier and fierce Modi opponent.India spends less than two percent of its GDP on health care, making it one of the lowest investors in the sector globally, with the World Health Organization placing it below both Iraq and Venezuela.However, Modicare — a quietly successful part of Modi’s surprising re-election — is a huge public health initiative set to benefit the poorest.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-says-drc-ebola-outbreak-not-a-global-emergency/,Sanofi turns to Google in search for better treatments,1,"( The World Health Organization said Friday that the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo does not qualify as an international threat, despite the spread of the virus to neighbouring Uganda carried by an infected family.The closely-watched decision followed advice from WHO’s emergency committee, which only meets to review the world’s most severe outbreaks.The head of the UN health agency Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is in DRC reviewing the Ebola response, said he accepted the committee’s advice.“Although the outbreak does not at this time pose a global health threat, I want to emphasise that for the affected families and communities, this outbreak is very much an emergency,” Tedros told reporters.He also appealed for more funds to combat the ongoing Ebola flare-up, which has recorded more than 2,000 cases, including over 1,400 deaths, since it emerged in eastern DRC in August.Friday’s emergency committee meeting was prompted by confirmation this week of Ebola deaths in a western Uganda region that borders DRC.The WHO panel has used the label “public health emergency of international concern” only four times previously.Those included the H1N1, or swine flu, pandemic of 2009, the spread of poliovirus in 2014, the Ebola epidemic that devastated parts of West Africa from 2014 to 2016 and the surge of the Zika virus in 2016.This is the third time the WHO panel has considered — but held off — making the emergency call for this DRC outbreak, which has been concentrated in the restive provinces of Ituri and North Kivu.The head of the committee, Preben Aavitsland, told reporters in Geneva that current Ebola crisis was “an extraordinary event, with risk of international spread, (but) the ongoing response would not be enhanced” by an emergency declaration.The Uganda cases stem from a Congolese woman, married to a Ugandan, who travelled with her mother, three children and their nanny to DRC to care for her ill father, who later died of Ebola.WHO said 12 members of the family who attended the burial in Congo were placed in isolation in the DRC, but six “escaped and crossed over to Uganda” on June 9.The next day, a five-year-old boy was admitted to hospital in Bwera, a border town, vomiting blood before he died. Tests confirmed he had Ebola and the family was placed in an isolation ward.His three-year-old brother was also confirmed to have Ebola, as was their grandmother, who died late Wednesday.Speaking from western Uganda’s Kasese district, a senior Red Cross official told AFP that “the biggest challenge” was ensuring robust monitoring along the porous border with DRC.“People are continuing to come in to the country and not passing through the areas where screening is taking place, because screening has been instituted along certain points of entry but not all the points,” said Josephine Okwera, the director of health and social services for the Ugandan Red Cross.Health officials had initially hoped that they could contain the outbreak with help from a new vaccine, which has now been given to more than 130,000 people in DRC.But chronic violence and militia activity in the affected eastern DRC provinces as well as hostility to medical teams among some in the region have hampered the response.WHO has also accused political leaders in Ituri and North Kivu of manipulating the Ebola issue to turn people against health workers.Ebola spreads among humans through close contact with the blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected person.The current outbreak is the worst on record after an epidemic that struck mainly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone between 2014-2016, leaving more than 11,300 people dead.© Agence France-Presse"

The scale of the challenge posed by foodborne disease is striking, indicating the importance of preventing and mitigating risks to food safety,” said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe.“Food is a global affair with a food chain that wraps around the planet. A simple meal can easily contain ingredients from multiple continents and its safety depends on international collaboration. World Food Safety Day is an unprecedented opportunity to call on governments to strengthen the systems that guarantee safe food, across sectors and across Europe and the world.”WHO said that “unsafe food” is responsible for “millions of sick days.”It said that this can sometimes lead to lasting or severe illness, hospitalization and even death.The most frequent causes of food-borne illneses are “diarrhoeal disease agents.”The most common is norovirus with an estimated 15 million cases, followed by Campylobacter spp., which is responsible for almost 5 million cases.Non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. causes the majority of deaths. Other major causes of deaths are Campylobacter spp., norovirus, Listeria monocytogenes and Echinococcus multilocularis. Overall in the Region, diarrhoeal diseases are responsible for 94% of foodborne illnesses, 63% of related deaths and 57% of the disease burden.But there are proven ways to prevent food-borne diseases.“From handwashing, cooking and storing food properly, to surveillance and international regulation – every piece of the food safety puzzle affects lives, economies and whole communities,” Dr. Dorit Nitzan, Acting Regional Emergency Director at WHO/Europe.“World Food Safety Day is our opportunity to say out loud that it’s teamwork that will make the difference.”“Food is something people don’t think about until it goes wrong, yet unacceptable numbers of people are being subjected to the misery of foodborne illness, sometimes with serious consequences – especially for the very young and very old,” explains Dr Nitzan.The new World Food Safety Day was created by means of a resolution adopted at the United Nations General Assembly. To promote World Food Safety Day, WHO/Europe is working alongside the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Codex Alimentarius.Codex Alimentarius is a global organization that supports food safety with a collection of standards, guidelines and codes of practice established by WHO and FAO to protect consumer health and promote fair practices in the food trade."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/despite-culls-import-bans-swine-fever-to-hit-pork-market-for-years/,Despite culls,1,"HANOI, Vietnam (AFP) — Millions of pigs have been culled as African Swine Fever cuts through China and beyond, devastating global food chains, with pork prices expected to soar from the food markets of Hong Kong to American dinner tables.Outbreaks have been reported in Vietnam, Mongolia, Cambodia, Hong Kong and China — the world’s biggest pork producer and consumer.Experts warn it could take years to contain the hog-killing virus given the differing biosecurity standards on commercial pig farms and backyard smallholdings across Asia.Checkpoints, sniffer dogs and strict import bans have been deployed in a desperate bid to control its spread.But the disease has already hit most provinces in China, reducing pork production by 30 percent according to some estimates.Beijing’s official statistics say around one million pigs have been killed since the first outbreak in August last year — but that is widely considered to be an underestimate.Live pig prices are up by around 40 percent year-on-year in China, and pork imports from Europe, Canada and Brazil into the country are climbing.Beef and poultry exports are also on the rise as suppliers scramble to fill the deficit in a region where pork is the staple protein — fried, grilled, boiled and eaten by tens of millions each day in noodle bowls and rice dishes.Some Asian consumers have already started paying more for pork.And America is also soon expected to feel the pinch — likely around Christmas when people buy holiday hams.“The price impact will be sizeable,” said Christine McCracken, senior animal protein analyst at Rabobank, speaking from the US.She estimates that 200 million pigs could be culled in China — more than half the swine population in the country, which supplies around 50 percent of the world’s pork.Losing that many pigs could cause global pork supplies to dip by eight percent, McCracken said. Nguyen Van Duoc poured his life savings into raising pigs, one of hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese smallholder farmers bearing the brunt of the virus, which is not infectious in humans but has no cure or vaccine.His herd of 36 was culled after swine fever was detected at his backyard farm on the outskirts of Hanoi.“Our family is devastated,” said Duoc, who borrowed thousands of dollars to get started.“We relied on income from the pigs for my kids’ schooling,” the 50-year-old told AFP after his animals were killed and dumped into a burial pit.Along with China, Vietnam has been the worst hit by swine fever, but the country exports very little of its pork.Since its first case in February, Vietnam has culled an estimated two million pigs — over six percent of the total population — and has set up screening stations along some borders.South Korea, Japan and Taiwan have also all stepped up airport screening after ASF was brought in by travellers carrying contaminated sausages, although no pigs have been infected so far.All three countries have bumped up fines for smuggling in pork products — up to $8,400 in South Korea — and Japan has deployed sniffer dogs and quarantine stations at major airports.“We’re trying to crack down on all possible routes,” said an animal hygiene official at Japan’s agriculture ministry, declining to be named.North Korea, Cambodia, Hong Kong and Mongolia have all reported cases this year, along with Romania, Ukraine, Moldova and Russia.The outbreak has sparked calls to boost biosecurity in Asia, where most pigs are raised in backyard farms and fed food scraps — ideal virus vectors.“It’s spreading like wildfire in Asia because… the pig is the garbage truck of Asia,” said Simon Quilty, an independent meat and livestock analyst based in Australia. Experts predict it could take anywhere from two to 10 years for the virus to be fully contained in Asia, while fears are mounting of a global scourge embedding in farms with poor biosecurity standards and wild boar populations.“When a virus becomes endemic like that, we’re going to be living with this forever,” Matthew Stone, deputy director-general at the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) told AFP in Paris.That will hammer the pork industry and spin-off sectors such as the soybean business used for animal feed, Stone said, warning of “significant uncertainty” in global markets for years to come.As the virus cuts through Asia, pork imports into China have soared — shipments from the EU alone are up 20 to 30 percent, according to McCracken.But global supplies are not enough to plug the huge gap.That has opened an unexpected opportunities elsewhere.Global poultry production is expected to rise three percent this year, according to the US Department of Agriculture.Australia’s cattle farmers are also eyeing the Chinese market.But even those chicken and beef stopgaps might not be enough to feed China’s pork-hungry population.“There isn’t enough global pork available to China directly, nor is there enough other protein,” McCracken told AFP.That will deepen the misery for Chinese diners already feeling a price squeeze — as well as customers in its main exports markets like Hong Kong where the cost of imported pork has more than doubled.At a busy Hong Kong market, butcher Woo said customers can no longer afford to buy as much pork.“I’ve reduced supplies from two to one pig a day now,” he said."

He’s leading a normal life.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/worlds-tiniest-surviving-baby-born-in-california/,swine fever to hit pork market for years,1,"LOS ANGELES, United States (AFP) — A California hospital on Wednesday disclosed the birth of the world’s smallest baby ever to survive, weighing a mere 245 grams (8.6 ounces) — the same as a large apple — when she was born.The girl, nicknamed Saybie by hospital staff, was born 23 weeks and three days into her mother’s pregnancy at Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women and Newborns in San Diego.The father was told by doctors that he would have about an hour with his daughter before she passed away.“But that hour turned into two hours which turned into a day, which turned into a week,” the mother said in a video released by the hospital.Doctors said Saybie was delivered via emergency cesarean section in December at 23 weeks and three days gestation in the womb after severe pregnancy complications that put her mother’s life at risk. A typical pregnancy lasts 40 weeks.After nearly five months at the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit, Saybie was discharged home earlier this month weighing a healthy five pounds (2.2 kilograms) and sporting a graduation cap.“She is a miracle, that’s for sure,” said Kim Norby, one of the nurses who cared for Saybie as she fought to survive — with a sign by her crib that read “tiny but mighty” cheering her on.Emma Wiest, another nurse featured in the video, said Saybie was so small at birth that “you could barely see her on the bed.”At birth, she weighed as much as a child’s juice box or two sticks of butter and could fit in the palm of the hands of her caretakers.“I’d heard that we had such a tiny baby and it sounded unbelievable because I mean she’s about half of the weight as a normal 23-weeker,” Wiest said.Doctors said that apart from Saybie’s fighting spirit, her survival as a micro preemie — a baby born before 28 weeks’ gestation — could be attributed to the fact that she suffered no serious complications after birth.“Saybie experienced virtually none of the medical challenges typically associated with micro preemies, which can include brain bleeds, and lung and heart issues,” the hospital said.Saybie’s ranking as the world’s tiniest baby ever to survive is according to the Tiniest Babies Registry, maintained by the University of Iowa.The previous record was held by a baby born in Germany in 2015 who weighed seven grams more than Saybie.“Every life is a miracle — those that defy the odds even more so,” Edward Bell, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Iowa who oversees the registry, told AFP.In the video released by the hospital, Saybie’s mother said the birth was the scariest day of her life.She said she was rushed to hospital after feeling ill and was told she had preeclampsia — a condition marked by very high blood pressure that puts both the mother and baby’s lives at risk.“They had to deliver her really quickly and I kept telling them that she’s not going to survive, she’s only 23 weeks,” the mother, who did not want to be identified, said.But against all odds, Saybie did survive.She nonetheless will still face enormous challenges as a micro-preemie, including possible respiratory, hearing and vision problems.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/burn-out-is-an-occupational-phenomenon-not-disease-who/,New drug therapy slows spread of pancreatic cancer: study,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization said Tuesday that “burn-out” remains an “occupational phenomenon” that could lead someone to seek care but it is not considered a medical condition.The clarification came a day after the WHO mistakenly said it had listed burn-out in its International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for the first time.The World Health Assembly, WHO’s main annual meeting which wraps up on Tuesday, approved at the weekend the latest catalogue of diseases and injuries, collectively known as the ICD-11.While burn-out was listed in the previous version, the ICD-10, its definition has been changed in the latest edition of the text.“The definition has been modified based on existing research,” a WHO spokesperson said in an email.WHO has now defined burn-out as “a syndrome conceptualised as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed”.It said the syndrome was characterized by: “1) feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; 2) increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one’s job; and 3) reduced professional efficacy.”“Burn-out refers specifically to phenomena in the occupational context and should not be applied to describe experiences in other areas of life,” according to the definition.The updated ICD list was drafted last year following recommendations from health experts around the world.The ICD-11, which is to take effect in January 2022, contains several other additions, including classification of “compulsive sexual behaviour” as a mental disorder, although it stops short of lumping the condition together with addictive behaviours.It does however for the first time recognise video gaming as an addiction, listing it alongside gambling and drugs like cocaine.The updated list removes transgenderism from its list of mental disorders, listing it instead under the chapter on “conditions related to sexual health”."

It is not normally fatal but has been in rare cases.The man who brought in the virus arrived in Singapore on April 28, the city-state’s health ministry (MOH) said in a statement late Thursday.The 38-year-old developed symptoms two days later and is currently isolated at an infectious disease centre in a stable condition, the ministry said.Another 23 individuals who had been in close contact with the man have also been quarantined and will be monitored for 21 days.“While risk of spread is low, MOH is taking precautions,” the ministry said.Outside Africa, human moneypox infections had only been previously reported in the United States, Britain and Israel, according to the US Centers For Disease Control and Prevention.Singapore, a tiny but affluent city-state dependent on external trade and tourism, has toughened measures against infectious diseases after it was hit hard by the 2003 SARS virus outbreak.The disease killed 33 people in Singapore, inflicted major losses on the economy and hit the number of international visitors.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/scientists-develop-device-to-detect-bacteria-in-minutes-not-days/,Singapore reports first case of rare monkeypox virus,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) – The era of doctors prescribing patients powerful antibiotics while they wait for lab reports could soon be numbered, with a new device returning results within minutes instead of days.It was invented by a team at Penn State University and described in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.Co-developed by Pak Kin Wong, a professor of biomedical engineering and mechanical engineering, the device uses micro technology to trap single bacteria cells that can then be viewed under an electron microscope.The approach allows clinicians to determine in as little as 30 minutes whether bacteria is present and its susceptibility to drug treatment — as opposed to the three-to-five days such lab work currently takes.“We currently prescribe antibiotics even when there is no bacteria present,” Wong told AFP.“That is over prescription. That is one of things we tried to express. Can we quickly determine the existence of bacterial infection?”The researchers’ paper said that in addition to being able to detect whether bacteria is present, the device can begin to classify the type by determining whether the cells are spherical, rod-shaped, or spiral.“This device determines existence but not what type of bacteria it is,” said Wong. “What we’re working on is a complementary molecular approach such that we can ID the species.”And after finding bacteria is present, the sample is exposed to antibiotics to determine whether the strain is resistant, in which case antibiotic intervention would prove ineffective.“Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections,” said Wong.“However, over 75 percent of urine specimens sent to a clinical microbiology laboratory are negative. Rapidly ruling out or confirming the presence of bacteria at a clinically relevant concentration will dramatically enhance patient care.”He added that the team had applied for a provisional patent and could bring their device, which they hope to scale down in size so that it can be used in hospitals and doctors’ offices, to market in three years’ time."

The distance is relatively unimportant,” he told AFP Wednesday. “The most important part is, we were able to implement drone technology into the current system of transplantation and transportation.”Current transport methods involve expensive chartered flights or even variable commercial flights, occasionally resulting in delays, and cost typically around $5,000.According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, there were nearly 114,000 people on waiting lists for an organ transplant in the US in 2018.About 1.5 percent of deceased donor organ shipments did not make it to their intended destination while nearly four percent of organ shipments had an unanticipated delay of two or more hours.Scalea, who has founded a company that manages data for organ shipments, likened the system to an Uber-like service that would prove eventually prove less costly.© Agence France-Presse"

Of that number, half are in Africa and Asia, it noted.The guidelines – which refer to passive activities such as watching cartoons, for example, as opposed to going online to talk to a grandparent – build on data gathered in countries including Canada and Australia, which show that as many as 75 per cent of children do not have healthy lifestyles.“That takes a moment to think about,” said Dr. Fiona Bull, a Programme Manager at WHO’s Department of Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases. “Children under-five who seem to be running around and busy all day and certainly tiring their parents, may not be as active as we think.”In addition to screen time recommendations for very young children the UN health agency says that they should be physically active several times a day and get lots of sleep.“More is better,” the WHO report maintains, suggesting that carers should engage in interactive floor-based play and ensure that babies who are not yet walking spend at least 30 minutes on their stomach, rather than sitting in a chair.“The advice is where possible, to move from sedentary, passive screen time to more physical activity while at the same time protecting that very important quality sleep,” said Dr. Juana Willumsen, WHO focal point for childhood obesity and physical activity. “And what’s particularly important is that quality interactive play with a caregiver that’s so important for early childhood development…that sedentary time should also be protected.”Children aged one to four years old should be active for at least 180 minutes throughout the day, WHO says, citing walking, crawling, running, jumping, balancing, climbing, dancing, riding wheeled toys, cycling and jumping rope as suitable pastimes.For three to four-year-olds, moreover, 60 minutes of this activity should be of “moderate-to-vigorous intensity”, according to the UN agency’s guidelines, which also note that around the world, five million people die every year because they are not active enough.“Sedentary behaviours, whether riding motorized transport rather than walking or cycling, sitting at a desk in school, watching TV or playing inactive screen-based games are increasingly prevalent and associated with poor health outcomes,” says WHO’s Guidelines on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep for children under five years old.Noting the emergence of on-screen applications that help users understand how long they are spending on their devices, Dr. Bull noted that there was still much uncertainty about their health impacts.“This is a recent development and I think it is a signal that the digital industry is also wary about the addictive nature the time that’s being spent using these in different ways,” she said. “Of course, all of us are using them for work, we’re using them in schools for education, we’re using them at home for education. It’s about managing the use of these valuable tools and about watching both the benefits and the risks.”"

That baby was discharged from a Tokyo hospital in February.When Ryusuke was born on October 1, 2018, he measured 22 centimetres (8.66 inches) tall, and medical staff kept him in a neonatal intensive care unit.They used tubes to feed him, sometimes taking cotton swabs to apply his mother’s milk to his mouth.Nearly seven months later, the boy has grown 13 times in weight, now weighing over three kilogrammes. He will be released from Nagano Children’s Hospital in central Japan over the weekend.“When he was born, he was so small, and it seemed as if he would break with a touch.

https://www.eaglenews.ph/for-its-health-and-yours-keep-the-cat-indoors/,For its health and yours,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — At least one running argument among cat lovers is now over: Whiskers, Lucy and Tigger are definitely better off staying indoors, scientists reported Wednesday.Pet cats allowed outdoors, in fact, are nearly three times as likely to become infected with pathogens or parasites than those confined to quarters, they reported in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters.Two-legged house-mates should also take note because cats — a.k.a. Felis catus — can transmit some of those diseases to humans, the authors said.Intriguingly, the farther domesticated felines are from the equator, the more likely they are to be afflicted by some kind of bug or virus, if they spend time outdoors.“Each degree in absolute latitude increased infection likelihood by four percent,” said lead author Kayleigh Chalkowski, a researcher at the School of Forestry and Wildlife Sciences at Auburn University in Alabama.“You think of tropical regions as just having more wildlife, more parasites,” she told AFP. “But it turned out that latitude had the opposite effect.”To settle the indoor-vs-outdoor question once and for all, Chalkowski and colleagues combed through nearly two dozen earlier studies in which the prevalence of one or more diseases was compared across interior and exterior environments.All told, the new study looked at 19 different cat pathogens in more than a dozen countries, including Spain, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Pakistan, Brazil, the Netherland and St. Kitts.“This is the first time outdoor access as a risk factor for infection in cats has been quantified across a wide range of geographic locales and types of pathogens,” Chalkowski said.The effects were consistent for almost all of the diseases, including feline roundworm and the single-cell parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, both of which can affect humans.This held true regardless of how they were transmitted — whether from soil, other cats, or prey such as mice and birds.“Basically, no matter where you are in the world, keeping your cat indoors is a great way to keep them healthy from infectious diseases,” Chalkowski said by way of summary.This is especially good advice, she added, “considering that many of the pathogens cats carry can actually be spread to humans”.Other domesticated animals transmit disease to their caretakers — dogs, for examples, spread rabies, and cattle carry Cryptosporidium parvum, a parasitic disease that attacks the intestinal tract.Wild cats were likely first drawn to human communities in search of rodents, and were domesticated some 5,000 years ago. In ancient Egypt, they were associated with gods and prominently featured in hieroglyphics.There are some 90 million pet cats in the United States, and an estimated 500 million worldwide.© Agence France-Presse"

None proved fatal, but 21 patients required hospitalization and five were admitted to intensive care.“I urge everyone, especially those in affected areas, to get their MMR vaccines to protect their children, families and communities,” de Blasio said in a statement.“There’s no question that vaccines are safe, effective and life-saving.”That message was echoed by Dr Herminia Palacio, deputy mayor of health and human services.“When you make the decision not to vaccinate your child, please understand you’re also making that decision for the people around your child,” warned Palacio, who said her services had received reports of so-called “measles parties” held to purposely expose children to the disease.Although measles was declared officially eliminated from the United States in 2000, a total of 465 cases have been confirmed in 19 states from January 1 to April 4, according to the CDC.“This is the second-greatest number of cases reported in the US since measles was eliminated in 2000,” it said.The highest figure — 667 — occurred in 2014.The resurgence of the once-eradicated, highly-contagious disease is linked to a growing anti-vaccine movement in richer nations — which the World Health Organization has identified as a major global health threat.Most of the New York cases involved unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals, according to de Blasio’s office.The so-called anti-vax, or anti-vaxxer phenomenon has adherents across Western nations but is particularly high profile in the US, where it has been fueled by medically baseless claims spread on social media.Rockland County, located near New York City, has also declared a 30-day public health emergency over a measles outbreak there that has seen 168 people contract the disease, according to the CDC.Non-vaccinated minors in the county were banned from public places in a bid to prevent the spread of the disease, and hundreds of people have now been vaccinated, according to authorities.Patricia Schnabel Ruppert, the health commissioner there, said that since October she has been waging an uphill fight to persuade people vaccines are safe and necessary to protect the larger community.Among her daily battles: having to constantly repeat that the vaccine does not cause other diseases, that it does not lead to autism, and that the practice of using fetal tissue to produce the vaccine ended decades ago.© Agence France-Presse"

But if you go there at the very early stages, you will survive like me,” she said.Denial has been costly and bloody. Two Ebola treatment centers in Butembo and the neighboring town of Katwa were attacked in February and March. A policeman died in the violence.The center at Katwa reopened last Saturday and authorities are now trying to get locals more involved in the Ebola response drive that many see as being led by foreign aid workers.The health ministry meanwhile said sociologists and anthropologists had called for traditional chiefs to “observe rituals to appease the spirits” before the Katwa center reopened.“Confidence-building has taken place between the communities and those involved in the response programmed in areas where the most violence was recorded,” it added.Residents have asked the government and non-governmental organisations to improve the ramshackle infrastructure to provide potable water and better roads.“Ebola instills fear but people understand that it poses a danger and one must protect oneself,” said Salome, a woman living near the Katwa center.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the fight against the epidemic could take another six months."

Only three countries experienced a rise in prostate cancer deaths, according to the study findings, which were presented Tuesday at a conference in Atlanta.The United States had the biggest drop in prostate cancers, which Freeman attributed to a decline in the use of a controversial diagnostic test that identified too many non-dangerous tumors.The incidence of prostate cancers rose in the US during the 1980s and early 1990s when the PSA, or Prostate-Specific Antigen, blood test became widely available.The test is imprecise, however, and yields too many false positives. It identifies higher than normal levels of PSA, a protein produced by the prostate, which could be a sign of cancer but is more often a symptom of other diseases.Moreover, some prostate cancers are not aggressive and do not grow enough to pose a risk.A false positive, on the other hand, can have harmful consequences for the patient: anxiety, complications linked to biopsies or anti-cancer treatments.In 2012, the US Preventive Services Task Force, an expert panel that reviews the effectiveness of preventive clinical services, advised against use of the PSA test.In 2018, it revised the recommendation to say that taking the test should be an “individual” decision for men 55 to 69. At 70 and after, it advised against its use.© Agence France-Presse"

Surgeons had been waiting to find compatible patients.Martinez and the recipient of her kidney will have to keep taking their anti-retroviral medication.“The doors are now open for people living with HIV to become kidney donors,” said Segev. “Now anybody can do this anywhere in the world, provided that they screen the patients accordingly.“For us, this is not only a celebration of transplantation but a celebration of the progress of HIV care,” he said.“And the fact that 30 years ago, a disease that was basically a death sentence has been so transformed, that today somebody with HIV can save somebody else’s life.”Like other countries, the United States suffers from a shortage of donor kidneys and there is a waiting list of around 100,000 people, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.Durand said about 10,000 HIV-positive patients are currently suffering kidney failure and on dialysis.© Agence France-Presse"

The fact that exercise data was self-reported was also a potential weakness.But the large number of people covered by the research goes a long way to compensate for these methodological limitations, they added.© Agence France-Presse"

A large egg contains about 186 mg of cholesterol.The new data suggest that eating eggs increases the risk of heart attack or stroke, although the study does not establish a causal link.Still, it offers enough data to “make a strong statement that eggs and overall dietary cholesterol intake remain important in affecting the risk of (cardiovascular disease) and more so the risk of all-cause mortality,” physician Robert Eckel, of the University of Colorado, wrote in an editorial in JAMA.But as Tom Sanders, a professor of dietetics at King’s College London, points out, these results differ from a large US study published in 1999 that found no effect — like a 2013 analysis of three million adults published in the British medical journal BMJ.A recent Chinese study even concluded cholesterol decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease.Sanders thinks the new results are only relevant for the United States, where the average person eats more eggs and meat than in Europe.“Eggs in moderation — around 3 to 4 per week — is fine, and that is what current UK dietary guidelines say,” Sanders said.In France, national nutrition guidelines refute the idea that you should not eat more than two eggs a week: “You can eat them regularly.”And dietitian Victoria Taylor, of the British Heart Foundation, insists that the way you eat the egg and with what is so important.“Eating healthily is all about balance. If you’re eating too much of one thing it leaves less room in the diet for other foods that may have more health benefit.“Eggs are a nutritious food and, while this study focuses on the amount we’re eating, it’s just as important to pay attention to how the eggs are cooked and to the trimmings that come with them. For example, poached eggs on whole-grain toast is a much healthier meal than a traditional fry up.”© Agence France-Presse"

more than a four-month-old — the terrible result of her battle with measles, which is cutting a deadly swathe through Madagascar.Widespread malnutrition and low rates of immunisation on the Indian Ocean island have ramped up the killing power of the highly infectious virus.In the last six months, nearly 1,000 children have been killed by a resurgent disease that vaccination once appeared to have tamed.Now on a drip, the scrawny infant was only saved because her mother Soa Robertine, 32, made the 25-kilometre (15-mile) trek from her home to the Anivorano-nord health centre, in the island’s far north.Without her timely action, respiratory or neurological complications arising from the virus would have proved fatal, doctors said.“Frangeline is suffering severe malnutrition and she wasn’t vaccinated” against measles,” said the clinic’s head of medicine, Hollande Robisoa.“She contracted a complicated form of measles and she would have died if she hadn’t been brought here.”Many other children have not been so lucky.Between last September and February, there were more than 79,000 cases of measles in Madagascar, 926 of which were fatal, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).The Anivorano-nord clinic has had 510 patients suffering from “kitrotro” and “kisaosy” — the local names for measles.Roughly 100 patients were hospitalised but only four lost their lives, according to official statistics.But many local people dispute the numbers in a community where rumours are common.“I heard that hundreds of children have already died,” said Sylvain Randriamaro, 46, sitting in the hospital waiting room.“I was alarmed, so I decided to vaccinate my two children,” aged five and six, he said.Measles has hit Madagascar barely a year after it was gripped by an outbreak of plague that claimed 200 lives.“It’s a major epidemic,” said doctor Vincent Sodjinou, a WHO representative.“It’s down to the fact that for almost a decade the rate of vaccine coverage was not high enough and, over generations, the numbers of unvaccinated people have increased.”Measles can be relatively benign if symptoms like fever and cough are handled promptly.If not, there is a risk of “opportunistic” illness such as pneumonia or diarrhoea — diseases that can fatally attack patients with weak immune systems.In Madagascar, where 47 percent of children under five are malnourished, the disease has proved particularly dangerous.“It’s often said that malnutrition makes a bed for measles,” said Sodjinou. “The most serious cases are often reported in malnourished children.”The paediatric ward at Antsiranana’s military hospital, north of Anivorano, has been overwhelmed.“Normally we only treat one measles case here every two months,” said head of medicine Ravohavy Setriny Mahatsangy. “We’ve had 444 just since December.”Mahatsangy blamed physical contact between patients, their “reluctance to go to hospital and opposition to vaccinations”.The combination of factors has wrought a tragic toll on his patients.One example is Marie Lydia Zafisoa, aged eight, whose “mother took her to a witchdoctor… and then a traditional healer who prescribed six baths,” according to her aunt Bana Tombo.When that failed, Zafisoa’s father carried her to the clinic.“It was too late — she died on the way, on her father’s shoulders,” said Tombo.Seven-month-old Adriano Luc Rakototsioharana was more fortunate.Her grandmother Catherine had also turned to traditional medicine before taking her to hospital.She barely survived the ordeal — but even so, Catherine remains adamant that traditional medicine holds the key.“For measles, you need a cow dung infusion or a tea with bark from the lazalaza tree,” she said.Doctors say that such beliefs are frustrating their efforts to roll back the disease.“It’s the culture,” Ravohavy said, with a resigned smile.“Changing people’s mentality is far more difficult than treating measles.”The profession also complains that the situation is worsening despite the state paying for most measles treatment.“But the people prefer traditional healers who often advise them to refuse any hospitalisation,” said a health ministry official, doctor Said Borohany.“And most villages are hours away from basic medical centres.”The other viable solution, vaccinations, has been complicated by the lack of funds available for such a programme.Until now the nation’s vaccination programme has administered only a single dose when the WHO recommends two.The UN agency estimates that 5.6 million doses would be needed to contain the epidemic.But Madagascar is $1.6 million (1.42 million euros) short of the $11.2 million needed to fund such an operation.Newly-elected President Andry Rajoelina has promised to vaccinate all children aged between six months and nine years.“Our goal is to eradicate measles,” he said.But the fight will be long and difficult.“Madagascar put in place a routine vaccination programme,” said the WHO envoy, Sodjinou. “But it remains inadequate to reach the furthest reaches of the country.”© Agence France-Presse"

Treatments using the new equipment ranges from P80,000 to P300,000.“With VitalBeam, we can select the optimal treatment for every type of cancer,” said Dr. Teresa Sy Ortin, Chair of Radiology Oncology Department. “This is a breakthrough that enables us to offer a wider spectrum of advanced radiotherapy treatment options to more patients. It represents a big step forward in our ability to help people fight cancer.”Citing data from the World Health Organization, “cancer is the second leading cause of death globally and is estimated to account for 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Its 2018 Global Cancer Country Profile for the Philippines cites that more than 80,000 deaths were attributed to this deadly disease with lung, colorectal, prostate, liver, and leukemia are the most common types of cancer in men, while breast, cervix, colorectal, lung, and ovarian cancer are the most common among women."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/london-patient-second-case-ever-of-hiv-remission/,Large study again confirms MMR vaccine doesn’t cause autism,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — A second person is in sustained remission from HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, after ceasing treatment and is likely cured, researchers said Tuesday in what was hailed as proof that the condition could one day be cured.Ten years after the first confirmed case of an HIV-infected person being rid of the deadly disease, a man known only as the “London patient” has shown no sign of the virus for nearly 19 months, doctors reported in the journal Nature.Both had received bone marrow transplants to treat blood cancers, receiving stem cells from donors with genetic mutation present in less than one percent of Europeans that prevents HIV from taking hold.“It is a landmark. After 10 years of not being able to replicate (the first case), people were wondering if this was a fluke,” said lead author Ravindra Gupta, a professor at the University of Cambridge.“I think it is important to reaffirm that this is real and it can be done,” Gupta told AFP.Millions of people infected with HIV around the globe keep the disease in check with so-called antiretroviral therapy (ARV), but the treatment does not rid patients of the virus.Close to 37 million people are living with HIV worldwide, but only 59 percent are receiving ARV. Nearly one million people die every year from HIV-related causes.A new drug-resistant form of HIV is also a growing concern.Gupta and his team emphasised that bone marrow transplant — a dangerous and painful procedure — is not a viable option for HIV treatment.But a second instance of remission and likely cure following such a transplant will help scientists narrow the range of treatment strategies. “The second case strengthens the idea that a cure is feasible,” Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity and the University of Melbourne, told AFP.“We can try to tease out which part of the transplant might have made a difference here, and allowed this man to stop his anti-viral drugs.”The International AIDS Society said in a statement Tuesday that results from the second patient “reaffirm our belief that there exists a proof of concept that HIV is curable”.Mark Dybul, co-chair of the Towards an HIV Cure initiative, said the London case “is as important as it is exciting”.Both patients received stem cell transplants from donors carrying a genetic mutation that prevents expression of an HIV receptor, known as CCR5.The study describes an anonymous male patient in Britain who was diagnosed with HIV infection in 2003 and had been on antiretroviral therapy since 2012.Later that year, he was diagnosed with advanced Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, a deadly cancer.He underwent a so-called haematopoietic stem cell transplant in 2016 from a donor with two copies of a CCR5 gene variant, which is resistant to most HIV-1 virus strains.“CCR5 is something essential for the virus to complete its life-cycle and we can’t knock out many other things without causing harm to the patient,” said Gupta.“We know that CCR5 can be knocked out without any serious consequences because people are walking around without that gene.”CCR5 was the target in the genome of the controversial gene-edited twins born last year in China, whose father is HIV-positive. After the bone marrow transplant, the London patient remained on ARV for 16 months, at which point treatment was stopped.Regular testing has confirmed that the patient’s viral load remained undetectable since then.Timothy Brown, the first sustained remission survivor known as the “Berlin patient”, was given two transplants and underwent total body irradiation to treat leukaemia, while the British patient received just one transplant and less intensive chemotherapy.“I did not want to be the only person in the world cured of HIV,” Brown wrote in a medical journal in 2015, explaining why he decided to reveal his identity.Gupta said he hoped to expand research on the stem-cell transplant technique to focus on communities in Africa, where the HIV-beating mutation does not naturally occur.“Expanding remission to populations that are affected disproportionately is quite important,” he told AFP.The research team for the London patient will present their findings at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in Seattle, Washington, later on Tuesday."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/un-warns-of-complacency-as-measles-cases-soar-worldwide/,‘London patient’: second case ever of HIV remission,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Just 10 countries were responsible for three-quarters of a global surge in measles cases last year, the UN children’s agency said Friday, including one of the world’s richest nations, France.Ninety-eight countries reported more cases of measles in 2018 compared with 2017, and the world body warned that conflict, complacency and the growing anti-vaccine movement threatened to undo decades of work to tame the disease.“This is a wakeup call. We have a safe, effective and inexpensive vaccine against a highly contagious disease — a vaccine that saved almost a million lives every year over the last two decades,” said Henrietta Fore, executive director of UNICEF.“These cases haven’t happened overnight. Just as the serious outbreaks we are seeing today took hold in 2018, lack of action today will have disastrous consequences for children tomorrow.”Measles is more contagious than tuberculosis or Ebola, yet it is eminently preventable with a vaccine that costs pennies.But the World Health Organization last year said cases worldwide had soared nearly 50 percent in 2018, killing around 136,000 people.Ukraine, the Philippines and Brazil saw the largest year-on-year increases in cases. In Ukraine alone there were 35,120 cases — nearly 30,000 more than in 2017.Brazil saw 10,262 reported cases after having none at all the year before.While most of the countries that experienced large spikes in cases are experiencing unrest or conflict, France saw its caseload jump by 2,269.The resurgence of the disease in some countries has been linked to medically baseless claims linking the measles vaccine to autism, which have been spread in part on social media by members of the so-called “anti-vax” movement.The WHO last month listed “vaccine hesitancy” among the top 10 most pressing global health threats for 2019.“Almost all of these cases are preventable and yet children are getting infected even in places where there is simply no excuse,” Fore said.“Measles may be the disease, but all too often the real infection is misinformation, mistrust and complacency.”Other nations included on UNICEF’s top 10 list of cases increases were Yemen, Venezuela, Serbia, Madagascar, Sudan and Thailand.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/study-finds-potential-new-weapon-in-fight-against-malaria/,UN warns of ‘complacency’ as measles cases soar worldwide,1,"TOKYO, Japan (AFP) — For years, insecticide-soaked mosquito nets have helped dramatically lower malaria infections, but insecticide resistance has driven a search for alternatives and a new study may have uncovered one option.The weapon is a familiar one: an anti-malarial drug already used by humans to prevent them contracting the disease, and researchers now envisage using it on netting like insecticides.Their research shows the drug works on mosquitoes, killing the malaria parasite in the insects and preventing it from being transmitted.It is a potentially important breakthrough in the battle against a disease that killed 435,000 people in 2017, the majority of them children under five in Africa.In 2017, the number of malaria cases climbed to 219 million, a worrying rise from the previous year and a sign that long-standing progress is being reversed.The researchers, including Flaminia Catteruccia, a professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard University, found exposing mosquitoes to even low doses of an anti-malarial called atovaquone or ATQ caused “full parasite arrest”.“We tested a couple of anti-malarials, and it worked beautifully with ATQ: all parasites were killed!” Catteruccia told AFP by email. The team was initially looking for ways to sterilize female mosquitoes that had developed insecticide resistance, to prevent resistance spreading.But when they found that the compounds they were testing also affected the malaria parasites inside the mosquitoes, they shifted their focus.“We then thought, if we can attack parasites with non-specific chemicals, why don’t we try to kill them more effectively with anti-malarials,” Catteruccia said.They settled on ATQ because like insecticides it can penetrate the “skin” of mosquitoes when they land on nets.The team, whose research was published Thursday in the Nature journal, tried to simulate the conditions in which insects land on nets.They fed two groups of mosquitoes with malaria-infected blood and then exposed one group to surfaces coated with ATQ.Just six minutes of contact with the surface — around the time the insects would usually spend on a net trying to land a bite — wiped out the malaria parasites in the mosquitoes.The control group mosquitoes that weren’t exposed to ATQ however “showed a high prevalence and intensity of (malaria) infection”, the study said.The drug even worked to prevent mosquitoes contracting malaria parasites when the insects came into contact with the drug 24 hours before eating infected blood.The researchers said computer modelling showed their novel approach would “substantially mitigate the global health effects of insecticide resistance” in the fight against malaria. “We are quite excited that this new idea could really help in the fight against malaria in a manner that is safe for people that sleep under those nets and for the environment,” Catteruccia said.But the researchers acknowledge that significant work is needed before anti-malarials can be used directly against mosquitoes, and there are risks.Mosquitoes are unlikely to develop resistance to ATQ because it doesn’t affect their survival or reproduction, but when it comes to the malaria parasites “emergence of resistance is always a risk”, Catteruccia said.The prospect of an ATQ-resistant strain of malaria is particularly problematic because the drug is a key plank in treating the disease in humans.To tackle that problem, the researchers propose investigating other drugs that kill the malaria parasite in different ways.“By using different drugs in humans and in mosquitoes, we could reduce the chance of drug resistance emerging,” said Catteruccia.The team will also need to look at the cost of using the drug, and how stable it would be over time when exposed to the elements on a net.And the path to international acceptance will be long, wrote Janet Hemingway, a professor of vector biology at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.“Substantial hurdles must be overcome before a product is generated that is recommended and universally accepted by funders, countries and communities for use in control programs,” she wrote in a review of the research commissioned by Nature.There are also other factors at play in the growing number of malaria infections, experts say, including a decline in funding for campaigns against the infection and a related drop in the use of insecticide-treated nets."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/us-health-experts-say-measles-resurgence-unacceptable/,US health experts say measles resurgence ‘unacceptable’,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — US public health experts sounded the alarm Wednesday over a resurgence of measles in recent years, principally in communities where people reject vaccinations and obtain exemptions for religious or “personal” reasons.Six outbreaks of the disease have been reported in the United States since January 1, totalling 159 cases, in the states of Washington, Colorado and New York.Since 2000, between 50 or several hundred cases have been reported a year, even though the highly contagious disease was declared eradicated at the start of the century.Its return is “really unacceptable,” said Antony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, during a congressional hearing. “We need to get to zero.”The virus is one of the most contagious known. It can linger in a room or on a surface for up to two hours after the infected person has left.In most American measles epidemics, the virus has been imported by travelers returning to the United States, the disease being highly active in many other countries.It then propagates among un-vaccinated people, who tend to live close to each other.“There are pockets of people who are vaccine hesitant,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), told the lawmakers.In the past five years, 12 of the 26 US measles epidemics — an epidemic is defined as more than five people infected — occurred in “close knit communities,” she said.Three quarters of the cases are concentrated in such communities. Examples include an outbreak in the Somali community in Minnesota in 2017, and in the Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn last year.Disinformation about vaccines is a factor, the experts stressed, blaming social networks for spreading false information about the risks of vaccination. Recently, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest, under pressure from Congress, announced measures to block anti-vaccine content.The MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella is “incredibly safe,” Messonnier said. Since it was created in the 1960s, millions and millions of doses have been administered, with sore arms the most frequent side effect.“We are a victim of our own success,” said Messonnier.As the number of measles cases has dropped by 99 percent since the 1960s, parents have become less attentive to the risks posed by the disease.Measles once claimed 400 to 500 lives a year in the United States. Besides fever, tiny red spots and other symptoms, complications from the disease include ear infections (1 in 10 cases); pneumonia (1 in 20 cases); and encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain (1 in 1,000 cases).To obtain “herd immunity” — in which unvaccinated people are protected by the high proportion of others who are vaccinated — requires vaccinating between 92 and 95 percent of the population, Fauci said.The national rate of vaccination for children is at about that level, but there are big disparities among states, and from one city or school to another.The most flagrant example of that is Clark County, a jurisdiction just north of Portland, Oregon, where 65 of 159 cases of measles in the United States are concentrated.Fifteen years ago, 96 percent of five-year-old students in the county were vaccinated against measles. In the 2017-2018 school year, the proportion had fallen to 84 percent.In some schools, especially private schools, the MMR vaccination rate was as low as 20 or 30 percent.Washington state lawmakers have reacted by advancing legislation that would eliminate exemptions for personal or philosophical reasons. The opt-out for religious reasons would remain. Other states are also considering similar action.In the United States, only three of the 50 states — California, Mississippi and West Virginia — allow exemptions only for medical reasons.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/nearly-half-of-children-with-cancer-untreated-study/,Nearly half of children with cancer untreated: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Some 45 percent of children with cancer are left undiagnosed and untreated, according to an innovative study of the disease’s global footprint among under-15s, published Wednesday.Worldwide, there are some 400,000 new cases of childhood cancer each year, but barely half are logged in national health registries, researchers reported in The Lancet Oncology, a medical journal.“The patients will almost certainly die, although cancer will not be listed on a death certificate,” noted Eva Steliarova-Foucher, a scientist at the UN-backed International Agency for Research on Cancer, commenting on the study.Sixty percent of countries do not even have cancer registries, and of those that do may only cover a fraction of the population.The new method for calculating disease burden also incorporates data from the World Health Organization’s Global Health Observatory, along with health and household surveys developed by UNICEF.Researchers took into account general levels of access to primary care and referrals to specialized care.“Our model suggests that nearly one in two children with cancer are never diagnosed and may die untreated,” said lead author Zachary Ward from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.“While under-diagnosis has been acknowledged as a problem, this model provides specific estimates that have been lacking.”As with many diseases, the disparity between rich and developing nations is stark.The survey of data from 200 countries shows that more than half of childhood cancer cases in Africa, south-central Asia and the Pacific Islands slip through the healthcare net.By contrast, only three percent of cases are undiagnosed in the United States, Europe and Canada.The number of new cases in 2015, the most recent year analyzed, was stable or declining in most regions, but remained highly concentrated — 92 percent — in low- and middle-income nations.The most common non-adult cancer that year in most parts of the world — with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa — was acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which affects white blood cells.“Health systems in low- and middle-income countries are clearly failing to meet the needs of children with cancer,” said senior author Rifat Atun, a professor at Harvard University.“Universal health coverage — a target of UN Sustainable Development Goals — must include cancer in children as a priority to prevent needless deaths,” he said in a statement.The authors estimate that there will be 6.7 million new cases of childhood cancer worldwide between 2015 and 2030.Of these, nearly three million will go undetected unless health systems improve rapidly.Barriers to access and referral in healthcare systems remains a major problem and account for a large portion of undiagnosed cancer cases in children, the researchers said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/nearly-50-of-transport-pollution-deaths-linked-to-diesel-study/,Nearly 50% of transport pollution deaths linked to diesel: study,1,"FRANKFURT AM MAIN, Germany (AFP) — Some 385,000 people worldwide died prematurely in 2015 from air pollution caused by vehicle exhaust emissions, a US study found Wednesday, which singled out diesel engines as the main culprit.Diesel vehicles were responsible for 47 percent of the deaths, it said, but the figure jumped as high as 66 percent in France, Germany, Italy and India where diesels make up a large proportion of cars on the road.The study was carried out by researchers from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) — the non-governmental group that blew the whistle on Volkswagen’s “dieselgate” emissions cheating scandal in 2015 — and two US universities.“The high public health burden of diesel vehicles in Europe underscores the need for world-class emissions standards to be accompanied by robust compliance and enforcement,” said ICCT co-author Joshua Miller, calling for urgent action to replace high-emissions vehicles.In the wide-ranging study, researchers looked at the emissions from diesel and non-diesel cars, trucks, buses, the shipping industry as well as agricultural and construction machinery and their impact on our health.They found that the global transportation sector was responsible for 11 percent of the 3.4 million premature deaths annually attributed to pollution from fine particles (PM2.5) and ground-level ozone exposure.The cost of the health burden caused by transport pollution, which has been linked to lung and heart diseases, strokes and diabetes, added up to $1 trillion (880 billion euros) in 2015, they said.In China alone, some 114,000 people were killed by vehicle exhausts that year, but that still only accounted for just over 10 percent of all deaths linked to air pollution there.The United States saw 22,000 deaths from transport pollution, of which 43 percent were linked to diesels.India meanwhile recorded 74,000 premature deaths from vehicle exhausts, compared with 13,000 in Germany, 7,800 in Italy and 6,400 in France.Relatively speaking however, the picture was worst in Germany with 17 premature deaths blamed on transport pollution per 100,000 residents — three times higher than the global average.Milan, Turin, Stuttgart, Kiev, Cologne, Berlin and London were among the deadliest cities in terms of transport pollution, the researchers noted.The authors cautioned that their estimates were “conservative” as their study did not take into account all types of harmful emissions or pollution-linked diseases.“Consideration of these impacts would likely increase the estimate of health impacts from vehicle exhaust emissions,” they warned."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/diabetics-stock-up-on-insulin-over-brexit-fears/,Diabetics stock up on insulin over Brexit fears,1,"LONDON, United States (AFP) — Diabetics and insulin providers in Britain are stockpiling the precious medicine to avoid potential shortages in case Britain leaves the European Union without a deal in just over month’s time.“I started about two months ago,” David Burns, a 37-year-old teacher living in London, told AFP.“I used to pick up insulin once a month. Now I’m picking it up about once every two weeks and I am just going to keep doing this until I can be reassured that it is going to be OK.“But it’s likely we are heading for a no-deal Brexit and our country is in a very precarious position.”Many of Britain’s 3.7 million diabetics, who include Prime Minister Theresa May, depend almost entirely on insulin imports from continental Europe.The hormone, which is usually produced by the pancreas, helps diabetics regulate their blood-sugar levels.A no-deal Brexit would almost certainly mean re-establishing customs and health controls, which could lead to delays at the border.London and Brussels have both said they want to avoid this scenario but nerves are fraying as the March 29 departure date looms.“We definitely do hear that people are making sure that their stocks are a bit higher than usual,” Robin Hewings, chief policy officer at Diabetes UK, told AFP.Hewings played down fears of a “national shortage” but warned that there could be localised issues.Suppliers in Britain have tried to get ahead of the problem, exceeding the government’s recommendation to have enough inventory to last six weeks.Novo Nordisk, which supplies more than half of the insulin used in Britain, has doubled its reserves.“We will continue to build stock ahead of 29 March when we expect to have around two and a half times our normal stock levels (roughly 17 weeks) in readiness for a potential no-deal Brexit,” the group said.French group Sanofi, which produces insulin near Frankfurt, Germany, has also stocked up on drugs in Britain, including enough insulin to last 16 weeks.US firm Eli Lilly, another insulin producer, said it had “done everything in its power to prepare for Brexit” but warned that “circumstances outside of our responsibility may disrupt medicines supply”.“A no-deal Brexit would result in the UK’s complete and sudden disassociation from decades of partnership with the EU on medicines regulation and drug safety monitoring,” it added.Diabetes UK and another group, JDRF, have called on the government to provide more details on its preparations in case of a no-deal.They point out that in addition to insulin, people with diabetes use other drugs and imported products such as needles, insulin pumps, and devices used to measure blood glucose levels.The health ministry has sought to reassure those affected, and has welcomed the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry.“We are confident that, if everyone does what they should do, the supply of medicines will be uninterrupted in the event of a no-deal,” a ministry spokesman told AFP.The ministry’s plans include fast-track emergency medicine deliveries by sea and by air in case of congestion at the border.But not all patients are comforted by the government’s words.“If I don’t have insulin then I would go immediately to hospital because, you know, I could be sick in a matter of days and dead in a matter of weeks,” said Burns.“This is not something I want to test.”© Agence France-Presse"

Of the 844, 528 deaths had resulted.The epidemic can only be declared over when the country has not recorded any new case of Ebola for 42 consecutive days.International health experts are helping the DRC but efforts are being hampered by violence in the region, where militia groups are rampant.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/vaccine-could-virtually-eliminate-cervical-cancer-study/,Vaccine could virtually eliminate cervical cancer: study,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — The rapid scale-up of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine could virtually eliminate cervical cancer in a handful of rich countries within three decades, and in most other nations by century’s end, researchers said Wednesday.Without screening and HPV vaccination, more than 44 million women will likely be diagnosed with the disease over the next 50 years, they reported in The Lancet Oncology, a medical journal.Two thirds of these cases — and an estimated 15 million deaths — would occur in low- and medium-income countries.By contrast, the rapid deployment starting in 2020 of screening and vaccination could prevent more than 13 million cervical cancers by mid-century worldwide, and lower the number of cases to below four-per-100,000 women, the study found.“This is a potential threshold for considering cervical cancer to be eliminated as a major public health problem,” the authors said in a statement.Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 570,000 new cases worldwide in 2018, making it the fourth most common cancer for women after breast, colon and lung cancer.The disease claims the lives of more than 300,000 women every year, mostly in lower income nations.“Despite the enormity of the problem, our findings suggest that global elimination is within reach,” said lead author Karen Canfell, a professor at the Cancer Council New South Wales, in Sydney.Achieving that goal, however, depends on “both high coverage of HPV vaccination and cervical screening,” she added.Transmitted sexually, HPV is extremely common and includes more than 100 types of virus, at least 14 of them cancer-causing.The viruses have also been linked to cancers of the anus, vulva, vagina and penis.It takes 15 to 20 years for cervical cancer to develop in women with normal immune systems. If the immune system is weak or compromised — by HIV infection, for example — the cancer can develop far more quickly.Clinical trials have shown that HPV vaccines are safe and effective against the two HPV strains — types 16 and 18 — responsible for 70 percent of cervical cancer cases.The study’s projections presume the vaccination of 80 percent of girls 12 to 15 years old starting in 2020, and that at least 70 percent of women undergo screening twice in their lifetime.This would push the prevalence of the disease below the bar of 4/100,000 women in countries such as the United States, Canada, Britain and France by 2059, and in mid-income countries such as Brazil and China by 2069, the authors calculate.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/who-warns-of-backsliding-in-measles-fight-as-cases-soar/,WHO warns of ‘backsliding’ in measles fight as cases soar,1,"GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP) — The World Health Organization warned Thursday that efforts to halt the spread of measles were “backsliding”, with case numbers worldwide surging around 50 percent last year.The UN health agency pointed to preliminary data showing that the disturbing trend of resurgent measles cases was happening at a global level, including in wealthy nations where vaccination coverage has historically been high.“Our data are showing that there is a substantial increase in measles cases. We’re seeing this in all regions,” Katherine O’Brien, WHO’s director of immunization, vaccines, and biologicals, told reporters in Geneva.“We’re having outbreaks that are protracted, that are sizable and that are growing,” she said. “This is not an isolated problem.”O’Brien pointed out that less than 10 percent of actual measles cases are reported.“So when we see the reported cases increased by 50 percent, we know that we’re heading in the wrong direction,” she said, adding that the true number of infections was “in the millions”.Countries have until April to report measles cases registered in 2018 to the WHO.But the agency said the data it has received so far showed that around 229,000 cases had already been reported, compared to 170,000 for 2017.Last year, measles caused approximately 136,000 deaths around the world, according to WHO’s preliminary figures.Measles is a highly contagious disease, which can cause severe diarrhea, pneumonia and vision loss and can be fatal in some cases, and remains “an important cause of death among young children,” according to WHO.This is frustrating since the disease can be easily prevented with two doses of a “safe and efficient” vaccine that has been in use since the 1960s, the UN agency said.Up until 2016, the number of measles cases had been steadily declining, but since 2017 the number has soared, according to Katrina Kretsinger, who heads WHO’s expanded immunization programme.“There are a number of outbreaks … which are driving some of these increases,” she told reporters, pointing to significant outbreaks in Ukraine, Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad and Sierra Leone.In Madagascar alone, “from October 2018 through 12 February 2019, a total of 66,278 cases and 922 deaths have been reported,” WHO said.In poorer countries, marginalized communities and states in conflict, lacking access to the vaccine is the problem.In Europe and other wealthy areas, meanwhile, experts blame the problem in part on complacency and misinformation about the vaccine.The resurgence of the disease in some countries has been linked to medically baseless claims linking the measles vaccine to autism, which have been spread in part on social media by members of the so-called “anti-vax” movement.“We’re backsliding on the progress that has been made,” O’Brien said.“And we’re not backsliding because we don’t have the tools to prevent this. We do have the tools to prevent measles,” she said.“We’re backsliding because of the failure to vaccinate.”© Agence France-Presse"

But just how it metabolizes glucose can reveal a lot about the brain’s metabolic age.Subjects ranged from their 20s to 80s, and across those age spans, women’s brains appeared metabolically younger than men’s, said the findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a peer-reviewed US journal.A machine-learned algorithm showed that women’s brains were on average about 3.8 years younger than their chronological ages.And when compared to men, male brains were about were 2.4 years older than their true ages.“It’s not that men’s brains age faster,” said senior author Manu Goyal, assistant professor of radiology at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis.“They start adulthood about three years older than women, and that persists throughout life,” said Goyal.But why?One theory is that hormones might begin shaping brain metabolism at a young age, setting females on a pattern that is more youthful throughout their lives, compared to men.Scientists hope to find out if metabolic differences in the brain may play a protective role for women, who tend to score better than men on cognitive tests of reason, memory and problem solving in old age.It “could mean that the reason women don’t experience as much cognitive decline in later years is because their brains are effectively younger,” said Goyal.More work is underway to confirm and better understand the implications of the research.© Agence France-Presse"

https://www.eaglenews.ph/obesity-linked-cancers-on-the-rise-in-young-adults/,Obesity-linked cancers on the rise in young adults,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — A sharp increase in the rate of obesity-linked cancers among young adults in the United States could foreshadow a reversal in the overall decline in cancer mortality, researchers warned Monday.In a sweeping study covering two-thirds of the US population, they showed that half a dozen cancers for which obesity is a known risk factor became more frequent from 1995 to 2015 among women and men under 50.The younger the age bracket, the more quickly these cancers gained ground, they reported in The Lancet, a medical journal.During the period examined, the incidence of pancreatic cancer, for example, increased by about one percent per year for adults aged 45 to 49. Among 30 to 34-year-olds, the average annual percent increase was more than twice that high.And among 25 to 29-year-olds, the rate jumped by 4.4 percent per year.Comparing five-year age brackets from 25 to 80, the annual hike was similarly highest among the 25 to 29 cohort for four other obesity-linked cancers: kidney (6.23 percent), gallbladder (3.71 percent), uterine (3.35 percent), and colon (2.41 percent).“Our findings expose a recent change that could serve as a warning of an increased burden of obesity-related cancers to come in older adults,” said co-author Ahmedin Jemal of the American Cancer Society, USA.Obesity has more than doubled in the United States over the last four decades. It has also risen sharply in other rich nations and, more recently, the developing world. Today, some two billion people are overweight or obese.With few exceptions, cancer has been seen as a disease of ageing.Indeed, the researchers note that the number of new cancer cases reported remains much higher in older age brackets, even if the rate of increase is now highest among young adults.Two pancreatic cancer cases, for example, were diagnosed among every 100,000 24 to 49-year-olds from 2010 to 2014, compared to 37 cases for every 100,000 people aged 50 to 84.Overall, the number of people in the United States who succumb to cancer has declined.From 1980 to 2014 — when cancer claimed some 20 million lives — mortality dropped by 20 percent, from 240 to 192 deaths per 100,000 people, due in part to reduced tobacco use.“But in the future, obesity could reverse that progress,” Jemal cautioned.“Obesity is now one of the most preventable causes of cancer in the US and UK — around 1 in 12 cases in the US are caused by excess weight, and more than 1 in 20 in the UK.”Building on earlier research suggesting a link between obesity and more frequent colon cancers in young adults, Jamel and colleagues analysed all cancer cases from 1995 to 2015 in 25 US states home to 67 percent of the population.The data covered 30 types of cancer, 12 of which had previously been linked to obesity. For five of the 12, the rate of increase for new cases was highest in the youngest age group, and for a sixth — a form of bone marrow cancer called multiple myeloma — the biggest jump was among adults in their early 30s.Of the other 18 types of cancer, only two showed a similar trend, with the others either stable or — for those related to smoking and infection — in decline.“The investigators speculate that these findings are driven in part by the obesity epidemic, a hypothesis that is both provocative and plausible,” Catherine Marinac from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard University’s Brenda Birmann commented, also in The Lancet.Still unexplained, however, is why the six other forms of cancer classified by the UN’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as related to obesity did not also show similar rates of increase among younger adults.The authors called for more aggressive screening for obesity by front-line doctors, and called on them to warn patients about the cancer risk of being seriously overweight.Currently, less than half of primary care physicians in the US regularly measure the body-mass index (BMI) of their patients.“The quality of the American diet has worsened in recent decades,” said lead author Hyuna Sung, also of the American Cancer Society.More than half of 20 to 49-year-olds eat far too little fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and too much salt, fast food and sugary drinks, she said."
https://www.eaglenews.ph/almost-half-of-americans-have-heart-disease-study/,Almost half of Americans have heart disease: study,1,"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Almost half of Americans have heart disease, a significant increase over prior years largely because of a newly expanded definition of high blood pressure, the American Heart Association said Thursday.The report in the journal Circulation found that 121.5 million adults in the United States in 2016 “have some type of cardiovascular disease.”By definition, cardiovascular disease includes coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke and high blood pressure.In 2017, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology updated the definition of high blood pressure as a reading of 130/80 mm Hg. Before, it was 140/90 mm Hg.If high blood pressure were excluded from the new statistics, just nine percent of US adults (24.3 million in 2016) would be classified as heaving cardiovascular disease.“As one of the most common and dangerous risk factors for heart disease and stroke, this overwhelming presence of high blood pressure can’t be dismissed from the equation in our fight against cardiovascular disease,” said Ivor Benjamin, volunteer president of the American Heart Association and director of the Cardiovascular Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.“Research has shown that eliminating high blood pressure could have a larger impact on cardiovascular disease deaths than the elimination of all other risk factors among women and all except smoking among men.”Heart disease is the world’s leading killer, taking 17.6 million lives in 2016.The global toll was down slightly from 2015, when 17.9 million lives were lost from heart disease.In the United States, the numbers are moving in the opposite direction.“After decades of a steady decline in the US, cardiovascular disease deaths are on the rise (840,678 deaths in 2016 up from 836,546 in 2015),” said the report.About 80 percent of cardiovascular diseases can be prevented, through healthy lifestyle choices like diet, exercise, maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking; and by controlling high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol, the AHA said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/lowering-blood-pressure-cuts-risk-of-cognitive-impairment-study/,Lowering blood pressure cuts risk of cognitive impairment: study,1,"TAMPA, United States (AFP) — Aggressive treatment to lower blood pressure in older people has been shown to cut the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment, a risk factor for dementia, US researchers said Monday.While the findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) did not find any significant impact on the likelihood of developing dementia, experts said the trial offers a glimmer of hope as the world’s population ages and dementia becomes a growing concern.Dementia, including its most common, form, Alzheimer’s disease, is expected to affect 115 million people worldwide by 2050.So far, the world’s best scientific minds have not found a way to reliably prevent, cure or treat dementia.But some research has suggested that high blood pressure — which affects three-quarters of people over 75 — might be a modifiable risk factor.For the the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), more than 9,300 people aged 50 and older with high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure of between 130 and 180 mm Hg) were randomized to receive different interventions.Some received intensive blood pressure control, with medications that targeted 120 mm Hg.Others aimed for a more standard treatment goal of less than 140 mm Hg.Patients were followed for about five years and given a battery of cognitive tests.In the intensive treatment group, 149 participants were deemed to have probable dementia, compared with 176 participants in the standard treatment group.In other words, the intensive blood pressure control “did not significantly reduce the incidence of probable dementia,” said the study.However, researchers were cautiously optimistic about a secondary finding, that mild cognitive impairment occurred in far fewer participants in the intensive treatment group — 287 compared to 353 participants in the standard treatment group.“This is the first trial, to our knowledge, to demonstrate an intervention that significantly reduces the occurrence of MCI, a well-established risk factor for dementia,” said the study.An accompanying editorial in JAMA by Kristine Yaffe of the University of California, San Francisco, also emphasized the possibility that more research could confirm the technique as an effective prevention strategy.“For older adults, almost all of whom have concern about being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia, SPRINT MIND offers great hope,” she wrote.“The study demonstrates that among those with hypertension, intensive SBP control can reduce the development of cognitive impairment.”She called for studying the approach along with other vascular health efforts, such as physical activity, and prevention.Maria Carrillo, chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Association, which is funding a two-year extension of the study to further probe any effects on dementia, called the findings “the strongest evidence to date about reducing risk of mild cognitive impairment through the treatment of high blood pressure.“MCI is a known risk factor for dementia, and everyone who experiences dementia passes through MCI,” Carrillo added.“However, the study’s outcome on reducing risk of dementia was not definitive,” hence the need for more research, she said.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/radical-rethink-needed-to-tackle-obesity-hunger-climate-report/,‘Radical rethink’ needed to tackle obesity,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — To defeat the intertwined pandemics of obesity, hunger and climate change, governments must curb the political influence of major corporations, said a major report Monday calling for a ‘global treaty’ similar to one for tobacco control.Bu this will not happen unless ordinary citizens demand a “radical rethink” of the relationship between policymakers and business, nearly four dozen experts from The Lancet Commission on Obesity concluded.“Powerful opposition from vested interests, lack of political leadership, and insufficient societal demand for change are preventing action,” they said in a statement.Nearly a billion people are hungry and another two billion are eating too much of the wrong foods, causing epidemics of obesity, heart disease and diabetes.Unhealthy diets account for up to 11 million premature deaths every year, according to the most recent Global Disease Burden report.“Malnutrition in all its forms — including undernutrition and obesity — is by far the biggest cause of ill-health and premature deathy globally,” said Commission co-chair Boyd Swinburn, a professor at the University of Aukland.“Both undernutrition and obesity are expected to be made significantly worse by climate change.”The way in which food is currently produced, distributed and consumed not only fuels the hunger and obesity pandemics, it also generates 25 to 30 percent of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.Cattle production alone accounts for more than have of those gases, in the form of methane-laden flatulence and CO2 when forests — especially in Brazil — are cleared to accommodate livestock.A transport system dominated by cars contributes another 15 to 25 percent of emissions, and supports a sedentary lifestyle.“Underpinning all of these are weak political governance, the unchallenging economic pursuit of GPD growth, and the powerful commercial engineering of overconsumption,” the report said.“Undernutrition is declining too slowly to meet global targets, no country has reversed its obesity epidemic, and comprehensive policy responses to the threat of climate change have barely begun.”Despite 30 years of warnings from science about the dire impacts of global warming, CO2 emissions hit record levels in 2017 and again last year.Because all these problems are interwoven, the answers must be too, the researchers emphasised.“Joining three pandemics” — hunger, obesity, climate — “together as ‘The Global Syndemic’ allows us to consider common drivers and shared solutions.”Another Lancet Commission report published last week calling for a dramatic shift in global diet to improve health and avoid “catastrophic” damage to the planet.“Until now, undernutrition and obesity have been seen as polar opposites of either too few or too many calories,” said Swinburn.“In reality, they are both driven by the same unhealthy, inequitable food systems, underpinned by the same political economy.”The report calls for a Framework Convention on Food Systems — similar to global conventions for tobacco control and climate change — to restrict the influence of the food industry.The experts also argue that economic incentives must be overhauled.Some five trillion dollars (4.4 trillion euros) in government subsidies for fossil fuels and large-scale agribusiness should be rechanneled toward “sustainable, healthy and environmentally friendly activities,” they said.To sharply reduce red meat consumption, for example, the report favours high taxes, abolishing subsidies, along with transparent health and environment labelling.In addition, they favour the creation of a one billion dollar philanthropic fund to support grassroots action.“Tackling ‘The Global Syndemic’ requires an urgent rethink of how we eat, live, consume and move,” said Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet.The two Lancet reports are not the only urgent appeal from science in recent months. In October, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change likewise called for an economic and social “paradigm shift” to avoid global chaos.Reaction to the Lancet recommendations has been sharply divided. Health advocates and climate experts hailed its sweeping call for deep change.“For too long we have been day-dreaming our way to a diseased future,” said Katie Dain, CEO of the Noncommunicable Disease Alliance.“A food system that secures a better diet for this and the immediate next generations will save millions of lives and, at the same time, help save the planet.”Industry representatives and libertarians slammed the findings as overwrought and an assault on free choice.“This is the final vindication for those of us who have warned about the slippery slope of regulation,” said Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the London-based Institute of Economic Affairs.“Nanny-state zealots are no longer hiding their intention to use the anti-tobacco blueprint to control other areas of our lives.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/bleeding-risks-may-offset-aspirins-benefit-vs-heart-disease/,hunger,1,"TAMPA, United States (AFP) — Should healthy people take aspirin to ward off heart disease? The notion has been controversial, and the medical advice mixed.But a review of scientific data on the topic Tuesday showed that any benefits are slight, and are counterbalanced by a matching rise in bleeding risks.Aspirin is a blood thinner and can help prevent clots that may lead to heart attack or stroke. But aspirin also boosts the risk of hemorrhage in the brain, stomach, and intestines.“When considering the totality of evidence, cardiovascular benefits associated with aspirin were modest and equally balanced by major bleeding events,” said the report in the Journal of the American Medical Association.The meta-analysis examined 10 prior studies involving a total of more than 164,000 people with an average age of 62.Comparing aspirin users to those who don’t take aspirin, researchers found “significant reductions” in strokes, heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease among those who took aspirin.Aspirin use was also linked to an increased risk of “major bleeding events compared with no aspirin,” it said.Statistically, the benefits were close to the risks.If 10,000 people without heart disease took no aspirin for a year, 61 of them would have a heart attack or stroke, explained Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at The Open University.If 10,000 similar people took aspirin for a year, 57 of them would have a heart attack or stroke.“Only four fewer in 10,000, but that still has some importance given how common such diseases are and how serious cardiovascular disease is,” said McConway, who was not involved in the study.Heart disease is the top killer of people worldwide, taking 17.9 million lives around the planet each year, for one-third of all deaths, says the World Health Organization.“The downside is the increase in major bleeding events, including bleeding inside the skull and brain or major bleeds in the stomach or gut,” added McConway.In a non-aspirin-taking pool of 10,000 people, 16 would have such an event in a year, compared to 23 among aspirin-takers.In other words, about seven more major bleeds annually, which McConway described as a “substantial increase,” even though the annual risk of a hemorrhage “is still not high.”According to Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director of the British Heart Foundation, the meta-analysis “valuably updates our knowledge, but does not change the current perspective.“It confirms that the average risk of harm exceeds benefit, so that guidelines should not be changed.”Aspirin is not recommended in Britain for prevention of heart disease.But in the United States, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends “initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10 percent or greater 10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years.”According to a recent nationwide survey of US adults, about half reported regular aspirin use.Sean Zheng, a cardiologist at King’s College Hospital and lead author of the JAMA report, said the public may not understand that taking low-dose, or baby aspirin, carries significant risks.“In my opinion, there is no place for routine use of aspirin in patients who are healthy,” he told AFP.“Maybe it’s because it’s over the counter and it’s described as a baby aspirin, but actually our data show that there is a very real risk, and you shouldn’t take it with the expectation that it’s completely benign and safe.”The study also delved into aspirin’s preventive benefits when it comes to cancer, and found “no overall association between aspirin use and incident cancer or cancer mortality.”The review pointed out one study that had found a 15 percent reduction in cancer death associated with aspirin use after five years of follow-up.However, the same findings were not replicated in a second trial, which followed almost 500 patients for seven years.“The findings of this study suggest that the association of aspirin with cancer outcomes is neutral, with no suggestion of harm or benefit from the available current evidence,” said the JAMA report.© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/chinas-ageing-elite-live-golden-years-in-style/,climate: report,1,"BEIJING, China (AFP) — At a gated community for Chinese senior citizens, retired military personnel, film-makers, and top university professors settle into a new routine: ballet lessons, weightlifting and catered dining.As China’s population ages rapidly and the one-child policy left parents with only a single child to help them in their old age, the upper crust of Chinese society are spending the last years of their lives in luxury.A grand piano backlit by floor-to-ceiling windows stands in the Yanyuan community’s clubhouse living room. Brightly colored artworks commissioned from Israeli artist David Gerstein adorn public spaces.“This is our home now,” said Li Ying, a 71-year-old resident who spent more than 30 years in the military. “Special circumstances notwithstanding, we are prepared to live here until the end.”Though high-end institutions like Yanyuan, which boasts an on-site hospital and on-call staff, are still few in China, they are part of a growing industry as the country races to develop enough elderly care support for its exploding population of senior citizens.By 2050, one in three people in China, or 487 million people, will be over the age of 60 -– more than the population of the United States — according to the official Xinhua news agency.In the past, parents could count on their children for care in their twilight years under Chinese traditions of filial piety.But as China reckons with its one-child policy, which was aimed at curbing population growth, Chinese couples are now burdened with raising their own children while supporting both sets of parents — without the help of siblings.“The idea that children should take care of their ageing parents is an old logic spanning thousands of years,” explained Li. “As society develops, this is changing.”To tackle the country’s looming ageing crisis, the Chinese government is trialing a number of policies, including preferential tax policies for elderly care service providers.The push to grow China’s elderly care capacity has encouraged more private companies, from real estate developers to insurance firms, to seize on business opportunities in the industry, such as nursing homes where residents enjoy five-star accommodations and professional medical support.At Yanyuan, which is run by insurance giant Taikang, residents can either buy into the company’s two million yuan ($290,000) pension plan or make a down payment of one to two million yuan ($145,000 to $290,000) on top of monthly living expenses of at least 6,000 yuan ($870), not including the food budget.Publicly-run nursing homes, on the other hand, can cost less than $1,000 a month or offer subsidies to residents but are often viewed as a last resort for China’s more destitute senior citizens.“Whether or not China’s elderly care industry can satisfy the needs of (China’s) rapidly ageing populace depends on who is paying for it,” says Chen Youhua, a professor at Nanjing University who has studied China’s elderly care industry.If it’s paid for privately, there could be an overabundance of facilities and beds, but “if it’s the government or society who pays… then the current elderly care services industry cannot satisfy such needs”, he added.Some industry experts are wary that private firms will focus on providing lavish retirement villages for long-term residency, rather than creating last-mile nursing homes for those who cannot take care of themselvesVivian Lou, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong, who studies long-term care suggested healthy 60-year olds could enter such villages for seniors, and remain there for 20 years, during which time no one else could take their spot.“This then becomes a housing solution,” she explained.Still, for residents at Yanyuan, socializing with peers — and simply not being alone — is one of the greatest benefits of staying in the retirement community.In the past, the entire family lived together, “joyous and harmonious,” said Ge Ming, who heads operations at Yanyuan. “But over the course of urbanization, the (family) structure has changed”.Young workers from all over China migrate from rural areas in search of higher wages and work opportunities — they are no longer home to care for their parents or grandparents.For China’s ageing elite, many of whom already live in the major cities, their children may be living overseas or simply too busy building their own high-powered careers to look after relatives.“I can’t rely on them,” said Zhu Mingyi, an 82-year-old retired professor, who used to teach languages.His daughter lives in Beijing working for an international broadcaster, while his son is in Japan.He added: “They have their own careers and family. They don’t have the time, money, or energy to take care of you.”© Agence France-Presse"
https://www.eaglenews.ph/in-china-unhappiness-tracks-poor-air-quality/,Bleeding risks may offset aspirin’s benefit vs heart disease,1,"PARIS, France (AFP) — Eye-watering, throat-scratching air pollution is a major driver of big city blues in China, according to a study published Monday that matched social network chatter with fine-particle pollution levels.“The take-away is simple,” lead author Siqi Zheng, an associate professor at MIT and director of the University’s China Future City Lab, told AFP.“Higher levels of air pollution lower people’s happiness in the world’s most populous country.”Dirty air is not the only blight on life in urban China, which is also plagued by soaring housing prices, worries over food safety, and poor public services.But health-wreaking pollution — especially microscopic bits from coal-fired power plants and factories that settle in the lungs — is a long-standing gripe of the country’s burgeoning middle class.More than a million premature deaths every year in China can be chalked up to air pollution, the World Health Organization and other research groups have concluded.A toxic cocktail of small and larger particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3) is likewise linked to poor cognitive performance, labour productivity and educational outcomes.On polluted days, people are also more likely to engage in impulsive and risky behaviour they may later regret, observational studies have shown.Awareness of the problem and its consequences is very high among China’s city dwellers, a fact not lost on the government.After an embarrassing episode in 2012 when daily pollution levels published on Twitter by the US embassy in Beijing were consistently higher than official figures for the city, China’s leaders declared war on smog-clogged air.They set up hundreds of monitoring stations throughout the country, and introduced more stringent standards, especially for small particles less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) in diameter.The average human hair is 60-to-90 microns in width.According to the new rules, the density of these dangerous microscopic particles should not exceeded 35 microgrammes per cubic metre (35 mcg/m3) for any 24-hour period.WHO Air Quality Guidelines are even more strict, setting the limit at 25 mcg/m3.China’s most heavily polluted cities — including Beijing and Tianjin, home to more than 35 million — particle density are often two, three and even four times higher than either standard.To gauge how urban air pollution affected day-to-day mood, Zheng and colleagues used machine-learning algorithms to comb through more than 200 million messages from 144 cities posted in 2014 on China’s largest microblogging site, called Weibo.As of mid-2018, Weibo, similar to Twitter, had 455 million active users.The researchers devised an “expressed happiness index” based on key words and context, and then stacked it up against fluctuating PM2.5 pollution levels.“We found a significant negative correlation” — when one went up, the other went down — “between pollution and happiness levels,” Zheng said.“Women were more sensitive to higher pollution levels than men.”Average daily PM2.5 concentration was 55 mcg/m3 across all 144 cities — more than double the WHO limit — and several times higher in many.More than half of China’s population — nearly 700 million people — now live in urban areas.Intriguingly, the link was strongest in the very cleanest and dirtiest cities examined.People very worried about health and air quality tend to move to cleaner cities, the study suggested, while those in the dirtiest urban areas were more aware of damage to their health.“Our index has the potential to become a tool for government to understand common citizens’ daily concerns,” Zheng said.The Chinese government, in fact, has long monitored posts and conversations on social networks to track public opinion.Since 2013, PM2.5 particle pollution has dropped on average about 40 percent, according to one recent study, but ground-level ozone pollution continues to climb.© Agence France-Presse"

It is the third leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the country after diseases of the heart and the vascular system, according to the Department of Health.Globally, cancer is the second leading cause of death, and is responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer.The DOH has set the third week of January as National Cancer Consciousness Week to promote awareness about this disease.When cancer begins, it produces no symptoms. It can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests, and is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. There are over 100 types of cancers that affect humans, according to the National Cancer Institute.To know more about this disease, we have this infographics prepared for you."

https://www.eaglenews.ph/hong-kong-scientists-claim-broad-spectrum-antiviral-breakthrough/,INFOGRAPHICS: National Cancer Consciousness Week,1,"HONG KONG, China (AFP) — Hong Kong scientists claim they have made a potential breakthrough discovery in the fight against infectious diseases — a chemical that could slow the spread of deadly viral illnesses.A team from the University of Hong Kong described the newly discovered chemical as “highly potent in interrupting the life cycle of diverse viruses” in a study published this month in the journal Nature Communications.The scientists told AFP Monday that it could one day be used as a broad-spectrum antiviral for a host of infectious diseases — and even for viruses that have yet to emerge — if it passes clinical trials.The spread in recent decades of sometimes deadly bird flu strains, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) have underscored the need for new drugs that can work more quickly than vaccines.Broad-spectrum antivirals are seen as the holy grail because they can be used against multiple pathogens.In contrast, vaccines usually only protect against one strain, and by the time they are produced the virus may have mutated.The HKU team tested their chemical “AM580” on mice in a two-year study and found it stopped the replication of a host of flu strains — including H1N1, H5N1 and H7N9 — as well as the viruses that cause SARS and MERS.It also stopped the replication of the mosquito-borne Zika virus and Enterovirus 71 which causes hand, foot and mouth disease.“This is what we call a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, which means it can kill a number of viruses,” microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung, who led the team, told AFP.“This is quite important in the early control of an epidemic.”The study is part of a growing body of research by virologists to find drugs that avoid targeting a virus directly — something which could lead to resistance. Instead they look for compounds that interrupt the way viruses use crucial fatty acids, known as lipids, within a host’s cells to replicate.“This study is science in progress -– an early step in an exciting new direction,” said Benjamin Neuman, an expert on viruses at Texas A&M University-Texarkana who has published his own studies on starving viruses of lipids.“Viruses are totally dependent on supplies stolen from their hosts, and a number of recent studies have shown that treatments that interrupt the steady flow of lipids in an infected cell are highly effective at blocking a wide range of viruses,” he told AFP.The next step is to test the drug on a wider variety of animals, including pigs and primates, before pushing to clinical trials, a process Yuen said could take up to eight years.The HKU team have applied for a patent in the United States.A derivative of AM580 is already being used in Japan to treat cancer, raising hopes that it will show low toxicity for humans.But Neuman warns there are drawbacks.Like many chemotherapy methods used to fight cancer, antivirals such as AM580 damage a person’s cells to starve a virus. While cells can heal, much research still needs to be done on how and when to use such techniques.“Unless the treatment is targeted very carefully, the potential for side effects would be very worrying,” he said.Densely populated Hong Kong has first-hand experience of deadly viral outbreaks.In 2003, nearly 300 people died from SARS and the city’s densely packed apartment blocks are considered hugely vulnerable to future outbreaks.© Agence France-Presse"
