https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/27/ust-singers-madrigal-singers-loboc-childrens-choir-sing-philippines-youth-conquer-the-world/,"UST Singers, Madrigal Singers, Loboc Children’s Choir, Sing Philippines Youth conquer the world","Easily one of the top newsmakers during the last week of September 2024 is the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Singers, who won the Grand Prize at the 2024 Grieg International Choir Festival held in Bergen, Norway.The UST Singers is the first Filipino and Asian ensemble to win the top prize in the competition’s tenth edition. This choral feat includes winning first place in the Mixed Choir category, besting nine other choirs from Norway, Sweden, Latvia, Poland, and Slovakia.The Filipino choir narrowly missed another top prize in the Folk Music category, losing by just a few points to the Czech Republic’s winning score.Founded in 1992 by Prof. Fidel G. Calalang Jr., the UST Singers are a mixed choral ensemble of students and alumni from various colleges of Asia’s oldest university, the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas (UST).Other choral triumphs include winning Choir of the World Championships in UK and a grand prize at the Florence International Choral Competition in Italy.The ensemble’s winning program includes a Filipino repertoire, which includes the award-winning Sagayan by Nilo Alcala. The piece is based on traditional Southern Philippines kulintang music.The UST Singers acknowledged the composer of their winning piece Sagayan: “Without that piece, our victory would not have been possible.”The winning years of the UST Singers, however, didn’t come easy.Calalang recounted once: “Those years could be described as arduously inspiring but, in sum, very colorful and fulfilling. The first few steps were difficult. Just like any other organization or institution, the first few years are always tough, but as we went along, the fruits of our labor and hard work paid off.”In the very beginning, Calalang made sure the choir’s repertoire was varied and not focusing on just one genre or period. He also considered the different types of audience that they performed for, and made an extra effort to make their repertoire appealing to them.“I stayed away from the common notion that choral music is confined to Church repertoire and, therefore, perceived as boring,” Calalang said. “I have to keep myself updated on the changing trends, innovations, and developments of choral music around the world. I am blessed to have been given talented singers and members with varied but positive personalities. Perhaps the mix of singers that I always get sets us apart from other choirs. The sundry personalities, different voice qualities, and assortment of talents create a distinctive kind of choir that is always a big challenge to a choir conductor.”Looking back, the first international newsmaker for choral competitions is, of course, the Philippine Madrigal Singers, also known as The Madz, founded in 1963 by Prof. Andrea O. Veneracion, now a National Artist for Music. In 1997, The Madz under Andrea O. Veneracion also won the grand prize in the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing in town of Tours, France, besting five other grand prize winners of the most prestigious choral competitions in Europe: the Guido d’Arezzo in Italy and its equivalent in Varna (Hungary) and Tolosa (Spain). One member of the jury described The Madz as the “most beautiful sound on earth.”Under the baton of Mark Anthony Carpio on August 26, 2007, The Madz won, for the second time, the grand prize in the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing in Arezzo, Italy. This made The Madz the first of the only four choirs in the world to win the grand prize twice.The show stealer in the recently concluded 2024 Gawad CCP Para Sa Sining is the Loboc Children’s Choir, composed of 30 schoolchildren of the Loboc Central Elementary School in Loboc, Bohol.The Loboc Children’s Choir was founded in 1980 at the Loboc Central Elementary School in Loboc, Bohol. It won the National Music Competition for Young Artists twice. In 2002, it bagged a gold medal in the Europe Song Festival, and again in 2003, for getting the highest mark in all categories.Acknowledging the CCP recognition, the Loboc Children’s Choir musical director Alma Taldo and conductor Lea Claudia Cal said: “We are grateful for having been bestowed with the remarkable honor of being named one of the recipients of the esteemed Gawad Cultural Center of the Philippines Para Sa Sining. It is with immense pride and gratitude that we accept this prestigious award.”The Gawad CCP Para Sa Sining stands as a symbol of recognition for artists and groups who have consistently demonstrated excellence and innovation in their respective art forms.In 2022, the Sing Philippines Youth Choir (SPYC) under the direction of Mark Anthony Carpio placed second in the Classical Mixed & Equal Category, and also won the Gold Diploma in the Ethnic Category, during the Busan Choral Festival and Competition (BCFC) in Busan, South Korea.The membership of the SPYC is unique. Its members come from four batches, made up of 213 singers from 56 local communities in the country. Their talents were honed through music camps and sustained regional workshops.SPYC was launched in 2014 with support from the Philippine Madrigal Singers and the Cultural Center of the Philippines Outreach Program.The Sing Philippines movement brought to life the vision of National Artist for Music Andrea O. Veneracion, who dreamed of a nation singing in harmony and united in songs.In the Ethnic/Traditional category, where it won the gold diploma, the winning choir performed Tatlong Awiting Pambata, Ang Alibangbang by Saunder Choi, Dandansoy arranged by Fidel Calalang, and Three Kalinga Chants by Nilo Alcala.Four other Philippine choral groups also won prizes in the Busan competition—namely, the Villanueva Chorale of Misamis Oriental, the Imusikapella of Cavite, the Balanga Choral Artists, and the Bataan Peninsula State University Chorale.The winning streak of Philippine choirs doesn’t surprise the Philippine Madrigal Singers’ choir director Mark Carpio.Carpio credits National Artist Veneracion for instilling the value of hard work among choir members.“As Prof. Veneracion has pointed out in the past, nothing is more enjoyable than to see our hard work pay off. The objective of competition is not to win. It is just a means for us to get better,” Carpio said.Carpio, who once sat in the jury of the Busan choral festival and competition, pointed out that there is no such thing as an ideal sound in any choral competition. “The sound that the choir always tries to maintain is a free and relaxed sound, but at the same time versatile and flexible. I believe there is no ideal or perfect sound for a choir. I have made this conclusion after listening to so many choirs from different countries of different cultures and ages. Each one sounds good but different from each other. There are qualities that are common to choirs. They are homogenous, and the different voice parts are well-balanced. This is what conductors find very challenging.”In 2021, Kammerchor Manila (KM) under conductor Anthony Go Villanueva bagged the Grand Prix and the Best Conductor Prize in the Queen of the Adriatic Sea Choral Festival and Competition in Italy. Its winning piece was Dan Forrest’s “Entreat Me Not To Leave You.”The competition was streamed online from June 4 to 6, 2021, and saw the Philippine choir beating participants from equally excellent choirs of Armenia, Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Italy, Japan, Poland, UK, USA, and Russia.Kammerchor Manila was founded in 1992 by Prof. Fidel Calalang, who is also behind the internationally acclaimed UST Singers.The Aleron Choir received the Grand Prize in the 10th Busan International Choral Festival and Competition. It won over 38 other choirs from eight countries, including the Czech Republic, Russia, and Colombia.Aleron Choir conductor Christopher Amado Ong Arceo said the victory was the result of hard work: “It takes a lot of diligence and insight from both the conductor and the choristers. It all boils down to finding that meaning in the material and to be able to transfer it through sound that makes a winning performance, whether in a competition or a concert setting. The preparations are rigorous, from training the voice to balancing each section, arriving at an interpretation that each one can own with sincerity, to nurturing their psyche and sustaining their faith in themselves and one another through camaraderie and fellowship. The work never ends until you get the ideal sound.”The Ateneo Chamber Singers (ACS) under Jonathan Velasco was another prizewinner. It was declared champion in the Musica Sacra category and earned the gold medal in the Mixed Chamber category at the 8th World Choir Games in Riga, Latvia. The festival attracted approximately 27,000 participants from 400 choirs from 73 countries.At the 60th Certamen Internacional de Habaneras y Polyfonia held in Torrevieja, Spain, the ACS won First Prize in the Habaneras category, the competition’s most coveted prize.The ACS conductor observed: “We were winning gold in choral Olympics since the early ’80s but, sad to say, it is the boxers and the beauty queens and the athletes who get national attention.”"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/27/nilo-alcala-choir-song-composer/,Nilo Alcala: Choir song composer,"For Sagayan composer Nilo Alcala, a composer-singer writing for the voice truly understands how the vocal mechanism works and would know what would work and what would not.Alcala, a former member of The Madz, further explained: “A composer-singer writing an instrumental work will probably craft very cantabile passages as melodies. One advantage for me while I was still singing with The Madz was having this resource of being able to hear my creation performed in its best possible interpretation, as well as getting feedback from learned, musical, and well-meaning colleagues in the group. A composer learns a lot from hearing the notes he just previously imagined, probably more than by reading a book on composition. He learns even more when he gets feedback from highly musical and well-trained performers.”Alcala likes to think there’s probably something in his own musical language that he can share with music lovers worldwide.The prizewinner of the Asian Composers League Competition held in Jerusalem and Israel said: “When composing, my first goal is to write something that I myself would love to hear, yet would also resonate well with the performers. I would have in mind a governing concept, idea, theme or material and follow whatever sonic devices would ‘serve’ it. I always think of the specific performer that the work is being written for—their strengths (and possible weaknesses). I always try to make the piece a worthwhile and enjoyable endeavor for the ensemble.”"

The 8th Indie-Siyensya Filmmaking Competition, organized by the Department of Science and Technology-Science Education Institute (DOST-SEI), has officially premiered, bringing together filmmakers and audiences to explore the rich interplay between science and Filipino culture. Simultaneous film screenings in different Cinematheque Centres nationwide from October 14-18 were attended by students, teachers, filmmakers, and other members of the local government unit. In collaboration with the Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP), the competition showcases a diverse array of films that will be screened at various Cinematheque Centres across the country (Manila, Iloilo, Negros, Davao and Nabunturan) from October 14 to 18 and will be available online through the streaming platform JuanFlix on October 19 to November 8, 2024.The 8th Indie-Siyensya seeks to utilize the power of storytelling through film to communicate essential scientific concepts to the public.It premieres at Cinematheque Centres Davao City and Nabunturan in Davao de Oro, with a program attended by members of the board of judges—Science Communicator and University of the Philippines Los Baños Senior Lecturer Dr. Ruby Cristobal, University of Santo Tomas Creative Writing Department Head Dr. Joselito delos Reyes and UPLB Professor and Scientist Dr. Aimee Lynn Dupo.“For the past six years, the FDCP and Indie-Siyensya of the DOST-SEI have had this really fruitful partnership. The correlation between science and filmmaking are practically indivisible because the advancements done in the art and technology of filmmaking is highly dependent on science,” said Jose Javier-Reyes, chairman and CEO of the FDCP. This year, the competition features two distinct categories: the Youth Category and the Open Category.The Youth films focus on uncovering science within Filipino culture, highlighting evidence-based indigenous practices and traditions.The Open Category, on the other hand, explores how Filipino culture informs and integrates science and technology into everyday life.Among the hundred entries in the Open Category is by Heather Simonette Rose M. Intong, a captivating documentary that delves into the extraordinary diving abilities of the Badjaos (Sama Dilaut) in Simunul, Tawi-Tawi leaving a lingering question to the audience whether this tribe should let their tradition be swept by the passing tides of time or use their adaptive nature to keep up with a fast-paced society. Another notable entry, by Mondrayniel F. Sarte, brings the viewers to the picturesque Twin Lakes Natural Park in Negros Oriental, shedding light on the harmonious relationship between traditional ecological knowledge and modern conservation efforts.Through interviews and expert observations, the film illustrates how “,” plays a crucial role in protecting this vital ecological resource.Meanwhile, by Dexter Paul De Jesus and Drexler Jaramel, explains the role of and the culture of using herbal plants in traditional healing, as modern science transforms these medicinal plants into modern drug formulations. by John Rafael C. Labini is a captivating documentary that explores the tradition of naming winds in Malaban, Binan, Laguna.Through a compelling blend of folklore and science, the film uncovers the significance of these wind names to the local fishing community and their connection to the environment. Additionally, by Gian Arre highlights the intricate weaving tradition of Indang, Cavite, showcasing the scientific principles inherent in this age-old craft, while emphasizing the cultural significance of the weaving process.In the Youth Category, films like by Julia Gabrielle P. Salonga and by Anjalique Rendon dive into the sustainability of traditional practices, with focusing on the benefits of architecture and examining the cultural and scientific aspects of betel nut chewing among the Dumagat-Remontados. by Eula Frances A. Macabodbod explores the historical and cultural significance of the Pulangi River in Valencia, Bukidnon, while by Lloyd Zedric B. Apacible reflects on the rich history tied to the local delicacy, . by Xandre Yosef Gaan further bridges tradition and science by connecting the beliefs of the Talaandig tribe with scientific insights.Dr. Ruby Cristobal, a science communicator and member of the board of judges also stressed that as the scientific community continues to push the boundaries of knowledge, we must always acknowledge our roots and embrace our diverse cultural heritage. Culture, she pointed out, is not separate from science—it is integral to who we are as a people. The Indie-Siyensya competition not only highlights the creativity of Filipino filmmakers and science communicators but also underscores the importance of integrating cultural heritage and scientific knowledge for the betterment of society.As DOST-SEI and FDCP continue to forward these initiatives, they invite audiences to reflect on the essential connections between art, science, and Filipino identity."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/24/children-youth-most-vulnerable-to-e-cigarettes-online-study/,"Children, youth most vulnerable to e-cigarettes online—study","Social media posts from e-cigarette brands in the Philippines feature marketing tactics that predominantly appeal to children and young people, a new study has revealed.A report by the Johns Hopkins University Institute for Tobacco Control found that these posts heavily rely on marketing strategies like emoticons (70 percent), cartoons (19 percent), influencer and celebrity endorsements (nine percent), and depictions of partying (four percent).Brands also employed engagement techniques commonly used for consumer products, including user interaction (39 percent), co-marketing (28 percent), contests and giveaways (19 percent), influencers (eight percent), and monetary promotions such as discounts (six percent).More than half (53 percent) of the posts did not feature any health warnings, while 47 percent only included text warnings rather than graphic images.Age inconsistencies were also highlighted in the study, as almost half of the posts (45 percent) mentioned a 21-and-above age restriction, while one-third (34 percent) failed to specify any age limit.Another 12 percent used general prohibitions, such as “not for sale to minors,” while 10 percent mentioned an 18-and-above restriction.REPUBLIC Act 11900, also known as the Vape Law, prohibits the sale and promotion of vape products within 100 meters of areas frequented by minors. It also bans the use of flavor descriptors and cartoon characters in the packaging and marketing of these products.However, the study revealed a troubling trend in online promotions. Many vape shops continue to advertise products with flavors appealing to children, including concept flavors (57 percent), fruit flavors (56 percent), sweets (29 percent), and mint (23 percent), all packaged with colorful designs.In August, health organizations criticized the transfer of regulatory authority over vapes from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) under the Vape Law.Child rights advocates have raised concerns over the Vape Law’s reduced age restriction for e-cigarettes from 21 to 18, and its allowance for online sales and marketing, which they argue exposes more young people to the dangers of nicotine addiction.THEY also condemned what they described as tobacco industry “propaganda,” which promotes vaping as a safer alternative for smokers. They claim this marketing strategy has contributed to an alarming increase in nicotine addiction among school-aged children in the Philippines.The country recorded its first death linked to E-cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI) in May this year. The victim, a 22-year-old male with no prior health issues, suffered a fatal heart attack after a severe lung injury tied to his two-year vaping habit.In light of such cases, advocates are calling for the restoration of child protection measures that were removed by the Vape Law, urging the government to return regulatory oversight to the FDA, raise the minimum age for purchasing both e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes to 21, and ban flavored e-cigarettes, online marketing, and advertising altogether.The study examined over 5,500 publicly visible e-cigarette posts in the Philippines between August 2022 and January 2023."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/24/sweden-phl-partnership-to-revolutionize-cancer-care-in-bataan-and-beyond/,Sweden-PHL partnership to revolutionize cancer care in Bataan and beyond,"Sweden and the Philippines have formed a strategic partnership to enhance cancer care in the Philippines. This collaboration will focus on raising awareness, promoting prevention, enabling early detection, and improving access to innovative treatments.The province of Bataan will be the launching pad for this new era of cancer care, setting a benchmark for the entire Philippines.“Sweden and the province of Bataan are partnering up in cancer care, where our key ambition is really to support the government of Bataan to transform cancer care, to have it ideally a benchmark for nationwide adoption, so that we could copy whatever we do in Bataan and apply it to the different provinces,” said Lina Balsyte, Business Sweden Healthcare Lead for Southeast Asia.She added that they want to start in a small geographic unit to ensure their efforts have a real impact.THE Sweden-Philippines partnership in cancer care was formalized through a Letter of Intent (LOI) signing ceremony held last October 18, 2024, in Makati City, witnessed by the State Secretary to the Minister for International Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade of Sweden, Håkan Jevrell and Dr. Jan Aura Llevado, Chief, Cancer Control and Mental Health Divisions, Department of Health.“Under Sweden’s strategy for trade, investment and global competitiveness and its new and long-term promotion initiative in Asia, Sweden is strengthening its engagement in the Philippines with a capacity-building agenda across several industries,” said Jevrell.“Cancer has emerged as one of the leading causes of mortality in the Philippines, with lung cancer leading in males and breast cancer in females. And as a global leader in cancer care, Sweden is confident that this partnership will contribute to enhancing cancer care in the Philippines and ultimately improving patients’ access to healthcare,” he added.Bataan Governor Jose Enrique Garcia III said the cancer care partnership with Sweden complements Bataan’s role in implementing the national government’s universal health coverage rollout.“We’re thrilled to be the pilot province for this collaboration and look forward to leveraging Sweden’s expertise in cancer management to enhance patient outcomes, alleviate pressure on the healthcare system, and deliver health and socio-economic benefits to Bataan,” added Garcia.GARCIA said the collaboration with Sweden will also incorporate IT and AI solutions, facilitated by Ericsson, to enable remote access to specialized cancer care, connecting patients to Bataan General Hospital and Medical Center (BGHMC), the apex facility for cancer treatment in the province.“This innovative approach will ensure that every ‘Bataañeno’, regardless of their location, can receive the care they need,” said Garcia.He pointed out that Sweden’s expertise in early detection, telemedicine, and AI will definitely help improve cancer outcomes in Bataan.“Additionally, I believe we are exploring a grant for a Linear Accelerator which would bring advanced radiation therapy to our province, significantly enhancing our ability to treat cancer. This letter of intent marks the beginning of a transformative journey for Bataan,” added Garcia.AS THE leading healthcare institution in the province, BGHMC is dedicated to advancing cancer care across all stages in Bataan. This includes early detection and diagnosis, health promotion, cancer prevention, cancer surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, as well as palliative care and pain management.Dr. Glory V. Baltazar, BGHMC Medical Center Chief II, said they aim to start the partnership by creating a comprehensive cancer registry. They also look forward to working with Swedish cancer specialists known for their expertise and patient-centered care.The Sweden-Philippine partnership follows the quadruple-helix model, fostering collaboration among government, academia, industry and civil society in both countries. The LOI was signed by the Provincial Government of Bataan, Bataan General Hospital, Business Sweden – The Swedish Trade & Invest Council, Cancer Coalition Philippines, AstraZeneca, Elekta, and Ericsson.The three industry partners, AstraZeneca, Elekta, and Ericsson, intend to further drive their commitment to the healthcare sector in the Philippines.“Our team at AstraZeneca is inspired by our ambition to provide cancer cure through our life-changing medicines, alongside partnerships that allow early detection, diagnosis, and equitable care for Filipino patients with cancer,” said Lotis Ramin, AstraZeneca Philippines Country President.As a world leader in telecommunications and technology, Ericsson brings global experience in utilizing mobile connectivity to accelerate digital transformation in industries, such as healthcare. “In particular, 5G connectivity has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of healthcare and enhance patient outcomes, such as telesurgery and remote diagnostics. We have seen this in our partnerships with leading health institutions worldwide,” said Daniel Ode, Head of Ericsson Singapore, Philippines, and Brunei.“We are looking forward to working with the partners in this initiative to bring Sweden’s leadership and expertise to enable remote healthcare to the Philippines,” he added.Leader in precision radiation therapy, Elekta, aims to contribute to the improved cancer center workflow and enhanced user experience to simplify complex cancer care.“Our purpose at Elekta is to provide hope for everyone dealing with cancer, we envision a world where everyone has access to the best cancer care,” said Samuel Lee, Elekta Managing Director SEA.“Through this partnership, we aim to elevate the level of radiation therapy treatment techniques through collaborating with healthcare institutions on introducing advanced radiation therapy technologies and educational programs to upskill clinicians working in the field of radiotherapy,” shared Lee.The goal of the Sweden-Philippines cancer care partnership is to foster collaboration in cancer prevention, early detection, treatment, research, and capacity building between Sweden, the Philippines, and international partners."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/24/filipinos-must-prioritize-bone-health-dost-advises/,"Filipinos must prioritize bone health, DOST advises","The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) emphasized the need for Filipinos to take care of their bones in light of the growing risk of osteoporosis in the country.In observance of World Osteoporosis Day last October 20, DOST Secretary Renato Solidum said that one of the most effective ways to prevent the condition that weakens bones is through adequate calcium intake.“Calcium is an essential nutrient for maintaining bone strength. However, many Filipinos do not meet the recommended levels of calcium in their diet, increasing the risk of developing brittle bones,” he said in a statement.Based on the 2021 Expanded National Nutrition Survey conducted by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute, nine out of 10 Filipino adults and seniors do not meet the recommended calcium levels in their diet, increasing their risk of developing brittle bones.The Philippine College of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism also indicated that the 2003 National Nutrition Health Survey found that osteoporosis affected 0.8 percent of Filipinos aged 60 to 69 and 2.5 percent of those over 70. THE data further revealed that women have a higher incidence of fractures (11.3 percent) compared to 9.0 percent among men.To lower this trend, the science and technology agency encouraged Filipinos to eat more calcium-rich foods such as fish, shellfish, cereals, green leafy vegetables, and dairy products. They also recommended getting morning sun exposure from 7 am to 9 am to activate vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium, as well as adding physical activity to daily routine, even something as simple as walking, dancing, or playing sports.“Through the addition of sufficient calcium-rich food into our diet and maintaining a balanced lifestyle, we can reduce the risk of Osteoporosis and make every Filipino enjoy strong bones, leading to a healthier and more productive life,” the DOST chief said.World Osteoporosis Day was first celebrated on October 20, 1996, initiated by the United Kingdom’s National Osteoporosis Society. The campaign was adopted by the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) the following year, which has led worldwide efforts ever since to raise awareness about bone health.This year’s theme is “Say No to Fragile Bones.”"

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/21/healthy-bones-healthy-life-dost-marks-world-osteoporosis-day-with-call-to-action/,"Healthy bones, healthy life: DOST marks World Osteoporosis Day with call to action","IN observance of World Osteoporosis Day on October 20, 2024, the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) calls attention to the need for Filipinos to prioritize bone health. Osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones and increases the likelihood of fractures, remains a concern that many are unaware of. One of the most effective ways to help prevent it is through adequate calcium intake. Calcium is an essential nutrient for maintaining bone strength. However, many Filipinos do not meet the recommended levels of calcium in their diet, increasing the risk of developing brittle bones. According to the 2021 Expanded National Nutrition Survey (ENNS) conducted by DOST-Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI), 9 out of 10 Filipino adults and the elderly have inadequate calcium intake.At DOST, we are committed to raising awareness about the importance of bone health and proper nutrition. Through our research-backed nutrition and food safety initiatives, we are working to improve and promote access to supplemental nutrients like calcium-rich food in everyday meals. To promote better bone health, it is important to eat fish, shellfish, cereals, green leafy vegetables, and dairy products that are recommended for healthy bones, teeth, hair, and nails. Vitamin D also helps the body absorb adequate amounts of calcium from the diet. Exposure to the morning sun, ideally from 7 to 9 a.m., activates vitamin D in the body. Additionally, we encourage everybody to engage in physical exercise. Simple activities such as walking, dancing, or participating in sports can strengthen bones and improve overall fitness. Adopting a habit that includes proper nutrition with an active lifestyle will enable everybody to maintain strong bones and enjoy physical well-being.We urge the Filipino nation to take proactive steps in advocating bone health. Through the addition of sufficient calcium-rich food into our diet and maintaining a balanced lifestyle, we can reduce the risk of Osteoporosis and make every Filipino enjoy strong bones, leading to a healthier and more productive life.Image credits:"

The major shift is one of the most noteworthy findings of the recently-concluded survey titled “2024 Market Study: Feeling the Insurance Pulse of Pinoy Gen Y and Z” conducted by health insurance provider PhilLife.Generation Y, or Millennials, are those born between 1981 and 1996 while Generation Z, or Zoomers, are those born between 1997 and 2012.According to the study, 78 percent of millennial respondents and 77 percent of zoomers chose protecting families and preparing for emergencies as the benefits they consider the most important in insurance plans.The PhilLife study also found that for the next three years, 76 percent of the respondents want their insurance to prepare them for accidents and 67 percent for loss of life. Furthermore, 66 percent want an insurance benefit that will ensure their family’s standard of living and 64 percent want one that will ensure personal financial stability.“Based on a qualitative study released a decade ago, we learned that investment growth was the top consideration when choosing an insurance. However, in this post-pandemic survey, the main considerations among the public are quite different,” PhilLife market study lead researcher Dr. Fernando Paragas said.“The changed priorities are perhaps due to our pandemic realizations wherein preparing for health emergencies and protecting the family trump the pursuit of financial gains per se.”PhilLife President and CEO Jaeger L. Tanco pointed out that the PhilLife Market Study was inspired by the PhilCare Wellness Index, an innovative nationwide study that began in 2014 and aims to understand the values and mindset of Filipinos on health and wellness. “Just like the Wellness Index, the PhilLife Market Study has allowed us to gather relevant and reliable data on a particular demographic so we can make informed decisions on how to better meet their needs,” Tanco said.“The research confirms that health emergency preparedness and family security are non-negotiable priorities for Millennials and Gen Zs. Understanding these priorities is essential to designing products that align with their values,” he added. Tanco said the results of the PhilLife Market Study has allowed the company to develop insurance solutions with the two generations in mind. These solutions include lifetime and term-life protection coverage, health assistance plan, and an investment plan with guaranteed returns. “Armed with the study’s findings, we will ensure the comprehensive protection of the younger generation with adaptable plans,” Tanco added. Tanco also serves as the President and CEO of PhilCare. He was recently honored with the prestigious Circle of Excellence CEO of the Year award at the 2024 Asia CEO Award.Rizal Raoul S.

Especially among lower-income households, operations to treat cleft conditions are perceived to be expensive thus preventing them from seeking treatment.Recent studies have indicated that globally, 1 in 700 babies are born with a cleft lip and palate; and many do not know that cleft conditions are more than just treatable. That is why coming from National Cleft Awareness & Prevention Month, Listerine together with Operation Smile Philippines and Watsons launched the #GiftASmile campaign last September 4 to inspire Filipinos to make a difference and gift a smile to a child with cleft lip and palate.Hosted by none other than Mikee Reyes, Listerine brand ambassador, the event aims to raise awareness about cleft lip and palate, and more importantly, to educate cleft patients and their families on the importance of good oral hygiene. Together with Operation Smile Philippines and Watsons, the goal of the campaign is to increase support needed for the program through volunteers, referrals, and donations.As a longtime partner of Operation Smile Philippines, Listerine stresses the importance of oral health for children with cleft lip and palate, who are more susceptible to tooth decay due to increased exposure to germs and bacteria, making them more prone to oral diseases and infections. Miggy Gamboa, marketing manager for Listerine Philippines, emphasized “Listerine believes that healthy smiles are meant for all. As a mouthwash brand, Listerine advocates proper oral hygiene, especially for kids with cleft, so we can protect them from oral problems as early as possible to prevent further issues. Join us in educating the families of kids with cleft and teach them how to protect their mouths with proper oral health.”“In the Philippines, there is an estimated 200,000 backlog of children with cleft lip and palate and many live in remote or rural communities. That’s why we urge the public to refer any patient to Operation Smile Philippines because I believe that each of us can make a difference by helping to transform a life of a child, one smile at the time!’ said Operation Smile Philippines’ executive director Emiliano Romano.Sharon Decapia, SAVP for Marketing, PR, and Sustainability of Watsons Philippines, also a longstanding partner of Listerine, highlighted, “As part of our mission to , we continue to team up with Operation Smile Philippines to bring perfect smiles to children afflicted with cleft lip and palate through the #GiftASmile campaign. We are proud to have Listerine as a loyal partner since 2013 in transforming the lives of these children.”To shed light on her story as a mother of a child with cleft, Anne Clutz shared heartfelt insights from her journey, “Providing free comprehensive cleft surgeries to kids with cleft, is so valuable, especially for less fortunate families. I just want to thank Operation Smile Philippines and Listerine for making life-changing surgeries accessible and promoting the importance of good oral hygiene.”Giving more kids the chance to live with healthier smiles is the main goal of #GiftASmile. Listerine’s commitment to promoting oral health, combined with Operation Smile Philippines’ free comprehensive cleft care—including dental services, nutrition screening, and speech therapy—and Watsons’ advocacy in bringing healthy smiles, is what these children need for their confidence to thrive. To support Operation Smile Philippines’ efforts in providing speech therapy, Listerine will donate ₱10 to Operations Smile Philippines for every bottle sold* for speech therapy *for the first 50,000 bottles sold of any Listerine variant and size from Sept 22, 2024, until Dec 31, 2024.

She noted that when someone is unhappy, it’s essential to recognize what burdens them and learn to let go of those negative influences.“Mamimili tayo ng laban sa buhay. Parang ‘yung mga masyadong mabigat, alamin natin kung kailan sila dapat bitawan at alamin natin kung ano ‘yung dapat nating pinanghahawakan para gumigising tayo nang masaya kasi nakikita ‘yun sa mukha natin,” she said.On September 26, 2024, Garcia was unveiled as the new ambassador for Bioessence, a well-established local beauty and wellness clinic, which also celebrated its 30th anniversary in the industry.According to Garcia, it’s exciting to be part of a brand that she genuinely believes in. The actress also shared that before she became the brand’s ambassador, her mother had already been associated with it.“They are with me in all of my wins,” she said, recalling how she first endorsed the brand when she was around 17 or 18 years old and had her first major role as a lead actress in the GMA show “Adik Sayo” alongside Dennis Trillo.She also mentioned that even during her eight-year hiatus from acting, the brand remained by her side, expressing her gratitude for the brand’s recognition of her milestones and vice versa.Garcia shared that she has a movie and a soap opera (teleserye) in the pipeline, though she did not disclose any details. However, as the newest brand ambassador for the beauty line, she encouraged her fans to continue their support, emphasizing that she would not endorse a product or service if she didn’t genuinely believe in it.Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/17/celebrating-all-forms-of-beauty-bela-padilla-adds-perfume-line-to-products-promoting-inclusivity/,CELEBRATING ALL FORMS OF BEAUTY | Bela Padilla adds perfume line to products promoting inclusivity,"Actress and TV host Bela Padilla does not agree with what she considers a “one-dimensional standard of beauty” in the Philippines.“People used to say, ‘She’s not that pretty, she’s just fair-skinned,’” Bela pointed out during the recent launch of Dani by Bela, the debut fragrance collection of her very own Bela by Bela imprint.Bela hopes to improve how people, Filipinos in particular, perceive what is considered “the standard of beauty.” Bela hopes that people’s concepts of beauty evolve as they mature and learn to accept different people and ideas. “We want to celebrate all forms of beauty so with the Bela by Bela campaign, we feature people of various ages, skin textures, and colors,” she said.Underscoring inclusivity, Bela’s cosmetic product line is formulated to magnify one’s natural beauty, not conceal it. For instance, her cream-based Dot Perfection cheek tint adjusts to any skin tone and only needs a small dot to achieve what she describes as “a natural, healthy glow.”“We don’t want to cover up your natural look. We just want to make you feel a bit better.”Among those who share Bela’s vision is Dani Barretto, who she revealed has been her best friend for 15 years. Dani by Bela, the perfume line for Bela by Bela is a collaboration by the two artists.“This collaboration took years to develop. Having her lend her name to us is a significant deal as it is always a risk when you put your name on something. Dani is very meticulous and conscious about what she puts out,” Bela pointed out.Bela recalled that she and Dani considered several ventures and then opted for a new perfume line as it came with a more personal significance. For Bela, fragrance is a form of personal expression and she and Dani made sure that that kind of sensibility is embodied in Dani by Bela.At the launch event at Il Terrazo last October 12, Bela also introduced her business partners, DL WEaR Private CO. owner and operations manager Lan Ros Tañedo, and president and CEO Dennis Valbuena. Bela, who is also known for her entrepreneurial spirit, said that it is important to “always believe in doing what you love” including and especially in business.“When you’re passionate about something, answering any questions about it becomes a lot easier because you know and love what you’re doing,” Bela noted.As one of the busiest celebrities, balancing acting and entrepreneurship, Bela reflected on how she manages her time: “There’s no such thing as a day off. Time is just a concept for me now. Still, I don’t mind it because I enjoy what I do, and when you enjoy what you do, you can always find time for the things you love doing.”But whether she’s acting, hosting or attending to her business endeavors, which also include the upscale casual dining restaurant, Tipsy Pig, Bela does not intend to rest on her laurels, so to speak.“I have many responsibilities so I need to keep working. It’s not just myself that I have to consider. Owning my own dream house is what I’m aiming for,” the actress further shared.Like most successful entrepreneurs, Bela’s priorities also include her own brand of corporate social responsibility (CSR) or giving back to the community.She’s particularly concerned about Bohol as one of the provinces she intends to provide some significant assistance. “I’ve been visiting Bohol a lot lately. I want to see how we can help with preserving and conserving the wildlife there,” she declared.Bela noted that while city folks like her live daily lives as if everything’s okay, “bigger problems are happening elsewhere.”“And that’s what I want to focus on next,” Bela concluded."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/17/doh-marks-breast-cancer-awareness-month-with-nationwide-campaign/,DOH marks breast cancer awareness month with nationwide campaign,"Breast cancer incidence in the Philippines, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is reported to be at 33,079 in 2022, among the highest in Asia.The Department of Health (DOH) said that their advocacy for breast cancer awareness goes beyond information campaigns as it also includes expanding access to critical screening services. Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said that the DOH has rolled out free breast cancer screening through accredited providers. Under the PhilHealth (Philippine Health Insurance Corporation) Konsulta Package, clinical breast examinations are offered, while Cancer Assistance Fund Access Sites provide mammography and breast ultrasound services, ensuring early detection and timely intervention for those Filipinos at risk. The DOH, led by Herbosa, recently joined the Philippine College of Surgeons (PCS) and Inner Wheel Club of the Philippines (IWCP) in launching a nationwide cancer awareness activity, focused on raising awareness about breast cancer.Herbosa led the day’s culmination of activities on October 11, 2024, through a nationwide lighting of 137 iconic landmarks, all illuminated in pink (the international color for breast cancer awareness) to symbolize unity in the fight against cancer.Among these landmarks were the Quezon Memorial Shrine, Manila Hotel, Cagsawa Ruins in Albay, Fernan Bridge in Cebu, and the Grand Mosque in Cotabato City. Numerous hospitals, capitol buildings, and other prominent structures also participated, amplifying the message of hope and collective action in the fight against cancer.During the event, Herbosa highlighted his unwavering commitment to improve cancer care in the country as part of the Health Sector’s 8-Point Action Agenda. He also mentioned that among the recent milestones of the DOH in this battle is the inauguration of the East Avenue Medical Center (EAMC) Cancer Center, a state-of-the-art facility offering advanced services such as radiation oncology, nuclear medicine, chemotherapy, and a dedicated breast center.This facility, which opened on October 8, 2024, is set to become the country’s apex referral center for breast cancer by 2028. “I am deeply moved by the overwhelming support from various sectors in our fight against cancer, particularly breast cancer. This collective effort, represented by all of you, is a true testament to our shared commitment to ensuring that every Filipino, regardless of their background or circumstance, has access to the quality healthcare they deserve,” said Herbosa.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/17/the-hidden-danger-on-our-plates-why-food-warning-labels-matter-now-more-than-ever/,The hidden danger on our plates: Why food warning labels matter now more than ever,"There is a silent killer lurking in our country today, and it’s found in the very choices we make at the dining table—choices that too often, we’re not even aware of. This is far from a judgment of our eating habits; this is but an invitation to ask yourself this: do you really know what’s in the food you’re buying for your family? We are a nation of food lovers, with rich culinary traditions that bind us together. In a country where the culture of food is at the heart of every gathering, it is painful to admit that many of these choices are contributing to a growing health crisis: obesity and noncommunicable diseases that may develop from childhood until later in adult life. As recently as last year, heart diseases were still found to be the leading cause of death in the Philippines. The same children we expect to thrive and carry the future of this country are now at risk of life-threatening diseases because of the food they consume. At the heart of this crisis is our broken food system. Many of us like to believe that the choices we make are our own. However, the reality is that our decisions about what to eat are often the result of forces beyond our control. It’s a story I’ve seen time and time again in my practice. Filipino families, so focused on work and studies, wonder why they get sick or can’t lose weight. “Healthy” naman daw ang kinakain namin, they say, but the truth is, it’s not just about individual choices. The environment we live in, including the lack of clear, understandable labeling, play a pivotal role in our health outcomes. The reality is this: our own dining tables, lovingly stocked and prepared by the hands of hardworking Filipino parents, are packed with highly processed, unhealthy products. This is because the food industry is simply not looking out for our best interests. Snacks and drinks, the prepackaged and processed food that claim to be healthy are fooling Filipino consumers when they are loaded with sodium, saturated fats, and sugar. These ingredients are masked by clever marketing and vague labeling, making it nearly impossible for the average consumer to make informed decisions. This insidious marketing is by design, but a clear solution has been staring us in the face for years now. Mandatory front-of-pack food warning labels ensuring clear and prominent information will allow consumers to quickly see when a product contains unhealthy levels of sugar, fat, or sodium. It’s a simple, powerful tool to help us all make healthier choices. Today, this basic right to know is being denied in the name of profit, and the industry as a whole is going to lengths to make sure we don’t know what’s in their products. We cannot allow big business to continue profiting at the expense of our children’s health. Food labeling is not just about awareness—it’s about public health. Many countries around the world have already adopted such policies, and it’s time for the Philippines to do the same. This is a matter of public health, consumer rights, and public policy. The choices we make today will determine the health of future generations. We cannot afford to let our food—and by extension, our health—become another area where we lag behind the rest of the world.A mandatory front-of-pack food warning label policy will benefit all Filipinos—parents, children, workers, you, and me. It will empower us to make informed choices about what we put in our bodies and protect the most vulnerable among us from the long-term effects of unhealthy diets. Dapat alam namin kung ano ang mga nasa pagkain ng mga anak namin. Bilang mga magulang, protektahan natin ang mga pamilya natin. As we commemorate International World Food Day, this is the call I extend to us all: Let’s shift the focus from blaming individual choices to examining the broader factors that influence our food choices. Let’s examine the information available to us—starting at the dining table. If we are serious about protecting public health, then it is about time we give consumers the information they deserve and warn against the products that only damage us further. Public health should empower people, not place the burden on them. There will be a mass media campaign organized by the Healthy Philippines Alliance and HealthJustice Philippines to raise awareness on the importance of front-of-pack food warning labels aimed at empowering Filipino consumers to make the right choices for themselves and their families. This will be part of a larger call for stronger policies to combat the country’s growing health crises of obesity and noncommunicable diseases. Join our call for a food warning label policy and learn more via the Healthy Philippines Alliance Facebook page and website. Dr. Jaime Galvez Tan has served in various capacities, including as Secretary of Health and as a East Asia and Pacific UNICEF Regional Adviser on Health and Nutrition.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/17/nutrition-professionals-fb-sector-partner-to-address-countrys-nutrition-issues/,"Nutrition professionals, F&B sector partner to address country’s nutrition issues","Good nutrition. Physical activity. These are the elements that medical experts believe are vital to living healthy and maintaining a healthy weight. But there are those who think that good nutrition is not just about weight but the many health benefits it brings to people.Some of these benefits include reduced risks to many diseases, many of them non-communicable diseases (NCD) kind like diabetes, stroke, heart disease, some cancers. There is also the benefit of stable blood pressure, protection against certain ailments, improved well-being, heightened energy levels, and the like.With the fast-paced lifestyle many are living nowadays however, people often neglect or overlook the value of nutrition by opting to consume high-calorie food types that are not only highly processed but sorely lacking in nutritional quality. This compared to home-cooked meals prepared traditionally and precisely to make sure that the body gets all the nutrients, vitamins and minerals it needs to stay healthy.Coupled with having a sedentary lifestyle, becoming overweight or obese is a situation that’s bound to happen. There are contributing factors to it such as malnutrition or undernutrition, poor diets, and even failing food systems. Just because one is eating does not necessarily mean one is healthy.BASED on data provided by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI), one of the research and development institutes of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), “stunting, or the failure of people to reach their full growth potential, has dropped since 2015 among all children, from newborns to adolescents, with the largest gains, from 31.2 percent in 2015 to 19.7 percent in 2021, among children five to 10 years old.”When it comes to the percentage of pregnant women nutritionally at risk, “this has dropped significantly, from 24.7 percent in 2015 to 16 percent in 2021. On the other hand, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has risen in recent years, especially among older adults.”There is also the new Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition (PPAN) 2023-2028, which has laid out plans to improve nutrition in the country to 2028, which “demonstrates the country’s commitment to making nutrition a key driver and indicator of development.”The plan seeks to “reduce all forms of malnutrition across all life stages, includes interventions that focus on healthier diets, better practices and improved access to quality services. Changes from the previous action plan include the adoption of a life stage approach, strong emphasis on food security and obesity, a results framework based on a theory of change, and recognition of the importance of improving nutrition behaviors.”IT will take time to address nutrition and health challenges in order to realize marked improvement but there is light at the end of the dark tunnel, as they say.In a recent development, key leaders from the nutrition community and the food and beverage industry, have joined hands and expressed their “solid commitment to establish transformative partnerships and taking a pivotal step toward improving nutrition outcomes in the Philippines.”According to Cristina Sison, President of the Philippine Stakeholders for Nutrition and Dietetics, Inc. (PSND), Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) with the food and beverage sector are “crucial in addressing the nation’s growing nutrition and health challenges.” She highlighted the industry’s vital role in food fortification programs, affordable nutrition and emergency food provision for Filipinos.She said that with the food and beverage industry partnering with the nutrition community, it can transform the country’s nutrition landscape. “PPPs offer a unique opportunity to amplify existing nutrition efforts by replicating successful models tailored for the Philippines.”Further, Sison emphasized that these partnerships could enhance food fortification, reduce health inequities, combat hunger, and improve food security for all. In a PSND white paper titled “Public-Private Partnership with Food and Beverage Industry for Healthier Filipinos,” it advocated for the establishment of more substantive and transformational partnerships. “The food and beverage industry can leverage the expertise of professional organizations in nutrition and health, while the latter can offer their strength and knowledge on promoting healthy diets and engage with broader audiences.”FOR his part, Dr. Mario Capanzana, Executive Director of the Philippine Chamber of Food Manufacturers, Inc. (PCFMI), also stressed the food and beverage industry’s shared vision with the PSND to drive meaningful progress toward improved nutrition outcomes for Filipino communities.Dr. Capanzana outlined key initiatives, including legislative and regulatory support, consumer education programs, innovation and product renovation, and ensuring a safe and sustainable food supply.“We at the PCFMI are committed to collaboration and welcome discussions on product reformulation to enhance nutrition interventions through food fortification. We are also eager to explore new technologies that can improve the nutritional content of our products,” Dr. Capanzana pointed out.He likewise underscored the immense potential for collaboration within the industry, saying that “leveraging industry expertise can significantly advance nutrition research, as well as utilizing distribution networks for a wider reach of nutrition programs.”This early, snacks maker Mondelēz International, is aligned with the white paper’s goal of creating a holistic and collaborative approach to nutrition in the Philippines. As part of its advocacy, the company fortifies its products such as Tang, Eden Cheese, and Tiger biscuits, among others, to offer affordable nutrition. The company also promotes Mindful Snacking, which means eating with attention and intention, in order to help consumers avoid overindulging. These efforts reflect Mondelēz’s purpose to empower people to “snack right.”"

Go that it will include optometric services in its list of coverage by end of November this year.The World Report on Vision in 2019 revealed that half of the world population will be myopic or near-sighted by the year 2050.A 2018 Philippine Eye Disease Study highlighted that vision impairment and blindness have a prevalence rate of 1.98 percent, which represents 1.11 million Filipinos with cataract, about 400,000 with uncorrected error of refraction, almost 300,000 with glaucoma, and around 200,000 with maculopathy/diabetic retinopathy (DR).“Preventive eye care and the inclusion of optometric services and prescription eyeglasses coverage by Philhealth is important to enable early detection of eye and vision problems in children,” Dr. Charlie L. Ho, Integrated Philippine Association of Optometrists (IPAO) Chairman, said during the joint committee meeting.He added, “Many eye issues and even blindness are preventable with early intervention, but many Filipinos lack access to primary eye care from optometrists.”Senator Go also encouraged PhilHealth to support vision care services, especially for children to improve learning and academic performance and prevent complications of high myopia like early cataract, retinal detachment and myopia macular degeneration (MMD), a blinding disease.Atty.

Santos, Philhealth Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer reiterated their commitment to cover optometric services by November 30, 2024 as it is consistent with the purpose of The Universal Health Care Law.“We would like to commend and thank Senator Go for championing the cause of the optometrists and the Philhealth leadership led by President and CEO Emmanuel “Mandy” R. Ledesma, Jr. and Atty. Eli Dino Santos for their swift action to address and include the eye care needs of Filipino people,” said Dr. Ho adding that IPAO expressed gratitude to Agri Partylist Rep. Wilbert T. Lee for his tireless effort to include Philhealth coverage of optometric services, which will benefit millions of Filipinos especially the poor.The hearing was also attended by Dr. John Nakpil, IPAO President, Dr. Mildred Pre, Chairman of Philippine Society of Public Health and Occupational Optometry (PSPHOO), Hon. Christine Rodriguez and Hon. Fides Masanga of the Board of Optometry."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/11/hepatitis-a-remains-a-hidden-danger-in-local-shellfish-industry-scientists/,Hepatitis A remains a ‘hidden danger’ in local shellfish industry — scientists,"Scientists are raising the alarm about Hepatitis A virus (HAV) in Philippine shellfish, warning that it is largely unmonitored and urging better safety measures to prevent viral contamination.A study by experts from Ateneo de Manila University, the University of the Philippines, and Monash University Malaysia found that most Filipinos are unaware of HAV risks, despite the virus being able to survive in shellfish for up to 10 weeks. Contaminated water, especially near industrial and residential areas, is a major source of infection, with raw or improperly cooked shellfish posing a significant health risk.HAV, which can be transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food and water, especially raw or undercooked shellfish, can survive from eight to 10 weeks in shellfish, increasing the risk of transmission. Shellfish, especially those farmed in shallow coastal areas near industrial and residential zones, are highly susceptible to contamination.“Although the wider Philippine public is aware of the dangers from other food safety concerns such as “red tide,” there is little public awareness of the dangers from HAV and other viruses,” the research team stated in their press release.Currently, shellfish safety tests in the country focus on bacterial indicators, with no established protocols to detect HAV. This gap, researchers said, leaves room for undetected outbreaks and exposes consumers to potential infection.Based on the Food and Nutrition Research Institute’s data, the average daily per capita consumption of crustaceans and mollusks is approximately 9 grams, with mussels contributing about 1 gram per day. However, other specific sub-groups for oysters were not mentioned in the national consumption survey.The team also noted the absence of studies on how traditional cooking methods impact the survivability of HAV. They called for comprehensive research into the “farm-to-fork” supply chain to better understand how the virus could spread through local communities.“On one end of the chain, farms are often located in shallow coastal areas near industrial and residential zones where there is a high potential for contamination. At the other end, much is also unknown about how traditional preparation and cooking practices such as steaming or boiling affect the survivability of HAV,” they added.The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the Department of Health have been urged to include viral testing in their safety protocols. “Government program should also not be limited in the harvest and post-harvest aspect of the shellfish value chain, i.e. additional studies should be conducted to determine the effect of different food process, cooking practices, and storage conditions to the HAV concentration,” they said.The study, funded by the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD), was published in the Philippine Journal of Science. ###"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/10/nobel-prize-in-chemistry-honors-3-scientists-who-used-ai-to-design-proteins-lifes-building-blocks/,Nobel Prize in chemistry honors 3 scientists who used AI to design proteins — life’s building blocks,"Three scientists who discovered powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins — the building blocks of life — were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry Wednesday. Their work used advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs and other materials are made.The prize was awarded to David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, computer scientists at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London.Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said the award honored research that unraveled “a grand challenge in chemistry, and in particular in biochemistry, for decades.”“It’s that breakthrough that gets awarded today,” he said.Proteins are complex molecules with thousands of atoms that twist, turn, loop and spiral in a countless array of shapes that determine their biological function. For decades, scientists have dreamed of being able to efficiently design and build new proteins.Baker, 62, whose work has received funding from the National Institutes of Health since the 1990s, created a computer program called Rosetta that helped analyze information about existing proteins in comprehensive databases to build new proteins that don’t exist in nature.“It seems that you can almost construct any type of protein now with this technology,” said Johan Åqvist of the Nobel committee.Hassabis, 48, and Jumper, 39, created an artificial intelligence model that has predicted the structure of virtually all the 200 million proteins that researchers have ever identified.The duo “managed to crack the code. With skillful use of artificial intelligence, they made it possible to predict the complex structure of essentially any known protein in nature,” Linke said.The ability to custom design new proteins — and better understand existing proteins — could enable researchers to create new kinds of medicines and vaccines.It could also allow scientists to design new enzymes to break down plastics or other waste materials that would neutralize pollution, Baker told a news conference, or even come up with entirely new material for semi conductors.“I think there’s fantastic prospects for making better medicines — medicines that are smarter, that only work in the right time and place in the body,” Baker told The Associated Press.One example is a potential nasal spray that could slow or stop the rapid spread of specific viruses, such as COVID-19, he said. Another is a medicine to disrupt the cascade of symptoms known as cytokine storm.“That was always the holy grail. If you could figure out how protein sequences folded into their particular structures, then it might be possible to design protein sequences to fold into previously never seen structures that might be useful for us,” said Jon Lorsch, a director at the NIH.Baker told the AP he found out he won the Nobel during the early hours of the morning alongside his wife, who immediately started screaming.“So it was a little deafening, too,” he said.Hassabis said he was just having a “normal morning” at home when he eventually got the call.The Nobel committee didn’t initially have his number and first managed to get hold of his wife, but she hung up on them a few times, he told an online news briefing.“They kept persisting and then I think she realized it was a Swedish number and then they asked for my number,” he said.“It’s so incredible. It’s so unreal at this moment,” said Jumper, a researcher and director at Google DeepMind. “And it’s wonderful.”One of Britain’s leading tech figures, Hassabis co-founded the AI research lab DeepMind in 2010, which was acquired by Google in 2014. Among its past breakthroughs was developing an AI system that mastered the Chinese game Go and defeated the game’s human world champion.In the past researchers labored for months or years to decode the structure of a single complex protein.But the AI model created by the DeepMind researchers, called AlphaFold, “can determine the structure of a protein pretty accurately within a few seconds or minutes,” Hassabis told the AP in an interview, adding that this saves researchers “years of potentially painstaking experimental work.”The two research groups learned from each other’s work.Baker said Hassabis and Jumper’s artificial intelligence work gave his team a huge boost.“The breakthroughs made by Demis and John on protein structure prediction really highlighted to us the power that AI could have,” said Baker. “And that led us to apply these AI methods to protein design.”Science has sped up, said Jumper. “It is a key demonstration that AI will make science faster “It’s the second Nobel prize this year awarded to someone with links to artificial intelligence research at Google.Nobel physics prize winner Geoffrey Hinton, 76, often called the “godfather of AI,” also worked at the California-based tech company until quitting so he could speak more openly about the potential downsides of AI.“I’m hoping AI will lead to tremendous benefits,” Hinton told a news conference Tuesday. “I’m convinced that it will do that in health care.”“My worry is that it may also lead to bad things. And in particular, when we get things more intelligent than ourselves, no one really knows whether we’re going to be able to control them.”Wednesday’s chemistry prize winners represent a younger generation taking forward the work of the AI pioneers honored for physics, said Michael Kearns, a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.They are making AI models “scalable and practical and applying it to very important scientific problems.”Baker gets half of the 11 million Swedish Kronor ($1 million) prize money, while Hassabis and Jumper share the other half.The Nobel announcements opened Monday with medical researchers Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize. Hinton and fellow AI pioneer John Hopfield, 91, won the physics prize.The awards continue with the literature prize Thursday, the Nobel Peace Prize Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14.The prize money comes from a bequest by the award’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/10/icanserve-foundation-hosts-breast-cancer-survivorship-and-supportive-care-workshop/,ICanServe Foundation hosts breast cancer survivorship and supportive care workshop,"Cancer impacts millions of people globally, affecting both adults and children. The journey of survivorship begins at diagnosis and extends throughout life, encompassing both those living with cancer and those in remission. Beyond the patient, cancer also impacts their loved ones, who are also considered survivors.The Philippines-based advocacy group of breast cancer survivors and volunteers, ICanServe Foundation (ICS), recently held a transformative workshop aimed to equip leaders of breast cancer patient groups and the City Health Office partners of ICanServe, with knowledge and skills to improve survivorship and supportive care across the country.Titled “Leading With Care: Building a Supportive Future for Breast CancerSurvivors,” the two-day event was held at SEDA Hotel, BGC, on October 4 and 5, 2024. This was the fourth time that ICS convened Patient Power Philippines, an informal coalition of breast cancer support groups, as it aims to bring together healthcare professionals, patient advocates, and the government to discuss crucial yet often overlooked topics such as survivorship and supportive care for breast cancer patients.Dr. Don Dizon, a medical oncologist specializing in women’s cancers, delivered a virtual presentation at the event and answered questions from the audience. He is the director of women’s cancers at the Lifespan Cancer Institute and director of medical oncology at Rhode Island Hospital in the United States. His research focuses on innovative treatments and the challenges of survivorship.“It’s important to know that the definition that is most relevant for people who have been diagnosed with cancer, survivorship begins at the point of the initial diagnosis. That is where I consider the journey with cancer to start,” said Dr. Dizon.“There may be periods where people on those treatments are cancer-free, but that also includes this dynamic state of survivorship. So the inclusion of people within the survivorship realm who have just been diagnosed, who have just received curative treatment, who have relapsed, who have continued on treatment for metastatic disease, all of that is really important because the needs persist and are not limited to solely those who have been cured of their cancers,” he added.Dr. Dizon discussed the four components of survivorship care which include detection and surveillance of recurrent cancers, new cancers, and late effects of cancer and its treatment; intervention for the long-term and late effects of cancer and its treatment; prevention of recurrent and new cancers and other late effects, and coordination between providers to ensure that all survivors’ health needs are met.He explained that late and long-term effects of cancer and its treatment can include accelerated bone loss or osteoporosis, persistent cancer-related fatigue, and brain fog or cognitive difficulties that prevent some from returning to their job.“There are these late effects that people will need help with far beyond that cancer diagnosis. What can we do to keep people healthy so that they not only survive this cancer, but also survive preventable illnesses like heart disease? And then it’s care coordination,” said Dr. Dizon.He emphasized that care coordination is critical because in the past, some people who have been diagnosed with cancers “tended to fall in the cracks.” They were not getting, for example, screening for secondary cancers. If someone had breast cancer, it was very unlikely she would be referred for a colonoscopy to prevent colon cancer. Some were also less likely to get the flu shot because no one took ownership of that care.“This tenet indicates that your oncologist needs to talk to a primary care doctor to ensure that services are delivered to people even after they’ve been diagnosed with cancer,” added Dr. Dizon.The survivorship term likewise embraces what is called a new normal.“Life after a cancer diagnosis is forever changed. It doesn’t mean it’s worse, but it is different. That process does not happen overnight. It actually takes time. The new normal is something that reveals itself to you over time. And I don’t think we prepare people enough for that, especially if one has a relapse or develops metastatic disease,” said Dr. Dizon.In this new reality, it is crucial to recognize the psychological trauma often experienced by those receiving curative treatment. The end of treatment can be a time of profound reflection and processing. Many people who complete curative therapy may still struggle to understand their diagnosis, the stage of their cancer, the treatment they received, and what the future holds.A session on mental health was also held featuring Alya Honasan, a writer, editor, and breast cancer survivor, together with Lia Delgado-Infante, a licensed psychologist from InTouch Community Services who offered guidance on effective self-care strategies, particularly for families navigating the emotional challenges of cancer.“Mental health is a crucial aspect of the breast cancer journey. Support and coping strategies can significantly improve quality of life,” said Delgado-Infante.Day 2 of the event discussed Hospice and Palliative Care, Exercise as Medicine, Global Breast Cancer Initiative, and “How to institutionalize multidisciplinary survivorship and supportive care in both the public and private sectors.”The event was organized by ICS in partnership with AstraZeneca, Bio-ONCO, Roche, Novartis, MSD, Healthway Cancer Care Hospital, NutriAsia and the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines (PHAP)."

Marcos, Jr. na palakasin ang sistema ng kalusugan sa bansa.Layunin ng programang ito na matiyak na ang bawat Pilipino, anuman ang estado sa buhay, ay makakakuha ng kinakailangang serbisyong medikal nang hindi iniisip ang malaking gastusin. “Ito ang mensahe ng PhilHealth sa ating mga kababayan, huwag po kayong matakot sa gastos sa pagkakasakit, sagot kayo ng PhilHealth!” pahayag ni Emmanuel Ledesma, Jr., Pangulo ng PhilHealth.Ayon kay Ledesma, nakatuon ang PhilHealth sa pagpapalawak ng coverage para sa mga pangunahing sakit sa Pilipinas, gaya ng pneumonia, malalang dengue, stroke, sakit sa bato, at iba’t ibang uri ng kanser. Sa ngayon, 60% ng mga kondisyong ito ay sakop na ng mas pinalawak na benepisyo. Kabilang dito ang mas mataas na case rates para sa pneumonia, hika, stroke, neonatal sepsis, at chronic kidney disease na nangangailangan ng hemodialysis. Sa taong 2025, palalawakin pa ang tulong para sa mga pasyenteng may lung, liver, ovary and prostate cancer, lalo na ang mga sumasailalim sa chemotherapy.Bilang bahagi ng Universal Health Care (UHC) program, inaasahang tataas din ang tulong pinansiyal sa iba pang malulubhang sakit. Layunin nito na maiwasang bumagsak sa kahirapan ang mga pamilya dahil sa malalaking gastusing medikal.Ipinagmamalaki rin ng PhilHealth na ang Pilipinas ang kauna-unahang bansa sa Asia-Pacific na naglunsad ng isang outpatient therapeutic care package para sa Severe Acute Malnutrition noong Oktubre 1. Layunin ng benepisyong ito na labanan ang malnutrisyon sa mga bata at bawasan ang pasaning pinansyal ng mga pamilyang apektado nito.Bilang karagdagan, inalis na rin ang patakaran sa Single Period of Confinement (SPC) upang matulungan ang mga miyembrong nangangailangan ng tuloy-tuloy na gamutan. Tataas din ng 59% ang benepisyo para sa hemodialysis mula P4000 na magiging P6,350 sa darating na Nobyembre. Dahil dito ay aabot na sa halos Php 1 milyon kada taon ang benepisyo sa bawat apektadong pasyente.Kasabay ng pagpapalawak ng benepisyo, gumagamit din ang PhilHealth ng makabagong teknolohiya upang mapabuti ang kanilang mga serbisyo. Nakipagtulungan sila sa Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), Department of Health (DOH), at Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) upang mas mapadali ang proseso ng mga serbisyo ng PhilHealth, lalo na para sa mga nasa malalayong lugar.Pinalawak din ang programang “Konsulta” na nagbibigay ng libreng konsultasyon, diagnostic tests, at mga gamot batay sa rekomendasyon ng duktor upang matulungan ang mga Pilipino na mapanatiling malusog bago pa man magkasakit.Sa pagtatapos, nanawagan ang PhilHealth sa mga healthcare providers na makipagtulungan upang masiguro na madadama ng bawat Pilipino ang pinalawak na benepisyo ng PhilHealth sa pamamagitan ng pagbaba ng kanilang bayarin pang- medikal. “Sama-sama nating itaguyod ang isang mas malusog at matatag na Pilipinas” panawagan pa ni Ledesma."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/03/medical-community-backs-reinstatement-of-school-based-hpv-immunization-program/,Medical community backs reinstatement of school-based HPV immunization program,"Medical professionals and health advocates are rallying behind the reinstatement of the School-based Immunization Program (SBIP) targeting girls aged nine to 14 for HPV vaccination to combat cervical cancer.Cervical cancer remains a pressing public health issue in the Philippines, claiming 12 women’s lives daily. Health experts agree that this initiative is crucial to address this problem.The Department of Health (DOH) earlier announced that the nationwide school vaccination program for public schools will commence on October 7, 2024. Through the program, the DOH, in partnership with the Department of Education (DepEd) will be giving vaccines to students from Grades 1 to 7. These include vaccines for human papillomavirus (HPV), measles, rubella, tetanus and diphtheria. The HPV vaccines will be administered specifically to Grade 4 female students to prevent potential cervical cancer.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cervical cancer is highly preventable through vaccination against HPV, the leading cause of this disease.DOH and DepEd are working together to ensure that health education and vaccination efforts reach children where they are—at school. Dr. Carmina Vera, Medical Officer IV of the DOH, highlighted the importance of this partnership.“We aim to identify eligible populations to ensure equitable access for the most vulnerable groups in the country. By administering vaccines in schools, we can implement health education and collect parental consent more effectively,” said Dr. Vera.During the recent media forum titled “Isang Boses Laban sa Cervical Cancer” hosted by the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination (PFV), various medical societies have come together to emphasize the importance of HPV vaccination.Representatives from various medical groups presented their unified response and commitment to eliminate cervical cancer in the Philippines. Their statements highlighted a shared dedication to increase vaccination rates, improve screening programs, and provide accurate information about HPV and cervical cancer.“The Foundation supports the reinstatement of the School-Based Immunization Program to prevent cervical cancer and meet WHO’s 90 percent coverage target. We advocate for a coordinated national and local effort to prevent cervical cancer through vaccination, screening, and improved treatment access,” said Dr. Lulu Bravo, PFV Executive Director.Dr. Mildred Manalac-Mariano from the Philippine Medical Association (PMA) stated, “We support the promotion of the importance of vaccination against the human papillomavirus to prevent cervical cancer and decrease the cases.”Dr. Martha Millar-Aquino of the Philippine Infectious Disease Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (PIDSOG) pledged, “We are dedicated to implementing comprehensive strategies to tackle this disease head on. We pledge to increase the screening rates among women.”Dr. Kristine Bajandi, Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (PSMID) added, “Collaborative efforts among stakeholders are essential to ensuring access to cost-effective vaccines to protect future generations from vaccine-preventable diseases.”Dr. Deborah Red from the Society of Adolescent Medicine of the Philippines (SAMPI) and Philippine Society of Adolescent Medicine Specialists (PSAMS) affirmed, “We commit to provide accurate information on HPV vaccination to healthcare providers, adolescents, and parents.”Dr. Therese Mallen of the Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology Society of the Philippines (PAGSPHIL) highlighted the need for empowerment through education, stating, “We advocate for empowerment of adolescents through early comprehensive reproductive health education and awareness about cervical cancer and HPV.”Finally, Dr. Joan Millonado and Dr. Margaret Alfonso from the Philippine Ambulatory Pediatric Association (PAPA) expressed optimism about ongoing health literacy initiatives.“Through these initiatives, such as our continuing medical education activities, we are moving a few steps closer towards our goal of achieving cervical cancer elimination and promoting health across all populations,” said Dr. Millonado.During the forum, the importance of comprehensive education about HPV and cervical cancer was also discussed since many parents remain unaware of the critical role vaccination plays in preventing the disease.Dr. Orlaud Tantengco from the DEFEAT HPV study likewise shared his insights.“HPV viruses can be categorized into different types, much like a family tree. HPV 16 and 18 are among the more aggressive strains, classified as high-risk types because they are more likely to lead to cervical cancer. However, our study showed that HPV 52 was the most prevalent genotype,” said Dr. Tantengco.The DEFEAT HPV study aims to determine the molecular epidemiology and natural history of HPV infection among reproductive-age Filipino women using a community-based prospective cohort design.Dr. Ingrid Magnata, Jhpiego Country Program Manager, emphasized “the HPV vaccine has been available since 2006, and it was introduced in the public sector around 2014.” However, experts urged the government to aim for protection against a wider array of genotypes.“We support the use of a cost-effective HPV vaccine that targets the most number of prevalent and emerging types, and advocate for catch-up vaccinations for girls who missed previous doses,” Dr. Bravo added.The 9-valent HPV vaccine which offers broader protection against emerging high-risk HPV genotypes (including HPV types 31, 45, 52, and 58) has yet to be integrated into the national immunization program. The 9-valent vaccine, already available in private healthcare settings since 2017, is said to be a crucial component in the country’s cervical cancer prevention strategy.Dr. Vera explained that the process of procuring vaccines involves a lot of in-depth reviews and studies.“So as part of the process in the procurement of vaccines by the department, we only roll out, we procure vaccines which have regulatory clearance from our health technology assessment facility. And we also ensure that there is a proper pre-qualification to the database.”“Once the vaccine has received its regulatory clearance from our authorities, then we can conduct further studies and other situational analysis to incorporate the said vaccine. Also, we account for the cost of the vaccine. So again, if it takes a lot of review and studies,” said Dr. Vera."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/10/03/bridging-digital-divide-to-help-increase-family-planning-awareness-study/,Bridging digital divide to help increase family planning awareness–study,"As social media use continues to surge in the Philippines with 86.75 million users, or 73.4 percent of the population, active in early 2024, it begs the question: can these digital platforms play a transformative role in family planning (FP) awareness?A recent study by the Commission on Population and Development (CPD) and Bayer Philippines Inc. investigated this possibility, analyzing the impact of family planning content shared on social media platforms among men and women aged 18 to 49.Among 1,336 respondents (650 from CPD and 686 from Bayer), 71.24 percent of CPD respondents and 78.99 percent of Bayer respondents found digital initiatives on Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok with CPD’s “Usap Tayo sa Family Planning” page and the Bayer Philippines “Ask Mara PH” page very helpful for family planning.However, the findings also indicated that a small percentage, 4.44 percent (CPD) and 0.81 percent (Bayer), felt these resources were unhelpful. Additionally, while 14.86 percent (CPD) and 9.09 percent (Bayer) rated them as moderately helpful, there remains a notable gap in digital literacy that hampers effective usage.These findings, which were presented to the media and guests by CPD Acting Division Chief Mylin Mirasol Quiray, prompted Kevin De Vera, Director for Program and Advocacy at The Forum for Family Planning and Development Inc., to highlight the transformative potential of online platforms.He said that traditionally, family planning advice was sought from female relatives. However, digital platforms are now fostering gender equality by giving both men and women easy access to life-saving family planning information.De Vera said findings from the study indicate that many users felt motivated to seek family planning services and products after engaging with relevant content on these platforms. However, he raised concerns about the motivations behind this interest. “The primary reason is exploration,” he stated, noting that while curiosity is encouraging, it is also troubling.Globally, nearly half of all pregnancies are unintended, according to the United Nations Population Fund, with around 12 million unintended pregnancies occurring annually. In the Philippines, while the total fertility rate has been declining, the country still ranks 56th out of 160 nations for unintended pregnancies. This issue is further compounded by the rise in adolescent pregnancies, with over 56,574 live births among minors in 2022, up from 50,790 the previous year.Moreover, the study reveals a notable divide in FP methods among respondents from the CPD and Bayer Philippines. Among CPD respondents, 60.69 percent reported using natural methods, such as withdrawal and periodic abstinence, along with various folk practices, while 39.31 percent opted for modern artificial methods, which include short-term options like pills and condoms, long-term solutions like injectables and implants, and permanent methods like sterilization. In contrast, Bayer respondents showed a more balanced preference, with 50.42 percent using modern artificial methods and 49.58 percent relying on natural methods.Additionally, the study highlighted a high conversion rate for FP consultations and counseling, with 77 percent to 79 percent of participants seeking advice and 92 percent to 96 percent adopting some form of family planning.Among the respondents, a majority of those from the CPD sought services at private clinics (68 percent), while Bayer respondents preferred public health facilities (61 percent). This shift in preferences may be attributed to targeted boosting strategies on Facebook that influenced where individuals chose to seek care.Consultations and counseling were primarily provided by physicians, with oral pills and condoms being the most preferred methods, available at both public health facilities and pharmacies. More complex procedures, such as the insertion of progestin subdermal implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs), were predominantly performed in public health facilities, underscoring their critical role in providing access to comprehensive family planning services.Despite a strong likelihood of continuing with their chosen methods, many individuals cited reasons for not utilizing family planning options. These include need for more information or time to make a decision, difficulty in locating preferred healthcare facilities, affordability issues, and the necessity to discuss options with their partner.Despite the growing reliance on social media for family planning information, significant challenges persist. Angel Michael Evangelista, Managing Director of Bayer Philippines Inc., acknowledged the potential of digital platforms to disseminate expert-led content but highlighted their vulnerability to misinformation, especially in critical areas such as reproductive health and family planning, where inaccuracies can have serious consequences.Illustrating this point, De Vera, likened the situation to a pot on the stove, explaining that if someone knows a pot is hot, they wouldn’t put their hand in it.“That is the power of information. The choices individuals make about their health, future, and families are profoundly influenced by the information they receive—or, in many cases, the information they lack,” he said.However, De Vera raised additional concerns, noting that although social media exposure significantly impacts the contraceptive decisions of Filipino women and men, not everyone in the Philippines has reliable internet access.“Many young people still do not have access to accurate, timely information on reproductive health. This isn’t just about physical access to technology; it’s also about understanding how to find, verify, and act on information they encounter,” he said.The study emphasizes that socioeconomic barriers, along with cultural sensitivities, further limit the effectiveness of family planning communication.Experts in the field urge the national government, NGOs, and civil society to address these gaps and bridge the digital divide.“We need to invest in expanding not just the available resources in our Department of Education (DepEd), but also includes digital infrastructure, particularly in rural areas so that no young person is left behind,” he said.He emphasized the need for digital literacy initiatives that empower young people to navigate online spaces safely and effectively. Moreover, he advocated for integrating comprehensive sexuality education both online and offline to give young people a well-rounded understanding of their reproductive health.“We want a future where information poverty no longer prevents a young person from accessing family time services and where the digital divide is nothing but a memory of a past we have overcome. But the future will only come if we act now,” De Vera concluded.And this aligns with the call from the CPD, NGOs focused on family planning, and private sectors for the approval of Senate Bill No. 1979, also known as the Prevention of Adolescent Pregnancy Act of 2023."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/09/12/why-women-and-everyone-else-are-getting-vaccinated-against-hpv/,"Why Women, and Everyone Else, Are Getting Vaccinated Against HPV","Women from diverse backgrounds gathered for Guard Against HPV’s impactful panel discussion, “Her Story, Her Strength: Speaking Up on What We DeCerv” organized by MSD in the Philippines.The event featured compelling stories on health literacy from medical experts, practical insights into everyday preventive measures from influencers, and powerful conversations with advocates and survivors.Niña Corpuz expertly moderated the event with panelists Dr. Stephanie Veneracion, Liza Sta Maria, Jane Cheng, Aencille Santos, Jessica Tinio, Ivy Bermejo, Belay Fernando, Bea McLelland, Cheska Garcia-Kramer, and Kendra Kramer.Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a prevalent virus that can lead to significant health problems, including cervical, genital, and throat cancers, in both men and women. It is often spread unknowingly, as many people are asymptomatic.Dr. Veneracion, an OBGYN, describes it as a “silent pandemic,” noting that “[HPV] is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections and is responsible for over 95 percent of cervical cancer cases.” To combat HPV, she encourages the ABCDV approach: Abstinence, Be Faithful, Condom Use, Doctor Consult, and Vaccination.Celebrity mom and women’s health advocate Cheska Garcia-Kramer shares her approach to starting tough conversations about HPV at home with her daughter Kendra: “I know a lot of young girls are more comfortable talking with their peers, and young girls are also comfortable getting information through the internet. But I always remind her [Kendra] that your comfort should be with your mom. Because I love you. I don’t judge you. There are no questions too hard, too difficult, or too embarrassing that you can’t tell me.”Belay Fernando, former player and coach of the Philippine National Team for Women’s football, and a cancer survivor, reflects on her experience with the early symptoms of cervical cancer: “There were signs, but as Filipinos, as athletes, we were told to be strong. You have to put work ahead [or] this priority ahead. We weren’t really taught or told to prioritize our health or to listen to the signs of our body.”Bea McLelland, a beauty queen and advocate for cervical cancer prevention, highlights the lack of awareness about the disease: “Nobody really talks about cervical cancer. Not even with my friends, not in schools, not even within the family. They [medical professionals] opened my mind to it and how this is one cancer that can really be prevented with vaccination and early detection.”As part of the media, Jane Kingsu emphasizes the importance of getting the word out “in an easy and comprehensible manner,” especially as people now read less and watch more. She believes everyone has the power to influence others, and as advocates of health, it’s essential to address this proactively.Multi-hyphenate mom, content creator and law student Jessica Tinio reflects on how attending a previous “Di Mo DeCerv” talk inspired her to “try to research and to read more.” Echoing Kingsu’s emphasis on accessible information, Jessica highlights the importance of dedicating time to reading and research, which she finds pivotal in her journey to prioritize her health while balancing the demands of motherhood.Aencille Santos, a fitness content creator, believes that health is subjective but emphasizes four key areas to prepare against HPV: “movement, food, mind, and connections.” She stresses that these should be practiced consistently, even in small doses, as part of a daily routine.People, especially Filipinos, look at health differently. As Ivy Bermejo, a Financial Advisor, highlights, Filipinos often view health as a low priority. She emphasizes the importance of investing in preventive measures, noting, “If you add in the emotional cost, mental stress, financial cost–it makes sense why investing in this is a smart financial decision.”Each day, 12 Filipina women die of cervical cancer. Although it is preventable and treatable, this disease claims the lives of 350,000 women globally every year.Vaccines are proven to prevent HPV infections and significantly reduce cancer risks, making it crucial to expand access to these vaccines beyond traditional healthcare settings. Today, pharmacists are playing an increasingly vital role in this effort, with more becoming immunizing pharmacists trained to administer vaccines.President of the Philippine Society of Hospital Pharmacists, Liza Sta Maria, explains: “There is what we call pharmacy-based immunization. There are now certain pharmacies that are licensed to give the vaccines. [Through] proper training and certification, they would be able to administer the vaccines.”So, why should you get vaccinated today? Prioritizing regular screenings and vaccinations is necessary, not only for your personal health but also for the broader public health effort. By taking these proactive measures, you ensure that you’re doing everything possible to protect yourself and support the fight against HPV-related diseases.Guarantee your health and show that you’re committed to what you DeCerv—make the choice to get screened and vaccinated now.

Herbosa said.The DOH recorded a total of 102,216 cases of ILIs in the country from January 1 to August 24, 2024.This is 18 percent lower than the 125,153 cases reported during the same period last year.However, there has been an increase in cases over the last three to four weeks, consistent with the ongoing rainy season.All regions except Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao have shown an increase in cases in the recent four weeks.The 9,491 cases logged July 28 to August 10 is 55 percent higher compared to the 6,124 cases reported from the earlier period July 1 to 27.ILIs are a group of illnesses that present with common symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, colds, body aches, and headaches.The top three causes in the Philippines for this reporting period are: Influenza A (777, 28.5 percent); Rhinovirus (770, 28.2 percent); and Enterovirus (675, 24.7 percent).“Wash and clean hands often, and wear a face mask properly when sick or in crowded conditions to safeguard everyone’s health. These same measures protect against many other illnesses. Let us keep our case counts low,” Herbosa added.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/09/12/living-a-quality-life-despite-diabetes-is-achievable-experts/,Living a quality life despite diabetes is achievable–experts,"The Brussels, Belgium-based International Diabetes Federation (IDF), an umbrella group composed of more than 240 national diabetes associations in over 161 countries and territories, said that in 2021, there were over 4.3 million people living with diabetes in the Philippines, with about 2.8 million undiagnosed. This was based on the Philippines Diabetes Report 2000-2045 of the 10th edition of the IDF Diabetes Atlas in 2021.The same report added that the number is expected to grow more than 5.4 million by 2030 and 7.5 million by 2045.When someone is told that he or she has diabetes, the most common reaction, just like any ailment, is shock. Uncertainties and worries then follow, especially for those with families.If this were 10 to 15 years ago, receiving the news can be upsetting. However, with the advent of more modern treatment modalities and support materials, learning to live with diabetes may not be as difficult as before.THE initial shock of knowing that diabetes is always present but this dissipates after a while. After regaining composure, a person afflicted with the disease will be glad to note that there are now diabetes support groups that can provide vital information on how to combat diabetes and manage overall health. Working together, these groups find ways on how to adopt smart changes that can help them manage their condition and be able to live life to the fullest. In the Philippines, social media groups are a convenient way to connect with others who are facing similar challenges.The Philippine Diabetes Association (PDA), for one, holds annual conventions that serve as a venue for people with diabetes and their families to learn more about the disease and interact with others who have it.Aside from support groups, the emotional support from family and friends is important in understanding what diabetes, which is the leading cause of cardiovascular problems, strokes, end-stage renal disease, blindness, and lower extremity amputation, is all about. With their presence, they can help make adjustments adjustments and lifestyle changes in order to ensure effective health management.SOME experts believe that finding an effective healthcare team—doctor, registered dietitian, a physiologist, and other specialists—is crucial and are seen to provide expert advice in managing diabetes.Medical professionals have always reiterated that education is key in overcoming a medical challenge such as diabetes. Knowing more about the disease, the value of nutrition, the essence of exercise, and blood sugar management, together with legitimate and fact-checked resources and educational materials are all key essentials in diabetes management and in staying healthy.The presence of diabetes devices such as the Blood Glucose Meter (BGM) or glucometer, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), is also necessary. The blood glucose meters (BGMs), according to the ADA, “continue to play an important role in diabetes management. Understanding how they work is essential for your best diabetes self-management and to prevent or delay complications.” Experts noted that regular monitoring of blood sugar levels can help in understanding how the body responds to different food types, activities, and medications.Physical activity is also a vital part of diabetes management. Taking the stairs going up or down two floors in the office, going for a short walk, spending time at the gym or picking up a recreational sport, are good exercise activities. However, remember to consult a doctor first before engaging in any strenuous activities for the first time.THE Mayo Clinic advised of a diabetes diet that means “eating the healthiest foods in moderate amounts and sticking to regular mealtimes. It’s a healthy-eating plan that’s naturally rich in nutrients and low in fat and calories. Key elements are fruits, vegetables and whole grains. In fact, this type of diet is the best eating plan for most everyone.”The Scottsdale, Arizona, USA-based said that a diet for people living with diabetes “is based on eating healthy meals at regular times. Eating meals at regular times helps to better use insulin that the body makes or gets through medicine.”It said that a registered dietitian can help put together a diet “based on your health goals, tastes and lifestyle. The dietitian also can talk with you about how to improve your eating habits. Options include choosing portion sizes that suit the needs for your size and activity level.”Some doctors push for “portion control” to help manage blood sugar. It means creating a balanced meal, where 25 percent of a nine-inch plate is filled with protein, 25 percent with whole grains and starches, and 50 percent with non-starchy vegetables. It is also essential, according to medical experts, to eat regular, balanced meals and avoid skipping them, which can cause low blood sugar levels that can lead to fatigue, dizziness, and confusion. Skipping meals can likewise cause overeating that can lead to sudden spikes in blood sugar levels, which can be dangerous and cause long-term complications.If there is an urge to eat snacks, doctors advise to eat only the healthy ones like those low in sugar, sodium, and unhealthy fats to avoid blood sugar spikes and weight gain, and also protein-rich dairy products, fruits, vegetables, and small servings of nuts.Aside from that, blood sugar can be managed by considering taking diabetes-specific-formulas (DSF) like Glucerna. Dr. Jose Rodolfo Dimaano Jr., nutrition medical director for Abbott in Asia Pacific, said that DSF like Glucerna works by slowly releasing carbohydrates, which helps the body produce insulin naturally. It also contains inositol that helps convert sugar into energy that can be utilized by the body.Diabetes should not be considered as the end of the world for some, but probably just a new chapter in life. Living a fuller, high-quality of life can be achieved if one employs the right management plan that includes regular physical activity, a healthy diet, proper nutrition and medication as prescribed by a doctor."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/09/11/cheska-and-kendra-kramer-champion-open-dialogue-on-cervical-cancer-awareness/,Cheska and Kendra Kramer champion open dialogue on cervical cancer awareness,"Underscoring the importance of health education and open communication, celebrity mother-and-daughter duo Cheska and Kendra Kramer have introduced their new advocacy focused on cervical cancer awareness and prevention. The pair recently took center stage as panelists at the event “Her Story, Her Strength: Speaking Up on What We DeCerv,” organized by MSD in the Philippines, where they passionately discussed the vital role of family support in fostering awareness and understanding of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is mostly caused by an infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV), a group of more than 200 related viruses transmitted through intimate skin-to-skin contact. While cervical cancer is one of the only two cancers preventable through vaccination, 12 Filipinas die every day due to the disease. Since HPV can be sexually acquired, there remains a stigma surrounding cervical cancer, which can also contribute to the hesitance to seek medical care, including consultation, screening, and vaccination.Cheska, known for her role as a devoted mother and influencer, highlighted the significance of creating an environment where mothers and daughters can openly discuss health-related issues. “It is essential that we have open communication with our children,” Cheska shared. “With that open communication, Kendra gets to tell me everything she needs to tell her mom. Intentional Parenting is so important. With intentional parenting, they shouldn’t feel like they can’t come to us and speak to us about everything.”Kendra, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing how these conversations lay the groundwork for continued health awareness. “I’m very grateful that I have a very intentional mom who is always willing to make time for me despite how busy she is with her work. I leave no room for secrets with my mom, I tell her everything, anything I’m feeling. I like having an open communication with my mom,” she addedKendra, though still in her teens, has already become an advocate for her generation. She spoke about how these conversations with her mother have made her more aware of the importance of many health-related preventive measures, such as the vaccine for cervical cancer.The Kramers’ advocacy doesn’t stop at their own family. They are using their platform to encourage other families to prioritize health literacy and open communication. During the event, they stressed that cervical cancer prevention is not just a personal responsibility but a collective one that involves the entire family.“Because all information is now out in the open, I have more conversations with my daughters about diseases like this that happen. We’re open to talking about how we can find ways to prevent it. We remind them to value themselves, value your bodies, take care of your health, abd to listen to your body,” Cheska explained. “When it comes to vaccination, letting them decide when they are ready for things like this should also be considered.”Kendra added that being part of these conversations has empowered her to take an active role in her health. “If you know that you can prevent something, I think you should take the opportunity. It’s good to start young. I think it’s good we’re taking preventive measures, so we won’t need to worry about it in the future,” she shared.The Kramers’ advocacy is a testament to the power of family in driving change. By leading by example, Cheska and Kendra are showing that health education is not just about imparting knowledge, but about creating a supportive environment where that knowledge can be shared and acted upon.“When we know what prevention can do in terms of emotional, financial, and health, it helps us look forward to a better future. Getting informed is a priority. If you’re feeling anything, be brave and go to the doctor,” Cheska emphasized. “Talks like this are important as they make us feel like we’re not alone and that there’s always hope. There is hope when we do something about it, when we take the steps to prevent it.”Kendra encouraged young girls to be proactive about their health by learning more about cervical cancer and how they can take preventive measures, “I’m glad that I can use my platform to spread awareness on this disease, and it’s good that my followers can see it from account so that they can be more aware and educate themselves on this topic and learn the appropriate preventive measures.”The event brought together experts, advocates, and influencers to discuss the pressing issue of cervical cancer awareness and prevention. The event featured discussions on key topics such as health literacy, where experts, including Dr. Stephanie Veneracion and pharmacist Liza Sta. Maria provided accessible insights into cervical cancer prevention.Liza discussed that HPV vaccination is now available in some pharmacies, making it more accessible for women, “Pharmacists are now allowed to give vaccinations. There are pharmacists that are licensed to give the vaccines with proper training certification. They would be able to administer the vaccine.”Everyday Choices, the second segment of the discussion, highlighted practical strategies for incorporating disease prevention into daily life, with influencers like Aencille Santos, Jessica Tinio, and Ivy Bermejo, sharing tips on integrating wellness routines into daily routines, including busy schedules and finances. “Preventive measures in the Philippines range from 3,000 and above for screening and vaccination. Some public health programs even offer free vaccinations,” said financial advisor Ivy. “Early detection treatments are more affordable compared to treating advanced stages of cancer, which can run up to millions of pesos. There’s also still indirect causes like maintenance, after-treatment cost. If you think about it, investing in preventive measures is a smart financial decision as well.”Finally, the last segment, the Voices of Empowerment discussion, invited cervical cancer advocates like cervical cancer survivor Belay Fernando, who shared her story as she battled the disease, and beauty queen Bea McLelland, who continues to promote cervical cancer awareness to her audiences of all ages.Belay highlighted the role of a solid support system throughout her treatment, explaining, “Having my family and friends there for me has really helped me survive cervical cancer. They always made sure that someone was with me in every session, like radiation, chemotherapy, they’re always there. For me, beyond getting through treatment, I wanted to make sure that I live a meaningful life and did amazing things after for them because of what they put into my treatment.” She also acknowledged that some women fighting cancer today may not have the same financial and emotional support as her, overemphasizing the need for continued awareness of cervical cancer.As Cheska and Kendra Kramer continue to champion the cause of cervical cancer prevention, their advocacy serves as a reminder that the strength of family support can be a powerful force in the fight against diseases. Through their efforts, they are not only raising awareness but also inspiring others to take charge of their health and the health of their loved ones.Now, it’s time for everyone to take action—schedule regular check-ups with your doctor, and ask them about your and your family’s vaccine eligibility. Through these steps, Filipinos can protect themselves and their loved ones, helping to prevent cervical cancer and build a healthier future for all."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/09/07/increases-in-health-benefits-highest-in-priority-philhealth/,Increases in health benefits highest in priority – PhilHealth,"In a recent pronouncement, Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) President and CEO, Emmanuel R. Ledesma, Jr., reaffirmed the agency’s commitment to continue expanding its benefit packages following a series of enhancements introduced since last year, saying that this remains the Agency’s topmost priority.“,” Ledesma reported.PhilHealth’s coverage for dialysis has increased from 90 to 156 sessions, and payment per session has been raised by 51 percent from P2,600 to P4,000. This means patients can now enjoy up to P624,000 in annual coverage from the previous P405,600. Additionally, the benefit has been institutionalized and subject to “no balance billing” which means patients no longer have to pay on top of the increased package rate.“,” explained the PhilHealth chief.“,” he added.The health insurance agency has doubled coverage for hemorrhagic stroke (P80,000 from P38,000), ischemic stroke (P76,000 from P28,000), bronchial asthma (P22,488 from P9,000), and neonatal sepsis (P25,793 from P11,700), among others.Coverage under its Z Benefit Package for breast cancer has likewise been significantly increased from P100,000 to up to P1.4 million. It also added ultrasound and mammogram to the Konsulta Package to promote early detection of breast cancer among women. These additions are on top of the existing 13 laboratory tests and 21 medicines already available from over 2,000 Konsulta providers across the country that can be availed of free-of-charge once recommended by the provider.In February, PhilHealth also raised the case rates packages by 30 percent. Another round of 30 percent increase is set before the end of 2024. Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines (PHAPI) President Dr. Jose Rene de Grano confirmed during a recent meeting that, “,” he said.Members can also expect an increase in benefits for chemotherapy covering lung, liver, cervical, and prostate cancers, along with emergency care, open-heart surgeries, ischemic heart disease, cataract extractions, peritoneal dialysis, post-kidney transplant care, and severe dengue treatment also this year.Ledesma stressed that these measures aim to ease patients’ financial burdens, allowing them to allocate their money to other essential needs.“,” he concluded."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/09/05/digital-mindset-crucial-for-patient-safety-expert-says/,"Digital mindset crucial for patient safety, expert says","A digital mindset is essential for understanding the evolving healthcare landscape and improving patient safety through digital technology.“Everyone should have a digital mindset. It will be a farce if we don’t have this mindset because technology and innovation have come so fast that we don’t even know if we’re talking to a real human,” said Dr. Enrique Tayag, Infectious Disease expert from the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination. Dr. Tayag is also a former official of the Department of Health.Dr. Tayag was one of the panelists during the second day of the Philippine Patients Congress held on August 29 and 30, 2024 at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Mandaluyong City. The event was organized by the Philippine Alliance of Patient Organizations (PAPO) in collaboration with the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines (PHAP), ADB, and Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth).Among the topics discussed on Day Two of the Congress was patient safety and innovation.“Patient safety is struggling because of fake news. You don’t even have to get the results from a clinical trial because fake news can send you articles of clinical trials with dim results. And so therefore you will have a different idea about this.”“Everyone should have a digital mindset. We have to develop an approach that allows us to understand data and technology,” explained Dr. Tayag.A digital mindset is commonly defined as having a set of attitudes and behaviors towards the digital world. It means being open to new technologies, curious about their problem-solving potential, and comfortable using digital tools. In healthcare, a digital mindset is important to effectively leverage digital technologies to improve patient care, enhance efficiency, and drive innovation.“Having a culture of patient safety will not be enough because we have to understand the technology. We should have a mindset,” said Dr. Tayag.Dr. Tayag was also asked about how patient groups can help support the cause towards addressing vaccine hesitancy. He emphasized the importance of conversations and communication to help parents understand the benefits of vaccination.“For vaccine hesitancy, it’s not only important that we do surveys and know the reasons why there’s vaccine hesitancy, but there should be on the plate that vaccination saves lives.”“And we need to make sure that we win because the anti-vaxxers are multiplying in numbers out there. And they are providing fraudulent claims, fake news. And it will take a community of digital natives like us to understand what’s going on,” added Dr. Tayag.The Congress highlighted the patient advocacy movement in the Philippines and its impact on the country’s health ecosystem.With the theme “Hand in Hand for Universal Health Care,” the event brought together 300 patient advocates, caregivers, healthcare professionals, and representatives from the government, academe, and the private sector to elevate the dialogue on patient advocacy, as well as strengthen the united call to action to deliver on the promise of Universal Health Care (UHC).“Our organization is an institution built by different working hands. With our hands, we have the power to help, heal, serve, and support. The power of hands is the inspiration behind the key message of our Patients Congress, as we all come together, hand in hand, to elevate Universal Health Care in the Philippines,” said Karen Alparce-Villanueva, President of PAPO.Also known as “Kalusugan Pangkalahatan” or “Health for All,” Universal Health Care (UHC) is a government mandate that aims to ensure every Filipino receives affordable and quality health benefits by providing adequate human resources, health facilities, and health financing. Despite this mandate, many patients still pay out-of-pocket for their hospital bills.Keynote speaker Senator JV Ejercito, principal author of the UHC law, kicked off discussions for the first day of the Congress, focusing on pathways for ensuring support throughout the patient’s continuum of care.Day One’s panel discussion featured health advocates and leaders led by Dr. Eduardo Banzon, Director of the Health Practice Team at ADB and Emmanuel Ledesma, Jr., President and CEO of PhilHealth who shared perspectives and priorities in determining the role of private, public, and development partners in ensuring patient’s continuum of care.In December 2023, the ADB approved a US$450 million policy-based loan to aid the Philippines in increasing financing and sustaining coverage for UHC, helping strengthen health policy reforms and enhance Filipinos’ access to various health services.Day Two of the Congress focused on strengthening the patients’ voice and highlighted the importance of patient safety and innovation.Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/09/05/doh-to-publish-mpox-guidelines-for-business-establishments-soon/,DOH to publish mpox guidelines for business establishments soon,"Health Secretary Teodoro J. Herbosa said that it would be difficult to spread the symptoms associated with mpox where businesses work actively with health authorities.On September 3, 2024, Herbosa and Quezon City Acting Health Officer Dr. Ramona Asuncion DG. Abarquez, together with DOH and Quezon City health officials and staff members visited two establishments to discuss mpox prevention as part of their preparedness and response measures. Gruppo Barbero Manila and New York Spa along Timog Avenue in Quezon City welcomed a surprise visit by Herbosa and the composite DOH-QC health team. The public health officers learned about the operational concerns of the barber shop and the spa, especially in light of the current WHO declaration of mpox as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).The DOH is close to publishing its specific mpox guidelines for establishments and other settings.The DOH has been taking a consultative and participatory approach to formulating these guidelines, drawing upon its mandates under the Sanitation Code (Presidential Decree 856) and the Notifiable Diseases Act (Republic Act 11332).Herbosa said that DOH recognizes and is thankful of the cooperation of establishments like barbershops, salons, and spas in their response efforts against mpox. “Adherence to public health standards is best when there is a clear understanding of the science behind infection prevention and control,” added the Health Chief.“Better and wider risk communication is working, and so is improved access to consultation and testing. Anyone can get mpox, but it is crystal clear that the mode of transmission here is close, intimate, and skin-to-skin contact. Prevention is also clear: avoid intimate contact, especially anonymous ones with multiple sexual partners,” said Herbosa. “We continue to be on guard for mpox clade Ib. Our health system is active,” assured the health chief.Common symptoms of mpox are a skin rash or mucosal lesions, which can last for two to four weeks. The rashes are accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes. Anyone can get mpox.Mpox can be transmitted to humans through close, intimate (including sexual) contact with someone who is infectious, with contaminated materials like used clothes or utensils, or with infected animals.Soap and water can kill the virus. When washing contaminated materials, use gloves.Laboratory confirmation of mpox is done by testing skin lesion material by PCR.Current turnaround time at the DOH Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) is two to three days for testing.Dermatologists and other physicians who entertain a high index of suspicion are reminded to record the name and contact information of their patients and guide them to the nearest major hospital. Mpox is treated with supportive care. Patients with no other illnesses may stay at home after testing, until all scabs fall off and a new layer of skin forms, typically after two to four weeks.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/09/05/collaboration-is-key-to-preventing-obesity-in-the-workplace-expert/,Collaboration is key to preventing obesity in the workplace–expert,"Overweight and obesity are on the rise in the Philippines, emerging as a significant public health concern. In 2022, the prevalence of these conditions among individuals aged 20 to 59 reached a staggering 44.4 percent.Obesity is associated with significant comorbidities such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, venous thromboembolism, fatty liver disease and obstructive sleep apnea. Aside from that, obesity can also have an impact on an individual’s mental health, with depression observed among obese individuals.The condition is also very noticeable already in the workplace, where employed adult Filipinos are seen to spend about one-fourth of their time at work, majority of which are spent sitting down. When the employees get home, they pursue a sedentary lifestyle. It is believed that obesity can impact work opportunities and productivity.DR. Mark Isaiah Co, a Fellow of the Philippine College of Physicians (PCP), Training Officer, Department of Internal Medicine of the Central Luzon Doctor’s Hospital in Tarlac, and Diplomate of the Philippine College of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism (PCEDM), said during the PCP online health forum titled “Preventing Obesity and Weight Gain in the Workplace” organized by the PCP’s Committee on Mass Communications, that obesity can be described using the Three C’s. Obesity is now recognized as a Chronic disease and not just a condition due to lifestyle, Complex and Heterogenous, where the condition and the reason why it happens varies from person to person, and Catered to the individual, where treatment is “individualized” based on a person’s lifestyle.Screening of obesity is done using the Body Mass Index (BMI) where the weight in kilograms is divided by the square of the height (height is multiplied by itself) in order to get BMI. “It’s not the gold standard or most accurate, but it’s the easiest one to do and most widely used as a screening tool to determine if a person is at risk for complications of obesity so that other tests can be done,” Dr. Co said.The Philippines has its own guidelines on the screening and diagnosis of overweight and obesity, Dr. Co pointed out, where there are different guidelines compared to what is used internationally because of the difference in body type between Asians and Westerners.For adult Filipinos, he said, the recommendation is to use the Asia-Pacific criteria rather than that of the World Health Organization (WHO) global criteria. The Asia-Pacific BMI has a lower cut-off (≥23 kg/m²) for overweight and (≥25 kg/m²) for obese compared to the international criteria.In addition to using BMI, Dr. Co pointed out that the waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio can be used to diagnose obesity. The waist circumference cut-off for obese is ≥90 cm for males and ≥80 cm for females, while for the waist-to-hip ratio of ≥1.0 for male and ≥0.85 for female.“We have to remember that obesity has many roots, and it’s not just because one eats too much. Let’s try to remove that stigma. There are other factors like genetics, biology, the type of food we eat, access to healthcare, mental health, lack of good sleep, even endocrine conditions. There are a lot of things that need to be considered to prevent obesity,” Dr. Co emphasized.He likewise cited a statement attributed to Dr. Nemencio Nicodemus, Jr., President of the Philippine Association for the Study of Overweight and Obesity (PASOO) Inc., which stated that “according to the WHO, the factors contributing to the increasing problem of obesity in the Philippines include poor diets, inadequate nutrition, failing food systems and limited physical activity. These problems need multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary collaborations and solutions. Everybody needs to act!”There are many complications associated with obesity such as neurological, respiratory, urological, circulatory, psychological, nutritional, even reproductive. However, Dr. Co assured that when they make diagnoses on obesity, it is purely diagnostic and non-derogatory and done out of concern and not condescension.Obesity does have an impact on where employees work. Dr. Co pointed out the effects of obesity which include lower levels of productivity, the risk of disease and disability, stress at work and sleep problems which in turn results in decreased quality of life. Lack of sleep may also pose problems like workplace errors or worse, increased workplace hazard risk. Increased risk and disability and workplace accidents may lead to elevated number of mortality rates.Obesity has other risk factors in the workplace such as stress at work (conflict or harassment) leads to higher BMI and reduced physical activity. Social network may also lead to obesity in the workplace. An obese co-worker can lead to a 45-percent increase in the rate of obesity in an individual. “But this social network can also be harnessed for good where an employee can influence a co-worker who is obese to lose weight.”Long working hours, including a hostile working environment, were also associated with obesity, plus those who do night-shift work like call center employees, who have poor access to good food, lack of good sleep, and those who do sedentary work. While doing sedentary work is associated with obesity, this is still inconclusive, according to Dr. Co.FOR the workers, they have the responsibility to improve their health through proper nutrition and regular or consistent moderate to high-intensity exercise. Employers can help promote a healthy work environment by offering healthier food at the office canteen, vouchers for gym memberships, flexible working hours or longer breaks, even support for health insurance, and promoting active commuting options.However, if lifestyle interventions are unsuccessful, other options would be medical, either oral or injectable therapy, like for those with diabetes, Dr. Co cited. Also to be considered are meal replacements or medical nutrition therapy, bariatric surgery for those who are severely obese. For these treatments, Dr. Co pointed out that it is important to consult with a doctor and a nutritionist for proper meal planning.“Obesity is a major problem in the workplace that affects workers’ health and quality of life. Increasing awareness of obesity as a disease and making concrete steps to combat obesity will not only be beneficial for the employee but also for the employer, and such should be a priority. Since it’s Obesity Prevention Week, the PCP wants to do its part in spreading awareness about the health risks of obesity in the workplace” Dr. Co concluded.Image credits:"

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/09/04/cheska-and-kendra-kramer-advocate-for-cervical-cancer-awareness-and-prevention/,Cheska and Kendra Kramer advocate for cervical cancer awareness and prevention,"Underscoring the importance of health education and open communication, celebrity mother-and-daughter duo Cheska and Kendra Kramer have introduced their new advocacy focused on cervical cancer awareness and prevention. The pair recently took center stage as panelists at the event “Her Story, Her Strength: Speaking Up on What We DeCerv,” organized by MSD in the Philippines, where they passionately discussed the vital role of family support in fostering awareness and understanding of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is mostly caused by an infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV), a group of more than 200 related viruses transmitted through intimate skin-to-skin contact. While cervical cancer is one of the only two cancers preventable through vaccination, 12 Filipinas die every day due to the disease. Since HPV can be sexually acquired, there remains a stigma surrounding cervical cancer, which can also contribute to the hesitance to seek medical care, including consultation, screening, and vaccination.Cheska, known for her role as a devoted mother and influencer, highlighted the significance of creating an environment where mothers and daughters can openly discuss health-related issues. “It is essential that we have open communication with our children,” Cheska shared. “With that open communication, Kendra gets to tell me everything she needs to tell her mom. Intentional Parenting is so important. With intentional parenting, they shouldn’t feel like they can’t come to us and speak to us about everything.”Kendra, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing how these conversations lay the groundwork for continued health awareness. “I’m very grateful that I have a very intentional mom who is always willing to make time for me despite how busy she is with her work. I leave no room for secrets with my mom, I tell her everything, anything I’m feeling. I like having an open communication with my mom,” she addedKendra, though still in her teens, has already become an advocate for her generation. She spoke about how these conversations with her mother have made her more aware of the importance of many health-related preventive measures, such as the vaccine for cervical cancer.The Kramers’ advocacy doesn’t stop at their own family. They are using their platform to encourage other families to prioritize health literacy and open communication. During the event, they stressed that cervical cancer prevention is not just a personal responsibility but a collective one that involves the entire family.“Because all information is now out in the open, I have more conversations with my daughters about diseases like this that happen. We’re open to talking about how we can find ways to prevent it. We remind them to value themselves, value your bodies, take care of your health, abd to listen to your body,” Cheska explained. “When it comes to vaccination, letting them decide when they are ready for things like this should also be considered.”Kendra added that being part of these conversations has empowered her to take an active role in her health. “If you know that you can prevent something, I think you should take the opportunity. It’s good to start young. I think it’s good we’re taking preventive measures, so we won’t need to worry about it in the future,” she shared.The Kramers’ advocacy is a testament to the power of family in driving change. By leading by example, Cheska and Kendra are showing that health education is not just about imparting knowledge, but about creating a supportive environment where that knowledge can be shared and acted upon.“When we know what prevention can do in terms of emotional, financial, and health, it helps us look forward to a better future. Getting informed is a priority. If you’re feeling anything, be brave and go to the doctor,” Cheska emphasized. “Talks like this are important as they make us feel like we’re not alone and that there’s always hope. There is hope when we do something about it, when we take the steps to prevent it.”Kendra encouraged young girls to be proactive about their health by learning more about cervical cancer and how they can take preventive measures, “I’m glad that I can use my platform to spread awareness on this disease, and it’s good that my followers can see it from account so that they can be more aware and educate themselves on this topic and learn the appropriate preventive measures.”The event brought together experts, advocates, and influencers to discuss the pressing issue of cervical cancer awareness and prevention. The event featured discussions on key topics such as health literacy, where experts, including Dr. Stephanie Veneracion and pharmacist Liza Sta. Maria provided accessible insights into cervical cancer prevention.Liza discussed that HPV vaccination is now available in some pharmacies, making it more accessible for women, “Pharmacists are now allowed to give vaccinations. There are pharmacists that are licensed to give the vaccines with proper training certification. They would be able to administer the vaccine.”Everyday Choices, the second segment of the discussion, highlighted practical strategies for incorporating disease prevention into daily life, with influencers like Aencille Santos, Jessica Tinio, and Ivy Bermejo, sharing tips on integrating wellness routines into daily routines, including busy schedules and finances. “Preventive measures in the Philippines range from 3,000 and above for screening and vaccination. Some public health programs even offer free vaccinations,” said financial advisor Ivy. “Early detection treatments are more affordable compared to treating advanced stages of cancer, which can run up to millions of pesos. There’s also still indirect causes like maintenance, after-treatment costs. If you think about it, investing in preventive measures is a smart financial decision as well.”Finally, the last segment, the Voices of Empowerment discussion, invited cervical cancer advocates like cervical cancer survivor Belay Fernando, who shared her story as she battled the disease, and beauty queen Bea McLelland, who continues to promote cervical cancer awareness to her audiences of all ages.Belay highlighted the role of a solid support system throughout her treatment, explaining, “Having my family and friends there for me has really helped me survive cervical cancer. They always made sure that someone was with me in every session, like radiation, chemotherapy, they’re always there. For me, beyond getting through treatment, I wanted to make sure that I live a meaningful life and did amazing things after for them because of what they put into my treatment.” She also acknowledged that some women fighting cancer today may not have the same financial and emotional support as her, overemphasizing the need for continued awareness on cervical cancer.As Cheska and Kendra Kramer continue to champion the cause of cervical cancer prevention, their advocacy serves as a reminder that the strength of family support can be a powerful force in the fight against diseases. Through their efforts, they are not only raising awareness but also inspiring others to take charge of their health and the health of their loved ones.Now, it’s time for everyone to take action—schedule regular check-ups with your doctor, and ask them about your and your family’s vaccine eligibility. Through these steps, Filipinos can protect themselves and their loved ones, helping to prevent cervical cancer and build a healthier future for all."

As the only Philippine health and wellness app available globally, mWell provides mind health support to students, members of the workforce, and Overseas Filipino Workers. mWell Chairman and MPIC Chairman and CEO Manuel V. Pangilinan says, “mWell aims to transcend geographic boundaries and provide holistic wellness to our countrymen. Mental wellness is an important part of this. It helps keep us productive and empowers us to make the most out of our lives. We look forward to helping even more Filipinos take control of their health wherever they may be.”“Mind health is just as important as physical health.

In support of corporate wellness, mWell works with various companies to create customized programs promoting holistic health for increased productivity in the workplace. The Mind Health features equip members of the workforce with tools to address stress and anxiety, thereby enhancing overall work performance. Mental health continues to be a sensitive issue in the Philippines and the stigma that comes with it has led many to endure in silence. The Department of Health (DOH) reports that at least 3.6 million Filipinos suffer from mental, neurological, and substance use disorders. The Philippine Mental Health Association said there is less than one mental health worker for every 100,000 Filipinos. Access to mental health services remains limited due to the high cost of professional fees, ranging from ₱1,000 to ₱4,500 per session.To address the lack of access to mental health experts, mWell enables Filipinos to easily consult with certified mind health coaches and psychologists using the app. It has recently onboarded a team of experts from Mental Health Hour Manila. In partnership with the group, mWell introduces Mind Healthsavers—an exclusive package offering 30-minute video sessions with certified mind health coaches for as low as ₱499. The collaboration allows coaches, who are located across Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao and speak various dialects, such as Ilocano and Bisaya, to provide support and a listening ear without judgment in a fully confidential session. Mind health coaches can refer app users who require additional expertise to psychiatrists for specialized treatment.“In today’s world, while conversations about mental illness are growing, we must also create safe spaces that truly listen to those in need. Mental Health Hour Manila is committed to this mission, establishing support groups and one-on-one listening sessions. And with our partnership with mWell, we are expanding our reach to the most remote areas nationwide and even abroad– from adolescents to the elderly. Our goal is to bridge the gap between mental illness and support, break down the stigma, and empower individuals to be self-sufficient.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/09/03/phl-pharma-to-gain-from-us-firms-pivot/,PHL pharma to gain from US firms’ pivot,"THE Philippine pharmaceutical industry stands to benefit from the relocation of business operations of US multinational pharmaceutical firms as Southeast Asia is positioned to capture this growth opportunity, according to the (PPMA).In its economic outlook, BMI, a Fitch Solutions company, noted that Southeast Asia (SEA) is positioned to “leverage nearshoring for economic growth, with the pharmaceutical sector poised to benefit significantly from these trends.”Asked if the Philippine pharmaceutical industry will gain from this growth opportunity in the region, PPMA President Higinio Porte Jr. said, “Yes, because we are strengthening the capability of local manufacturers.”“We are also looking into partnering with multinational pharma companies to scale up Philippine operation and build facility in the planned Pharma Zone,” Porte told the in a Viber message on Monday.The PPMA head added a caveat: “We need to strengthen, though, regulatory processes to make it faster and easier.”According to BMI, “This transformation presents SEA with a significant growth opportunity, particularly as geopolitical tensions between Mainland China and the US continue to escalate with the likelihood of BIOSECURE Act being passed in the US.”BMI explained that the enactment of the BIOSECURE Act will “significantly” impact the US pharmaceutical market by necessitating a shift away from Contract Research Organizations (CROs) and Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs) based in “foreign adversaries” such as Mainland China.As such, BMI noted that geopolitical tensions are increasing pressure for decoupling, encouraging US multinational drug makers to seek alternative locations for their operations.“As a result, SEA is well-placed to capitalize on this shift,” the research firm noted, citing the region’s growing labor force, improving infrastructure and supportive governmental policies as the “favorable conditions” which make Southeast Asia an “attractive” destination for pharmaceutical firms looking to diversify their supply chains and reduce dependency on any single market.However, BMI said despite several competitive advantages for markets across SEA, such as the “favorable” labor costs in comparison to Mainland China as well as its “geographical proximity” to the rest of Asia Pacific region, the uptake of nearshoring initiatives has been slow.“The region has yet to fully harness the potential of nearshoring and foreign direct investment [FDI], both of which could be transformative for its economies,” said BMI.The BMI economic outlook noted that pharmaceutical sales in SEA are seen to rise from $29.2 billion in 2023 to $38.2 billion in 2028.However, the research firm pointed out that “the implementation of nearshoring, backed by targeted FDI, could significantly enhance these growth forecasts, catalyzing the region’s integration into global value chains.”For the Philippines, the BMI outlook noted, PPMA announced plans to increase local manufacturers’ share in government procurement from less than 5 percent to 50 percent by 2030, with the establishment of the Philippine Pharmaceutical Procurement to centralize procurement and create larger batch sizes for local manufacturers to make them more competitive.Last month, Philippine Economic Zone Authority (Peza) Director General Tereso O. Panga underscored that the proclamation of the Victoria Industrial Park in Tarlac as a special economic zone is a “major milestone for our push to see the first pharmaceutical ecozone operating within this administration, and ultimately, for the country’s overall pharmaceutical industry.”The Peza chief said the establishment of this industrial park is a “crucial” step in expanding the pharmaceutical sector within the country and will make medicines affordable and accessible.“We are optimistic that this will be the start, as we intensify our initiatives on this to achieve our goal of making the Philippines a global leader in pharmaceutical manufacturing,” Panga said in July 2024.Peza said the Victoria Industrial Park is seen to accommodate players in the pharmaceutical industry, diversify the pharma and medical activities in the country, and encourage the creation of other pharma zones nationwide.As of December 2023, Peza said it hosts 27 companies engaged in pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing, including Terumo (Philippines) Corporation, Arkray Industry, Inc., Royale Life Pharma Inc., JMS Healthcare PHL, Inc., Philipcare Medical Manufacturing Inc., Kaneko Medical Philippine Inc., Merck Business Solutions Asia Inc., and Cargill Oil Mills Philippines, Inc."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/09/02/historic-phl-patients-congress-bares-strategies-for-strengthening-patients-voice-in-health-policy-making-throughout-continuum-of-care/,"Historic PHL Patients Congress bares strategies for strengthening patient’s voice in health policy-making, throughout continuum of care","The Philippine Alliance of Patient Organizations (PAPO), together with the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines (PHAP), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), mounted the first-ever Philippine Patients Congress on August 29 to 30, 2024.With the theme “Hand in Hand for Universal Health Care”, this historic event brought together 300 patient advocates, caregivers, healthcare professionals, and representatives from the government, academe, and the private sector to elevate the dialogue on patient advocacy, as well as strengthen the united call to action to deliver on the promise of Universal Health Care (UHC).“Our organization is an institution built by different working hands,” says Karen Alparce-Villanueva, President of PAPO. “With our hands, we have the power to help, heal, serve, and support. The power of hands is the inspiration behind the key message of our Patients Congress, as we all come together, hand in hand, to elevate Universal Health Care in the Philippines.”Also known as “Kalusugan Pangkalahatan” or “Health for All”, Universal Health Care (UHC) is a government mandate that aims to ensure every Filipino receives affordable and quality health benefits by providing adequate human resources, health facilities, and health financing. Despite this mandate, many patients still pay out-of-pocket for their hospital bills.“Rest assured, I will continue to advocate for laws and reforms that prioritize patient-centered care, ensuring healthcare delivery in the Philippines is responsive, equitable, and inclusive.” This was the promise of Senator JV Ejercito during his keynote speech on the first day of the Patients Congress. As the principal author of the UHC Act, Ejercito has been pushing for amendments to the UHC Act, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.Aside from its role in funding and legislation, governments also play a crucial role in building capacity so civil society can have meaningful representation and contributions to health policies, explains Ogusa Shibata, Technical Officer for Health Care Quality and Patient Safety, Maternal Child Health, and Quality Safety at the World Health Organization (WHO).“Leaders from respective countries must set the example and pave the way to make participatory decision-making the modus operandi of the health system,” adds Shibata. “Champions are important across the health system, so we can embed social participation in the design and implementation of health policies and programs.” Social participation covers the entire continuum of care — from involving patients in drafting health policies, developing clinical practice guidelines, and managing safety for clinical trials, to upholding pharmacovigilance and post-marketing surveillance. Shibata also highlighted the recent WHO resolution on social participation for universal healthcare, emphasizing the need for sustained political will and investment in participatory processes. One of the best ways to embed champions across the health system is through patient organizations. From HIV/AIDS and breast cancer, to cervical cancer and psoriasis, the patient advocacy movement has been instrumental in raising the patient’s voice and forwarding meaningful change in healthcare delivery. “We have our rights, but we also have responsibilities. Let us all do something to uplift our health system,” reminds Ms. Fatima “Girlie” Garcia-Lorenzo, one of the founders of PAPO. Mr. Josef De Guzman, the founder and CEO of Psoriasis Philippines, emphasized the need for patient engagement in improving policy-making and raising public awareness for less-familiar diseases, such as psoriasis. Aside from firming up their mission and purpose, De Guzman also urged patient organizations to formalize their groups by registering and maintaining accurate records. In doing so, they put themselves in a better position to diversify their fund sources. Meaningful engagement means bringing the experiences of all stakeholders into the policy development process, shares Mr. Ralph Emerson Degollacion, OIC Managing Director of Health Justice Philippines. Using a case study on raising sin taxes to fund UHC, Degollacion also highlighted the importance of data in forwarding patient advocacy.“Policy change proposals must be data-driven and evidence-based,” he adds. “If there’s hard data, policymakers can’t just dismiss [your call to action].” Data is also key to countering misinformation and fake news in the digital age, especially regarding vaccination and clinical trials. While quantitative data, such as cost comparisons and spending data, are crucial in policy debates, patient organizations can lend a hand in collecting meaningful qualitative data — patient experiences. They can develop, assess, and adjust their key messages to reach and convince their target audience. “Choose your messengers within your core group — you can all be good storytellers,” adds Degollacion. Local leaders also have the power to bring their patient advocacy to the global stage, working with local and international partners to translate policies into actionable measures, reminds Dr. Durhane Wong-Rieger, President and CEO of the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders (CORD). Local patient organizations must overcome internal conflicts, learn from each other’s experiences, coordinate their efforts, and work both inside and outside the healthcare system to achieve their common goals — improving patient safety and care. “You have to talk to one another. Communication is probably the most important part of what [patient organizations] must do to stay together. Share problems and ways of working together. Can you work through finding solutions together?” adds Wong-Rieger. As the first-ever Patients Congress came to a close, Mr. Christopher Muñoz, Vice President of PAPO, encouraged patient organizations to upskill to understand health systems better, identify gaps, and provide evidence-based solutions to policymakers. “You have to be strategic and learn how to play the system. Learn where your strengths and weaknesses are to move things forward,” he adds."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/08/29/phl-sees-spike-in-dengue-cases-experts-cite-climate-change-and-urgent-need-for-dengue-vaccine-approval/,PHL sees spike in dengue cases: Experts cite climate change and urgent need for dengue vaccine approval,"The World Health Organization attributes the global surge in dengue cases to various factors including climate change, population growth, and increased global travel facilitating the spread of the virus. Rising temperatures and humidity due to climate change enhance mosquito breeding and the replication of the dengue virus. “Currently, dengue is on the rise, with climate change being a significant factor contributing to the increased disease transmission. The most critical factors associated with dengue are temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity,” said Dr. Bayo Segun, WHO representative, during his presentation at the first Dengue Summit held in Manila last June.The president of the Philippine Medicine Association (PMA), Dr. Hector Santos, underscored the potential rise in dengue cases in the coming months, attributing it to climate change and urging the public to be vigilant. He emphasized the need for collaboration among key stakeholders in strategically preparing to combat dengue.“The rising number of dengue cases serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for a unified front in the battle against this disease,” Santos stated, reaffirming the commitment to “Zero Dengue Death by 2030” in alignment with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 3.From January 1 to July 27, 2024 dengue cases in the Philippines increased by 33% with 128,833 cases compared to the 97,211 recorded in the same period of last year. Meanwhile, number of deaths went down to 337 from 378 in 2023. The DOH continues to remind the public of the importance of sustained measures and interventions especially during the rainy season. The heavy to intense rainfall caused by the recent or the southwest monsoon enhanced by severe tropical storm Carina are early indicators of La Niña. According to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) in early July, the 70% chance of La Niña occurring in August to October this year will trigger more rainfall in the country. Cooler conditions in the in the Central and Eastern Equatorial Pacific, complemented by the warmer temperatures in the Western Pacific close to the Philippines increase the likelihood of having more low-pressure areas or tropical cyclones. How does the changing weather patterns affect the rise of dengue cases in the country? Increased rainfall can create more breeding sites for mosquitoes, while the warmer temperatures can accelerate mosquito life cycle and replication rate of the dengue virus. In an interview with Dr. Anna Ong-Lim, infectious disease expert from the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination, she highlighted the critical role of climate factors among many others in driving dengue outbreaks. “The shifts in temperature can significantly influence the transmission of dengue. Given the persistent presence of dengue in our region, it is evident that climate change has the potential to intensify the transmission of the disease. Particularly concerning [is the impact of dengue among] children below the age of nine years, as they are more vulnerable to intensified transmission,” said Dr. Anna Ong-Lim, infectious disease expert from Philippine Foundation for Vaccination.During the inaugural Dengue Summit, health experts called on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve the second-generation vaccine against dengue as cases surge nationwide. This step is crucial in aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goal of achieving zero dengue deaths by 2030. “Vaccination reduces or eliminates the impact of variables dependent on behavior. Take COVID, for example. Prior to vaccination availability, preventive measures included mobility restrictions, mask-wearing, social distancing, and minimizing contact outside one’s household. Any lapses in adherence increased the risk of infection. However, with vaccines now available, community restrictions are largely lifted, offering built-in protection. The aim is to replicate this success with other infectious diseases. With vaccination, individuals can resume normal behaviors without fear of disease exposure,” Dr. Ong emphasized.The DOH has been reminding the public on the “5S” strategy: search and destroy mosquito breeding sites; uphold self-protection, like using insect repellents; seek early consultation at the nearest health care facility; support fogging, spraying and misting in hot spot areas; and sustain hydration for symptom management in dengue infection.In addition to this, Dr. Ong-Lim provided some practical tips to consider while the dengue vaccine is not yet available:Given the unpredictable weather patterns and mosquito behaviors, vaccination is highlighted as an important intervention for preventing severe cases of dengue infection, reducing dependence on behavioral measures.Rain or shine, dengue remains a persistent threat to public health. As we navigate through changing weather patterns and environmental conditions, it is crucial to remain vigilant in our efforts to combat this disease. While measures such as vector control and personal protection are essential, the availability of a dengue vaccine can strengthen the integrated prevention and control strategy against this century-old threat."

The project, tagged “Sight Saving Month: Cataract Outreach Year 3,” has already benefited more than 30 patients.AHMC and Intellicare inaugurated an exclusive wing dedicated to Intellicare and Avega HMO members last July 12, 2024. Located on the 10th floor of AHMC, the wing ensures that Intellicare members requiring admission will have access to dedicated rooms.“Asian Hospital really want more patients to access our services because we do have the best doctors in the world practicing here,” said Dr. Beaver Tamesis, AHMC President and CEO.“Our philosophy has really been let’s make sure we are accessible, that people get what they deserve. Hence, the tagline ‘Alagang Deserve, Alagang Sulit’ was born,” Dr. Tamesis added.Dr. Louie Agregado, Intellicare’s AVP for Medical Group, pointed out that Intellicare has had many firsts with AHMC. He mentioned that AHMC was the first hospital to agree to remove Intellicare’s bond with the hospital. AHMC was also the site of Intellicare’s first clinic.Another first was the surgical packages developed with Intellicare to bring affordability to patients. Dr. Agregado pointed out that “there is a stigma that Asian Hospital is very expensive, but when we packaged them, it becomes affordable to the common Filipino as well.”“This is the first time that we will have a dedicated wing for our members. We have been toying with the idea for the longest time, even before the pandemic. We are very grateful to Asian Hospital for accepting the idea,” he said.For his part, Dr. Michael John Encarnacion, Medical Director of Avega, said this exclusive wing would take patient experience to another level.“We will create that next-level customer experience. We talk about innovation, collaboration, and making a difference. Our North Star is the customer. On our doorposts in the rooms of the wing, it says Asian Hospital, Intellicare, and Avega are here to take care of you,” he said.The exclusive wing at AHMC represents a significant milestone in the strategic alliance between the two institutions.The month of August is Sight Saving Month. The celebration aims to emphasize the importance of protecting and taking good care of the eyes and to encourage the public to be aware of available means of restoring lost eyesight and the value of organ donation.With people spending more time in front of gadgets and digital screens, they have become more prone to developing “Computer Vision Syndrome.” According to Cleveland Clinic, computer vision syndrome is a type of eye strain that happens when a lot of time is spent using computers, smartphones, or other digital devices. Symptoms include dry, irritated eyes, blurry vision, and headaches. Treatment focuses on lubricating your eyes, correcting vision errors, and adjusting posture when using digital devices.“Patients who frequently use computers or cellphones often complain of a foreign body sensation, usually related to dryness. This issue is exacerbated in office environments where air conditioners or fans dry out the eyes, especially since people tend to keep their eyes open for extended periods. This lack of blinking and prolonged exposure can lead to increased dryness and discomfort,” said Dr. Beverly Rosas, Chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology at Asian Hospital and Medical Center.To ensure one is taking better care of their eyes, one can take an eye exam through an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive evaluation of eye health, including the detection of other underlying issues and a better understanding of overall eye health. Eye experts also recommend taking regular breaks from screen time, as well as having a balanced diet. For people who are required to have extended exposure to screen time, the 20-20-20 rule can also help reduce eye strain. This means that every 20 minutes, one should practice looking at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds.To commemorate this, AHMC Department of Ophthalmology in collaboration with Asian Hospital Charities Inc. (AHCI) held “Sight Saving Month Cataract Outreach Year III” last August 25, 2024, at the Dr. Jorge M. Garcia Surgical Suite.Led by Dr. Beverly Rosas, Chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology, a total of 17 patients were treated. Of the total number 16 of them underwent cataract surgery while one had pterygium removal surgery. So far, AHMC has helped almost 50 patients to date from partner communities, relatives of AHMC staff, and underprivileged patients of the Department of Ophthalmology recover their vision through eye surgery."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/08/29/government-intensifies-info-awareness-campaign-vs-mpox/,"Government intensifies info, awareness campaign vs mpox","The World Health Organization (WHO), through its Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced last August 14, 2024 that the outbreak of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo plus other countries in Africa is already a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).The declaration was based on the advice of an International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee of independent experts who reviewed data presented by WHO experts and affected countries, which said that the “upsurge of mpox to be a PHEIC, with potential to spread further across countries in Africa and possibly outside the continent.”A little over a week later, the WHO declared the launching of a “global Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to stop outbreaks of human-to-human transmission of mpox through coordinated global, regional, and national efforts.”The plan, which builds on the temporary and standing recommendations issued by the WHO Director-General, and will be implemented from September 2024 to February 2025, “focuses on implementing comprehensive surveillance, prevention, readiness and response strategies; advancing research and equitable access to medical countermeasures like diagnostic tests and vaccines; minimizing animal-to-human transmission; and empowering communities to actively participate in outbreak prevention and control.”Vaccination will be strategic, the WHO said, and will “focus on individuals at the highest risk, including close contacts of recent cases and healthcare workers, to interrupt transmission chains,” with “emphasis on strategic leadership, timely evidence-based guidance, and access to medical countermeasures for the most at-risk groups in affected countries” on a global level.According to WHO, this viral illness, formerly known as monkeypox and caused by the monkeypox virus, a species of the genus Orthopox virus, is classified as “zoonotic,” meaning it can be transmitted between animals and humans, and was discovered in 1958. It has two “clades” or group of organisms that includes a single ancestor and all of its descendants: clade I (with subclade Ia and Ib), which causes more severe illness and deaths, and clade II, said to be less severe, with subclades IIa and IIb. Subclade IIb was the one that caused the global outbreak of mpox between 2022 to 2023.Some of the more common symptoms of mpox include the showing of skin rash or mucosal lesions that can last for two to four weeks, together with fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen lymph nodes. It is transmittable through close contact with someone who has mpox, including sexual contact, contaminated materials, or infected animals. During pregnancy, the virus may be passed to the fetus, or to the newborn during or after birth, the WHO said.It is treated with care for symptoms like pain and fever, with focus on nutrition, hydration, skin care, prevention of secondary infections and treatment of co-infections, including HIV where present. Present treatment modalities include vaccination, and the WHO recommends “the use of MVA-BN or LC16 vaccines, or the ACAM2000 vaccine when the others are not available” only for those who are at risk or who belong to a group at high risk of exposure.At present, there are a total of 12 mpox cases in the country since July of 2022, according to the Department of Health (DOH). The agency already requested access from the WHO to secure around 2,000 doses of mpox vaccines.DR. Rontgene Solante, immediate past president of the Philippine College of Physicians (PCP), said during the PCP-organized online forum titled “MPOX in Focus: What Everyone Should Know” that the importance of the declaration of a PHEIC is to have a “coordinated response among countries in order to mitigate and control the infection.”Some of the high-risk populations, Dr. Solante pointed out, are children, pregnant women, and the immunosuppressed or those with weak immune systems.He was glad to note that the current mpox cases in the Philippines are clade II, which is the less severe form of mpox, with less overall risk posed by clade I, the more severe form, as long as surveillance and awareness in the detection of cases is enhanced.He noted, however, that imported cases are where the risks can be very high because of the circulating clade Ib in some countries, particularly in an Asian country like Thailand. But for the general population, Dr. Solante said, it is still very low provided that these imported cases “are diagnosed promptly and control measures are implemented.”Is the country ready?CAN the Philippines deal with mpox? Dr. Solante said the DOH has already intensified the information and awareness campaigns among government hospitals to enhance and intensify the epidemiological disease surveillance, using a different case definition that was initially used in a case that is a suspect and probable one in 2002. There is also the need, he emphasized, to enhance access to accurate diagnostic tests and continue with the genomic surveillance capability of the country’s different laboratory referral centers, and raise awareness among different clinicians, including laboratories.“This is not a problem, primarily, of infectious diseases, but we need to engage the primary care, the other specialty care including Sexually Transmitted Disease [STD] clinics, dermatology clinics, emergency department and pediatricians. Risk communications, which include community engagement that will be very crucial in raising awareness about this infection, how is it transmitted.”He added that related prevention and protective measures, including signs and symptoms, particularly targeting the high-risk groups, plus vaccinations probably should be part of the plan of the government in the next few months. “But more importantly is the implementation of a good infection prevention and control plan not only in the hospitals but also in the community.”"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/08/29/quality-testing-lab-owners-vets-push-for-safer-animal-feeds-fda-certification/,"Quality-testing lab owners, vets push for safer animal feeds, FDA certification","Healthy animals begin with good nutrition, which includes safe medicated feeds that can be ensured through certification by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).This was the call of the new Association of Veterinary and Agri-Quality Assurance Laboratories (AVAQAL) consisting of feed mill producers, veterinarians, and quality testing lab owners. The group banded to address concerns in the agricultural and veterinarian community and to forward them to concerned government agencies for sustainable solutions.Chemist Pinky Tobiano, AVAQAL president, said they aim to support government efforts and to uphold “harmonization” among the industry players. “In AVAQAL, we share our ideas in testing and we foster a spirit of camaraderie. We raise issues collectively as a group. Today, for instance, we’ve invited the FDA, BAI (Bureau of Animal Industry), and other experts for a discussion. Together, as one voice, we stand stronger as a group,” Tobiano said.“Our vision is to be the leading association in the Philippines that serves as a vital bridge between veterinary and agriculture quality assurance laboratories and government agencies. We are committed to ensuring regulatory compliance and excellence in all quality control standards,” she added.Likewise, the association is encouraging pet owners, and livestock and poultry raisers to check on the labels of the said products for FDA approval. In turn, ensuring that the drug animals ingest is safe and effective would also assure food safety among consumers of animal products such as meats, eggs, and milk among others.“Before, it was the BAI that regulated all veterinary drugs,” Tobiano said. “Now, there’s a transition, with the FDA. It’s a big change in veterinary and feed quality assurance laboratories. With this association, we can help those who make medicines for pigs, chicken, dogs and animal feeds.”BAI is mandated to study, report, and find ways to prevent communicable diseases among livestock. Generally, it aims to develop and advance the livestock industry. Among the roles of the FDA, on the other hand is to review animal food ingredients, approving safety of food additives, and checking the veracity of animal food labels and drugs, to name a few.To clarify rules and standards regarding the FDA certification of animal feeds, the group initiated a dialogue between members and government representatives such as Samuel Zacate, FDA director general, Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Deogracias Victor “DV” Savellano and Assistant Secretary Dante Palabrica.“The FDA certification for agricultural and veterinary drugs is not new, we’ve been doing it since the FDA law has been passed. So, we’re here today to partner with AVAQAL and other similar organizations to further clarify the procedure in the submission and issuance of the FDA Administration certification,” said Zacate in an interview withBusinessMirror.“In the past, BAI has been issuing the certificate of feed registration, which we also require for the FDA registration. So, I do not see any economic hampering in the transition of the registration from BAI to FDA. We will still acknowledge the past certificates issued by BAI. Hopefully, in due time, animal feed and drugs manufacturers will see the need to register their products with the FDA.”AVAQAL, on the other hand, is also working with both FDA and BAI against counterfeit animal pharmaceuticals listed by the two government agencies. Tobiano added, “Our association has quality control practices, so we monitor the fake medicines. “What is important is that the medicines or feeds that people buy for the animals are registered with BAI and FDA.”Besides the forum, the event also marked the oath-taking ceremony of new AVAQAL officers from various quality-testing laboratoies: Herbert Mendoza, vice president (Lipa Quality Control Center), Jessa Jane Mariano, secretary (Hoc Po Feeds Corporation), Chiqui Canlas, treasurer (Qualibet Testing Services Corporation), Leonardo Agoyaoy, auditor (Pilmico Animal Nutrition Corporation) and Yehlen Salilid Borja, director (FAST Laboratories).The association has lined up a series of monthly seminars to push their goal of uplifting veterinary and agricultural quality assurance laboratories in the country.This month, AVAQAL is pushing for regulatory compliance for veterinary laboratories and 3rd party testing laboratories by the FDA. In September, the association will hold a seminar on understanding the BAI regulatory compliance for feed testing laboratories.In October, the group tackles proficiency testing for Vitamin A in veterinary feed premix and crude protein analysis for soya bean. November includes a training session to provide comprehensive guidance of adhering to the regulatory requirements set by the DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources) and LLDA (Laguna Lake Development Authority). This will ensure compliance for the regulations in the feeds and drug testing laboratories.In December, the first AVAQAL awards night will recognize the best veterinary and agricultural laboratories in the Philippines."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/08/29/metro-pacific-health-decodes-common-myths-on-heart-health-and-dementia/,Metro Pacific Health ‘DECODEs’ common myths on heart health and dementia,"Being skinny and exercising means no risk of heart attack. Heart disease is always associated with chest pain. Only older adults are at risk for heart diseases, and you have to feel symptoms to have heart disease. These are some of the common heart health myths debunked in the recent Metro Pacific Health’s educational docuseries, DECODE.Metro Pacific Health (MPH), the largest network of private hospitals in the Philippines, successfully hosted a media roundtable on August 22, 2024, to discuss and review key topics from previous DECODE episodes, focusing on heart health and dementia—two critical health issues often misunderstood by the public.Dr. Saturnino Javier, Co-President and CEO of Makati Medical Center, addressed the widespread misconception that heart disease only presents with obvious symptoms like chest pain or that being slim and active automatically protects against heart conditions.“The truth is, heart disease can manifest in subtle ways, such as fatigue or shortness of breath. Less common symptoms might even include abdominal pain, back pain, and vision problems. Additionally, emotional stress and genetics are significant contributors to heart health. This is why it’s crucial not to ignore any signs, no matter how minor they may seem, and to prioritize regular check-ups,” explained Dr. Javier.Dr. Javier emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle through regular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding smoking, while also managing stress effectively to prevent emotional strain on the heart.“There are many predisposing risk factors to develop heart disease, stroke and vascular diseases such as hypertension or high blood pressure, high cholesterol in the blood. Stress is also a reason for developing cardiovascular disease, sedentary lifestyle, lack of exercise, being a couch potato.”“Being skinny and exercising is of course a plus point, but it will absolutely not prevent us from developing heart disease,” added Dr. Javier.He likewise shared that “the absence of not feeling anything is not necessarily synonymous with the absence of disease.”Dr. Javier said an ECG or electrocardiogram is a good screening test. An ECG is a simple, non-invasive test that can help diagnose certain heart conditions, including abnormal heart rhythms and coronary heart disease.“But there again is a myth that I would like to debunk. A normal ECG is not synonymous with a normal heart. A normal ECG is not necessarily equivalent to a normal heart,” said Dr. Javier.“You can only declare with certainty that the heart is okay if you go through all the sequences of testing that the doctor or the cardiologist feels you should undergo based on what you are presenting or complaining about. What I was trying to cascade is that not because you have a normal ECG, everything stops there,” Dr. Javier pointed out.To explain, he cited that experiencing chest pain and receiving a normal ECG does not necessarily indicate good health. Further tests, like stress tests, echocardiograms (2D echo), or angiograms, may be necessary to accurately assess heart health.The discussion then shifted to dementia; a condition often mistaken as a normal part of aging.Dr. Michelle Anlacan, Head of the Dementia Center at Cardinal Santos Medical Center, debunked the myth that dementia is inevitable as one grows older.“Dementia is a disease, not an unavoidable part of aging. Early diagnosis and proper management are key to improving the quality of life for those affected,” said Dr. Anlacan.She also addressed the myth that dementia solely affects memory, highlighting that the disease can also cause significant behavioral changes, disorientation, and speech difficulties. Dr. Anlacan emphasized the value and urgency of proper treatment when it comes to dementia.While there is no cure, treatment focuses on managing symptoms, addressing reversible causes like strokes or hypothyroidism, and improving quality of life through medication and non-pharmacological methods, with the likes of cognitive rehabilitation and therapy.Dr. Anlacan concluded by saying “intervention at the beginning stages and tackling risk factors, like chronic diseases, lifestyle choices, and social engagement, can help slow progression and generally just boost overall well-being.”The latest DECODE episode, which was premiered during the roundtable, focused on stroke—a leading cause of death and disability in the Philippines. The episode featured expert insights from Dr. Jennifer Justice F. Manzano, Program Director for the Asian Brain Institute at Asian Hospital and Medical Center; Dr. Cymbeline B. Perez-Santiago, Chief of Neurology at Makati Medical Center, and Dr. Jessa Torrefranca-Castro, Stroke and Vascular Neurologist at West Metro Medical Center.One of the most dangerous myths debunked in this episode is the belief that strokes are always painful or only affect older individuals.“In reality, strokes can occur silently and can affect people of all ages, especially those with underlying conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes,” said Dr. Manzano.The episode also highlighted the importance of recognizing early signs of stroke and seeking immediate medical attention, as prompt treatment is crucial for better outcomes.“Metro Pacific Health is committed to serving stroke cases with urgency and expertise through our network of 24 hospitals, including 10 stroke-ready facilities strategically located across the country to ensure immediate and effective care for those in need,” said Dr. Benjamin Co, MPH Group Chief Medical Officer.The 10 stroke-ready hospitals—De Los Santos Medical Center, Cardinal Santos Medical Center, Manila Doctors Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Marikina Valley Medical Center, Makati Medical Center, Asian Hospital and Medical Center, Calamba Medical Center, Davao Doctors Hospital, and St. Elizabeth Hospital Inc.—are currently fully equipped and ready to provide immediate and specialized care for all stroke patients.Throughout the roundtable, MPH emphasized its commitment to using DECODE as a platform for sharing essential health information that can empower Filipinos to take control of their health.By debunking myths and providing accurate, accessible information, DECODE aims to improve public health literacy and encourage proactive health-seeking behavior.“DECODE is our way of setting the record straight on health myths that many Filipinos still believe. By addressing these misconceptions head-on, we aim to empower our community with the knowledge they need to make informed health decisions,” said Jessica Abaya, MPH Group Chief Commercial Officer."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/08/29/empowering-mind-body-jal-yoga-expands-to-south-metro-manila/,"Empowering Mind, Body: Jal Yoga expands to South Metro Manila","By John Eiron R. Francisco Singapore-based Jal Yoga, a studio with a growing presence throughout Southeast and Western Asia, has launched its first branch in South Metro Manila, aiming to empower health and fitness education through its state-of-the-art facility and what it touts as an “authentic yoga” experience.Co-founder and director of Jal Yoga Studio Jasmine Loh told the BusinessMirror that their global expansion is driven by a commitment to bring authentic yoga to communities, with education at the core of this mission. She believes that for people to truly appreciate the value of practices like yoga, pilates, and barre, they must first be educated and understand the purpose behind what they are doing.“We believe that there’s no point if you just come once a week or maybe twice a month. You’re not going to reap any benefit, and also you’re wasting your time and money as well,” Loh said.She emphasized that yoga is not just about stretching muscles but is a commitment to achieving better health and a healthier life.TO address local market needs, Loh noted that regardless of the studio’s location—which was established in 2018 and has grown to include two branches and four additional studios in Singapore, three in Malaysia, and one each in Indonesia and Dubai—common issues such as stiffness in the neck, back, shoulders, and hips persist due to modern lifestyles characterized by extended desk work and computer use. In response, the studio has tailored its classes to target these problems, offering sessions designed to alleviate discomfort.Studies have shown that musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) significantly contribute to the disease burden in Asia, affecting individuals’ productivity, quality of life, financial stability, and work participation. According to the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, there were approximately 1,270,630 cases of MSDs, 652,005 new cases, and 137,832 years lived with disability (YLDs). Depending on age and symptoms, musculoskeletal conditions impact individuals of all ages across the globe.In the local context, MSDs rank among the top ten causes of YLDs.The studio, which features two large rooms and private rooms, offers a diverse range of classes suitable for all skill levels, including Infra Hatha, Vinyasa, Ashtanga, Kinetic Yoga, and Aerial Yoga.The Barre classes aim to help participants achieve a lean and toned physique through body-weight exercises, while Pilates classes focus on enhancing overall strength, balance, mobility, and well-being.Jal Yoga co-founder Pardeep Fogat noted that individuals of any age, fitness background, or body type are welcome to try their Yoga, Barre, or Pilates classes. The studio’s use of infrared technology is designed to make newcomers more comfortable during their workouts.Furthermore, Loh believes that these specially curated classes will benefit the local population and hopes that the increased participation, with regional membership exceeding 5,000, and the studio’s newest location in the Philippines, which officially opened at One Trium Tower in Alabang, Muntinlupa, on August 8, 2024, and has already attracted around 1,000 members before its official launch, will encourage individuals to pay more attention to their diet.“I know Filipino cuisine is very heavy on meat. It’s okay for us to enjoy, but we also need to moderate what we eat,” she said.She also observed that as individuals engage more in yoga, they often become more conscious of their dietary choices, which helps them fully reap the benefits of their practice.Meanwhile, Fogat stated that surpassing 600 members in the country in such a short time exceeded their expectations. They had expected it would take about a year to reach this number. This rapid growth has prompted them to start seeking new locations within Metro Manila.“Based on our plan, if we really go and look at all these locations, there is a potential of up to 15 to 16 locations we can open across the Philippines,” Loh said."

It strengthens bones and muscles, lessens the risk of chronic diseases, and improves mental well-being. What’s more, it’s completely free.If you have just started your running journey, give yourself a pat on the back, and follow these tips to keep on running.A GOAL in running can motivate you to keep going even on days when you just want to stay in bed and do nothing. If you set big objectives like running a half marathon or finishing a 10K run in under 45 minutes, try identifying smaller targets to help you achieve these. Start by increasing your weekly mileage one small step at a time, improving your pace, and building consistency.GETTING your desired outcome of your hard work is satisfying. It can boost your confidence to work even harder and, at the same time, helps you identify areas for improvement and adjustments you should make in your running routine. Download your preferred running app on your phone or invest in a good fitness tracker/watch to track your pace and distance, locate your routes, and give other features to enhance your runs.SOME lose their desire to run because it has become repetitive and bland. To avoid this, look for ways to add something exciting to your routine like buying a new pair of rubber shoes, running in a different spot or location from your usual, or elevating the difficulty of your runs.FUN runs and charity races are a great way to challenge yourself in a low-stakes environment. Through these, you can connect with other runners and even discover running groups that you can join. Some running events, like this year’s Run for Wellness, even have advocacies and causes that you can support via your participation.SOUTHSTAR Drug and Maxicare are bringing the second leg of the 13th Run for Wellness to Naga City on September 15, 2024 to empower Filipinos to become champions of their own and for others.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/08/29/asthma-attacks-hospitalizations-avoidable-with-correct-and-effective-care-say-doctors/,"Asthma attacks, hospitalizations avoidable with correct and effective care, say doctors","Medical experts from various fields of specializations are calling urgent attention to the right care for asthma. Multiple studies show that the inadequacy in the treatment of the chronic lung disease, which afflicts people of all ages, is creating problems for Filipino families and the health sector.The World Health Organization (WHO) says that asthma is often underdiagnosed and undertreated in low- and middle-income countries like the Philippines. This is further proven by a study from The Lancet, which indicated that an estimated 98 percent of Filipinos do not have access to adequate outpatient asthma care. The same journal showed that nearly half of Filipinos with asthma have inadequately controlled disease, making them prone to attacks or hospitalizations.With this inequity, it becomes more important that Filipinos get the right treatment every chance they get. Dr. Maria Janeth Samson, president of the Philippine College of Chest Physicians, said that high use of short-acting beta 2 agonist (SABA) like salbutamol alone, indicates poor asthma control.A study published in the Acta Medica Philippina journal found that an estimated 69 percent of hospital admissions due to asthma are from uncontrolled or partly-controlled cases.Dr. Samson, a pulmonologist, also cited the Canadian SABA In Asthma (SABINA) longitudinal study. The paper concluded that overuse of SABAs is linked to an increased risk of severe attacks.“Because of the quick sense of relief brought about by SABAs, it makes patients over-rely on this medication,” she said.The solution, doctors advise, is the more balanced approach that is headlined by the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommends the use of a combination ICS-formoterol inhaler as it both relieves symptoms and reduces the risk of asthma attacks. As both a reliever and controller of asthma, ICS-formoterol is GINA’s preferred option over SABA, which is solely for symptom relief.Dr. Guia Limpoco, trustee of the Philippine Academy of Family Physicians, and Dr. Anna Marie Putulin, president of the Philippine Academy of Pediatric Pulmonologists, echoed the call made by Dr. Samson. These practices align with reaching the ultimate goal of long-term asthma management, which includes preventing severe attacks and averting decline of lung function.“Treating asthma is a family affair,” Limpoco, a primary care physician, said as she emphasized the importance of a support system in dealing with asthma. “We have to check the techniques because there might be errors in carrying the treatment out which is why the symptoms cannot be controlled.”Dr. Putulin, a pediatric pulmonologist, meanwhile, expressed optimism as the science is already established to mitigate asthma. “We want to train children to address their asthma as early as now,” she explained while underscoring the importance of an active lifestyle among kids. “We encourage them to live a normal lifestyle, involve your children in sports.”Dr. Cyril Tolosa, medical affairs director of AstraZeneca Philippines, vowed to continue helping spread asthma care equity, driven by its bold ambition to eliminate asthma attacks and achieve clinical remission for all asthma patients.“It will take the entire ecosystem of stakeholders in health to change the landscape of asthma care in the country—the government, the private sector, patient groups, and of course healthcare experts,” said Dr. Tolosa.To achieve this ambition, AstraZeneca is championing respiratory health through programs like Breathe Better, a campaign that is building high consciousness among Filipinos regarding the risks and complications of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The campaign’s official page now has over 38,000 Facebook followers, helping answer the urgency to empower more Filipinos.The global biopharmaceutical company partnered with PAFP in advocating for the Asthma Action Plan, a simple tool recommended by GINA to help empower patients through guided self-management of asthma. In 2023, AstraZeneca also worked with PAFP, PCCP, and Mercury Drug to launch Asthma Care Hub, the first in-store end-to-end healthcare solution for patients with asthma. To date, there are now 14 hubs in Mega Manila.Agham Kapihan is a series of media roundtable discussions that seek to bring into light matters of science and health and advocate for innovation that benefits Filipinos. The forum is supported by AstraZeneca as part of its commitment to improving the lives of millions of patients together with its partners across the healthcare ecosystem."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/08/29/parents-group-reiterates-call-for-the-youth-to-stop-smoking-vaping/,"Parents’ group reiterates call for the youth to stop smoking, vaping","August is National Lung Month, the best time to reflect on how you are treating your lungs.If you smoke or vape, better kick the bad habit. Quitting smoking or vaping is one of the best things you can do for your health.Health experts says that smoking harms nearly every organ in your body, including your heart. Nearly one-third of deaths from heart disease are the result of smoking and secondhand smoke.Is switching from smoking to vaping a good thing?Vaping is a lot less harmful than smoking according to the tobacco industry. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) says otherwise as nicotine is the primary agent in regular cigarettes and e-cigarettes, and it is highly addictive.E-cigarettes, WHO said, have also been linked to an episode of lung injury in the United States of America. This is described by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury (EVALI), which led the CDC to activate an emergency investigation into EVALI on September 17, 2019.Meanwhile, Parents Against Vape (PAV) stressed that vaping is never a cessation tool for tobacco smokers as claimed by the vaping industry.PAV said that the purpose of vaping is not to induce smokers to quit, but rather to shift to a similar deadly product citing the first death documented in the Philippines due to EVALI early this year.“We have studies from our FGD that show that a) some youth vapers have never smoked but went directly into vaping; and b) smokers who vape become dual users because they go back to using traditional cigarettes if they don’t have money to buy vape juice,” PAV said.The 2019 Global Youth Tobacco Survey showed that one in every seven Filipino youth aged 13 to 15 vape. PAV said the number could be higher this year as indicated by the proliferation of vape shops across the country.While PAV calls for strict implementation Republic Act (RA) No. 11900 or the Vaporized Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Products Regulation Act, commonly known as the Vape Law, the organization is also pushing for the amendment of the law.“There are three things that should be done to keep our youth from vapes. First, increase access from 18 years old to 21. Second, limit flavors to menthol and tobacco. Flavors entice and get the youth addicted to vapes. And third, return regulatory power to the Food and Drug Administration,” PAV stressed.RA 11900 prohibits the sale and promotion of vape products within 100 meters of activity areas frequented by minors. It also bans flavor descriptors and cartoon characters in the packaging, labeling, and marketing of vapes that unduly appeal to minors.The Department of Health (DOH) said that quitting smoking and vaping is a challenging journey but through Brief Tobacco Intervention (BTI), it could be successfully done.According to Dr. Ronaldo Quintana, Medical Officer IV Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the DOH, BTI strengthens tobacco or vape users’ motivation to change their behavior and to carry out a cessation plan that will help them quit successfully.Dr. Quintana said: “We should all work together and aim for a future where smoking and vaping-related deaths are a thing of the past. Everyone’s commitment and dedication to this vital cause of saving lives should be sustained, sapagkat sa bagong Pilipinas, bawat buhay mahalaga!”The DOH said that vape liquids and their emissions contain chemicals such as nicotine, propylene glycol, carbonyls, and carbon monoxide that are either addictive, toxic or can cause cancer.PAV, on the other hand, echoed the call of WHO to strengthen implementation of the ban the sale of e-cigarettes and continue monitoring and surveillance to support public health interventions and ensure strong enforcement.“The dangers of vaping should be addressed for no tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, are safe, especially for teens and young adults,” PAV stressed.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/08/29/first-of-a-kind-antimicrobial-paint-now-available-in-the-phl/,First of a kind antimicrobial paint now available in the PHL,"While many companies strive to become number one in their field, this company wants to be known as a firm that listens and understands the wants and needs of their customers.It is because of this mantra that Sinclair The New Generation Paints partnered with BASF, a global leader in chemical manufacturing, to launch the Philippines’ first antimicrobial paint. Dr. Paint is poised to revolutionize the local paint industry by offering advanced protection against viruses and bacteria, setting a new standard for safety and performance.“When Covid-19 happened and as the owner of a chemical company, you think of how you can help the community. It happened that BASF had this technology to develop this paint, and we started talking to them probably two years ago,” related inventor Derrick A. Tan, President and CEO of Magna Prime Chemical Technologies, Inc. the maker of Sinclair the New Generation Paints.Magna Prime Chemical Technologies Inc. (MPCTI) is a premier Filipino chemical company known for pioneering and advocating for the right construction chemical products and methodologies. It is dedicated to advancing the standards of construction in the Philippines, aiming to achieve world-class quality through cutting-edge solutions.According to Tan, the talks between both parties were finalized in November 2023, where they agreed on the product would be promoted together with their brands. He added that both parties are happy that this product will be able to help a lot of Filipinos.“BASF told me that they would be more than happy to give this product to me on the condition that I had to make sure that Dr. Paint would be affordable to the people,” Tan said.BASF is a global leader in chemical manufacturing, renowned for its commitment to innovation and sustainability. Together with Magna Prime and Sinclair The New Generation Pain, they are transforming the market with products that cater to the evolving needs of consumers.Nicholas Chew, BASF’s ASEAN Industry Manager, noted that the Philippine market had been focusing on traditional paints and not much emphasis was placed on breakthrough paint products.“Magna Prime is different in a way because they focus on differentiation and what the customer needs. So that is actually what we are doing. Magna Prime focuses on the customer and this is very aligned with our vision,” Chew said.Dr. Paint is a water-based antimicrobial paint that is engineered to denature the protein cells of viruses and bacteria, effectively eliminating harmful microorganisms on wall surfaces.It offers enhanced defense against diseases such as influenza A viruses, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and Covid. It is the ideal paint for hospitals and other healthcare settings, childcare facilities, food processing areas, salons, health and sport facilities and other hygiene-critical environments.“With Dr. Paint, we are not just adding color to walls; we are adding a layer of protection. We are offering our customers added value,” Tan said. “This partnership with BASF allows us to bring a product to the market that aligns with our vision of combining aesthetics with advanced functionality.”Marian Tiemi Zanchetta-Sbragia, BASF Vice President for Dispersions Asia Pacific, added that while there are similar paint products that have been launched in other countries, Dr. Paint is the first of its kind to be launched in the country.“We can mention that in the Philippines, Dr. Paint is the first of its kind in the market. We have launched this similar product in other countries and BASF is the one that knows a lot about this technology. This is something that we have been developing together with Magna Prime for the last few years,” she said.Dr. Paint’s Inorganic Hybrid Technology features an alkaline-enriched micropore structure, courtesy of inorganic molecules, enabling in-can biocide free paints. These micropores also enhance the paint’s opacity, providing excellent coverage and stunning results.Dr. Paint’s antimicrobial properties are designed to combat prevalent viruses and bacteria, including Covid with 99.41 percent efficacy, Influenza Virus with 99.93 percent efficacy and hand-foot-and-mouth disease with 99.11 percent efficacy rate.It is also APEO-free, ensuring that the paint is safe for individuals with sensitive skin, and provides peace of mind for families and businesses concerned about health and hygiene.“This product is actually multi-functional. In addition to being antimicrobial, the product can even give you extra brightness. The paint can also last for at least two years, so it is very cost-effective,” said Dr. Lingqing Peng, BASF’s Senior Manager for Product Development.The launch of Dr. Paint coincided with the opening of Magna Prime’s first company-owned store, the BuildRite Hub and Sinclair Pro Store which is located in 189 Del Monte, Barangay Manresa, Quezon City to bring unparalleled accessibility and availability directly to National Capital Region consumers.The BuildRite Hub addresses common challenges faced by customers in acquiring high-quality construction materials, making it easier to purchase BuildRight products. The Sinclair Pro Store, on the other hand, offers a fresh and immersive experience in paint selection, going beyond color to emphasize textures and unique wall designs. In the Sinclair Pro Store, customers will encounter a new generation of paints that redefine the possibilities of home and commercial spaces.“What is important to us is accessibility and to have a good customer experience. We want to bring our customers close to our products and the technological advances that we have. We want to give back to the customers the power to decide what they want to purchase,” Tan said."

The Performance-Based Grants (PBG) were awarded to LGUs for achieving 100 percent of their PBG Tranche 1 nutrition targets under the project.The PMNP-PBG mechanism is a crucial financial and technical support provided by the DOH to its project municipalities to enable them to finance and implement interventions tailored to address the health and nutrition needs of pregnant women and children under five years old. Special attention is given to nutrition interventions in households with children in their first 1,000 days to contribute to the reduction of stunting and malnutrition in the country.The PBG amount to be received by the LGUs depends on their performance toward achieving their set nutrition goals and objectives under this sustainable multisectoral model for complementing internal revenue allotment for health and nutrition at the local level. In addition, it also provides financial flexibility for innovative measures, system strengthening, and service delivery, particularly for vulnerable populations, indigenous groups, and geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDAs).The Tranche 1 PBGs were awarded to the local chief executives of the 235 LGUs at the DOH-convened PMNP Mayors Forums held in July in Tacloban, Manila, and Davao, representing the Visayas, Luzon, and Mindanao clusters, respectively. At the events, municipal mayors showcased their engagements with their communities, targeted expenditures and strategic plans for allocation of resources for primary health care, nutrition, water, sanitation, and hygiene, and early childhood care and development, and their local visions, and strategies for effective nutrition governance to serve the needs of women and children in their communities. These efforts will be further supported by PBG financing.“Local Chief Executives and representatives are in the best position to effect change and influence better health and nutrition practices. The radical change in nutrition leadership and governance at the grassroots. Let us envision our municipalities with significantly reduced malnutrition rates, raising children with great cognitive abilities and excellent school performance, striving to be productive citizens towards a Bagong Pilipinas, kung saan Bawat Buhay Mahalaga,” said Health Secretary Teodoro J. Herbosa.All 235 PMNP municipalities are eligible to receive two more tranches of PBG: Tranche 2 amounting to P1.8 billion and Tranche 3 amounting to P1.1 billion. Through the DOH component of the PMNP, partner municipalities are set to receive a total of 3.5 billion pesos in PBG to fund nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions as detailed in their respective Municipal Nutrition Action Plans (MNAPs)."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/08/05/novartis-innovative-therapy-can-help-high-risk-patients-control-bad-cholesterol/,Novartis innovative therapy can help high-risk patients control bad cholesterol ,"Grace, a pseudonym used to protect her identity, is eagerly awaiting the birth of her granddaughter. However, the retiree in her early 60s and successful entrepreneur from Alabang is battling hypertension, diabetes, and high LDL-C (“bad cholesterol”). These comorbidities threaten to rob her of the chance to witness her granddaughter grow up and achieve milestones in life. High LDL-C levels resulted in the accumulation of fatty plaque deposits in the arteries of Grace’s heart. Because of her severely blocked coronary arteries, Grace suffered two heart attacks, the first in 2017 followed by another in 2018. Despite multiple open-heart surgeries and statin therapy to control cholesterol, Grace lives in constant fear that her health could take a turn for the worse at any moment. Research has shown that the is 6 to 9 times higher for people who have a history of cardiovascular events. Each year, heart disease and stroke claim the lives of 124,182 and 69,396 Filipinos, respectively, making cardiovascular disease (CVD) the leading cause of death in the Philippines.Many patients struggle to adhere to standard statin therapy due to side effects, such as chest pain and muscle cramps. Suboptimal adherence further increases the risk of cardiovascular events. Three in four Filipinos with heart disease do not reach their LDL-C goals, with little to no use of non-statin therapies. Such patients are at very high risk for another potentially fatal heart attack and stroke.To raise awareness about the risk of uncontrolled LDL-C and empower Filipinos to prevent cardiovascular events through a heart-healthy lifestyle, Novartis Healthcare Philippines together with the country’s leading cardiologists is conducting “Turning Second Chances to Lifelong Victories: The siRNA Roadshow.” There is good news. Recent research has shown that maintaining LDL-C levels under 70mg/dL can prevent plaque formation from progressing and can even lead to regression in plaque size.“Sustained lowering of LDL-C is essential to reducing CVD risk brought about by plaque formation. It can slow the progression of plaque formation, decrease the size of arterial blockage, and ,” said Dr. Lourdes Ella Santos, preventive cardiologist, clinical lipidologist & hypertension specialist.A 39 mg/dL reduction in LDL-C translates to a 22% reduction in the risk of another cardiovascular event.To minimize a patient’s risk of heart attack and stroke, cardiologists recommend the following LDL-C goals:● Low-Risk Patients = less than 116mg/dL● Moderate-Risk Patients = less than 100 mg/dL● High-Risk Patients = less than 70 mg/dL● Very High-Risk Patients = less than 55 mg/dLA new class of cholesterol-lowering treatment called small interfering RNA (siRNA) can help high-risk individuals like Grace reduce their LDL-C levels. Inclisiran is the first and only LDL-C-lowering siRNA therapy that selectively targets the liver. By preventing production of the target protein, Inclisiran increases hepatic uptake of circulating LDL-C, thereby reducing LDL-C levels in the blood stream. Inclisiran has been shown to reduce LDL-C by up to 52% with just two doses per year. This reduction in LDL-C levels further decreases the risk of heart attack and stroke, especially in people having difficulty reaching their LDL-C goal with traditional therapy. Inclisiran works best with statin therapy and is an exciting addition to proven effective therapies for LDL-C control.Three months after getting the Inclisiran injection and starting aggressive statin therapy, Grace reduced her LDL-C from around 60 mg/dL to below 40 mg/dL levels.“Inclisiran stays in the body for just 48 hours and has a lasting effect of up to 6 months. This means that the risk for long-term adverse reactions is extremely low, even in patients with diabetes and other comorbidities,” said Dr. Adriel Guerrero, acardiologist.Recent advancements in medical treatments have made it possible for individuals like Grace to turn second chances to lifelong victories. By working closely with your cardiologist and taking a proactive approach to managing bad cholesterol, you can regain control over your health and live a healthier, fuller life.“We need to help patients see that controlling their LDL-C is not an expense but an investment in their health so they can continue living longer and living well,” said Joel Chong, Country President of Novartis Healthcare Philippines.Experts strongly recommend that people with a history of heart attack or stroke consult their doctor about the optimal LDL-C goal and ideal treatment option to optimize their health and achieve better cholesterol control.Your accumulated years of exposure to LDL-c can be used as an estimate to your plaque burden and your average risk for the first heart attack.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/08/03/sc-asked-to-stop-transfer-of-idle-philhealth-funds/,SC asked to stop transfer of idle PhilHealth funds,"THE Supreme Court has been asked to stop the administration of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. from transferring to the national treasury and utilizing “excess funds” of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) amounting to P89.9 billion for other purposes except for its members’ health care.The petitioners led by the Philippine Medical Association (PMA) also asked the court to immediately order the return of the P20 billion taken away from PhilHealth by the Department of Finance (DoF) by virtue of DOF Circular No. 003-2024.The DOF circular—drawing legal justification from the 2024 budget law—directs the transfer of unused subsidies from government-owned and -controlled corporations (GOCCs), specifically PhilHealth, to the national treasury to bolster the government’s unprogrammed appropriations.It was issued in line with Section 1 (d) of XLIII of the General Appropriations Act 2024, an “inserted” provision on unprogrammed appropriations.Both the DOF Circular No. 003-2024 and Section 1 (d) of XLIII of the General Appropriations Act 2024 are being sought to be declared unconstitutional for violating the people’s right to health.The petitioners insisted that PhilHealth has no excess funds considering that the promise to fully finance universal health care under the Universal Health Act (UHA) remains unfulfilled since its passage five years ago.“More so, there clearly is a deficit of care and compassion from this administration. Redirecting these vital funds away from healthcare is a betrayal of the most vulnerable among us,” the 38-page petition read.“The future of millions of Filipinos hangs in the balance, and the petitioners implore the Honorable Supreme Court to act now to protect the citizens’ right to health and the promise of a better tomorrow,” it added.The petitioners asked the Court to issue a temporary restraining order or a status quo ante order/writ of preliminary injunction as immediate relief pending the resolution of the petition on the merit.The immediate relief is necessary, according to the petitioners, to preserve or restore the status prior to the transfer of the P20 billion in May 2024.This would also prohibit the DOF from further implementing Circular No. 003-2024Named respondents in the petition were the House of Representatives, represented by Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez; Senate of the Republic of the Philippines, represented by Senate President Francis “Chiz” Escudero; Finance Secretary Ralph Recto; Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin; and PhilHealth, represented by its President Emmanuel Ledesma Jr.The petitioners lamented that no consultations were made by the government prior to the transfer of the funds.The petitioners argued such inserted provision of the 2024 GAA is unconstitutional for being a rider, which violates Article VI, Section 25 (2) and Section 26 (1) of the Constitution.Section 26 (1) of the Constitution, on the other hand, states: “Every bill passed by Congress shall embrace only one subject which shall be expressed in the title thereof.”“Despite Congress being vested with the powers of appropriation, the Constitution demands that the expenditure of these funds have distinct ‘items’, qualifications, limitations, or conditions to which they are subject. The provision fails to meet this criteria, making it unconstitutional,” the petitioners said.By diverting the funds to the unappropriated programs of the national budget, Congress has given the Executive branch the discretion to decide how to spend funds which have been earmarked specifically for the implementation of the UHA, the petition said.Petitioners said the DOF circular violates Article VI, Section 29 (3) of the Constitution: “All money collected on any tax levied for a special purpose shall be treated as a special fund and paid out for such purpose only.”The transfer, said petitioners, also violates Republic Act 11346, which earmarks revenues from excise taxes on tobacco products and sugar-sweetened beverages for PhilHealth’s initiatives in line with UHA.“Reclaiming subsidies meant for the disadvantaged population places an unbearable burden on those already struggling,” the petitioners stressed.The PMA was joined by Senator Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III, former Finance Undersecretary Cielo Magno, Dr. Ma. Dominga Padilla, and the Sentro ng mga Nagkakaisa at Progresibong Manggagawa, among others, as petitioners.In a statement on Friday afternoon, DOF’s Recto said: “While we have yet to receive a copy of the petition and read its contents, we respect the right of the petitioners to seek clarification from the Supreme Court regarding the legality of the PhilHealth unused subsidy [fund balance].”The DOF, he added, is “ready to answer any question on the legality of DOF Department Circular 003-2024 which is an implementation of a direct mandatory Congressional order under Section XLIII (1)(d) Republic Act No. 11975, or the General Appropriations Act 2024. Further, legal due diligence was exercised through coordination with the Governance Commission of GOCCs (GCG), the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC), and the Commission on Audit (COA), all of whom have issued a favorable opinion on its legality.”He reiterated his conviction that “public health deserves the full support of the government—a position which I have maintained in my three decades in Congress. I want to make it clear that I never opposed any recommendations to reduce PhilHealth member contributions.”Recto said: “I reiterate that whatever measures by the government to source financing for its programs and projects are undertaken consistent with the belief that its capacity to address the primary needs of our people—including health—is not compromised. This is borne out by the fact that the President has already announced that the PhilHealth will enhance its benefits, with improved medical aid packages for a broad range of illnesses, such as pneumonia, hypertension, and cancer.”A UST journalism graduate, has been working as a reporter for more than 20 years."

But equally important is supportive care which focuses on the patient’s continuity of care from hospital to home and back,” Dr. Corvera related.Dr. Corvera related that family meetings will be called so that the patient and the family will know what is needed in their transition from the hospital to the home. It is also important for the family to know the triggers that will require the patient to be brought back to the hospital.“There are doctors and nurses who can actually visit them at home and we are looking to include laboratory services as part of the home service to lessen the stress of having to go to the hospital. We also have on board nutritionists, psycho-oncologists, derma-oncologists, counselors and even integrative medicine specialists to help patients during this time,” she added.The kick-off program started with a beautiful rendition of “The Prayer” and was followed by an inspirational message from Dr. Beaver Tamesis, AHMC President and CEO. Dr. Tamesis pointed out that when the Asian Cancer Institute was founded, it has become a Center of Excellence to be able “to deliver the best possible care be it surgical, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, for all our cancer patients.”“Along the road, there was a need for a more holistic approach so now we included integrative services, home care, counseling, and family support. The Asian Cancer institute can bring all these aspects together for our patients,” he said.One of the key segments was “The Supportive and Integrative Care Opus,” presented by Dr. Corvera and Dr. Maria Antonia Yamamoto. This talk delved into the significance of supportive care and the innovative approaches the Institute employs to provide it.The event also featured a unique segment, “Music as our Medicine,” where Sharon Vicente Hernandez and Dave Vicente, along with awarded violinist Merjohn Lagaya, presented a moving testimony through words and music, showcasing the therapeutic power of this art in the healing journey.Attendees had the opportunity to engage in “Conversations with Cancer Patients” led by Dr. Alex Delgado, a Medical Oncologist, fostering a supportive community atmosphere. This was followed by a talk on “Spiritual Care: A Pillar of Holistic Care” by Physician Chaplain and Medical Oncologist Dr. Susano Tanael, Jr.The ACI Chorale also performed “Stronger Together,” a piece symbolizing unity and strength. Melissa de Leon Joseph, President of Project Pink, delivered a “Message of Life,” sharing inspiring stories and messages of hope.The event culminated with the “Lighting of the Wishing Tree,” an interactive public information project by The Ruth Foundation in partnership with Chrys 2-SIS Asian Hospital. This symbolic activity allowed participants to write their wishes if faced with a chronic illness and messages of support, fostering a sense of community and collective hope.The harmonious celebration honored the strength and resilience of cancer patients and continued to advocate for integrative and supportive care.The kick-off event was followed by the showing of the film titled “Wit” on July 8 at the Tumor Board Meeting Room. The “Brave Conversations” Webinar on Dementia Dialogues and Advanced Care Planning was held on July 13. The Asian Cancer Institute will have regular webinars regarding this topic and other Supportive Care Services. Last July 17, the Institute gave cancer patients the opportunity to try acupuncture at the Tumor Board Meeting Room. A webinar on “The Importance of Identifying, Assessing and Managing Distress in Chronic Illness” was held last July 20. On July 24 and 25, the Institute hosted “Harmony Hallways” Supportive Care Exhibits and Booths.The last day of the month-long celebration of the Asian Cancer Institute was held on July 24 with “Synchronizing our Song: A Multidisciplinary Case Discussion.” This was followed by “Cheers to the Symphony: Wine and Cheese Thanksgiving Fellowship.”"

Moreover, the hospital will support PRC in blood donation activities.Signing the agreement were PRC Chairman and CEO Dick Gordon, PRC Secretary-General Dr. Gwen Pang, AC Health Chairman Fernando Zobel de Ayala, and AC Health Vice Chairman Cezar Consing.“We’re still responding to those affected by the typhoon (Carina), but I came here because this partnership is very special to me. Ayala has been our partner for many years, especially during our fight against the pandemic. PRC and Healthway Cancer Care Hospital share the same mission and that is to alleviate the suffering of people,” said Gordon.Pang added, “With PRC’s 108 blood service facilities, 32 blood centers, 76 blood collecting stations, and 15 apheresis centers, the partnership will be well supported. This is a crucial step in our fight against cancer. I’m confident that this partnership will have a positive impact on cancer care and I hope this will inspire more collaborations and partnerships for better health care for Filipinos.”Consing said, “When they mentioned this partnership to me, I remember when two people close to me were in dire need of blood during Covid. In desperation, I called Chairman Gordon and told him our blood needs. Within two hours, blood was delivered. Hence, I think of no better partner than the PRC.”Ayala pointed out that “Ayala Corporation has always believed in the power of collaboration to drive positive change. PRC’s collaborative spirit and unwavering commitment have been instrumental in our journey as the first comprehensive cancer care hospital in the Philippines.”As one of the country’s major blood suppliers, PRC collected a total of 538,666 units of blood in 2023. This year, PRC’s target is to supply 70 percent of the country’s demand for blood.Since April, PRC has been partnering with various hospitals, starting with Cardinal Santos Medical Center and St. Luke’s Medical Center to ensure adequate blood supply for vulnerable patients."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/08/01/st-lukes-medical-center-quezon-city-expands-with-new-hospital-building/,St. Luke’s Medical Center Quezon City expands with new hospital building,"Groundbreaking ceremonies for the new 13-story building of St. Luke’s Medical Center (SLMC) in Quezon City took place on Monday, July 29, 2024. This event signifies a major step forward in the hospital’s redevelopment, which aims to modernize and expand its facilities without compromising patient care.“This is essentially the first step towards what our Board of Trustees and the administration have promised our doctors, the promise of having the best hospital, not just in Quezon City, but probably in Metro Manila. We promise to make this the best, the most modern hospital, better than Global [St. Luke’s Global]. And for sure, it will be prioritized over what we are doing in Aseana because Quezon City is the birth site of St. Luke’s. This is where it all began,” said Dr. Dennis P. Serrano, SLMC President and Chief Executive Officer.Serving as a healthcare cornerstone in the metropolis since its establishment in the 1960s, SLMC Quezon City has outgrown its current facilities as the demand for its services has soared over the years. Recognizing the evolving needs of patients and the healthcare landscape, St. Luke’s embarked on a redevelopment project to elevate its services and infrastructure and serve the community even better.The new hospital building will house nearly 80 percent of the hospital’s existing serviceswith 140 nursing unit beds. Despite its large scale, the new building will be constructed on a limited footprint, taking up just 10% of the total area. This efficient use of space allows for uninterrupted patient care.The renovation of the Quezon City hospital will cost around P6 billion. The new hospital building is expected to be completed in 2027. It will be equipped with state-of-the-art medical technology and designed to prioritize patient comfort and safety."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/08/01/qc-launches-vax-roadshow-to-eliminate-cervical-cancer/,QC launches vax roadshow to eliminate cervical cancer,"THE local government unit (LGU) of Quezon City has launched a one-of-a-kind mobile vaccination campaign to put an end to the deadly human papillomavirus (HPV) or simply called cervical cancer, which kills a dozen Filipino women every day.Held in the first district of the biggest LGU in the metro, this pioneering effort is aimed at bringing vital immunization services directly to the community via a mobile roadshow.This five-week initiative of the city government, which started last July 9, 2024 and runs every Tuesday until August 6, is supported by the Quezon City Health Office and all barangay captains of District 1. By making vaccines accessible to hundreds of girls aged nine to 14 in Quezon City underscores the importance of preventive healthcare in mitigating the incidence and impact of the HPV.The kick-off event was led by no less than Quezon City District 1 Councilor Charm Ferrer, who is a cervical cancer survivor herself. In her speech, Ferrer recalled the ordeal she underwent with six chemotherapies and 32 radiation therapies. “Now as a public official, it is my duty to ensure the health and well-being of my constituents. With this landmark initiative, we will ensure that all our adolescent girls in Quezon City will be vaccinated. We support Mayor Joy Belmonte’s vision of road to zero cervical cancer in Quezon City,” Councilor Ferrer said.“Cervical cancer can be prevented through vaccination and screening. By taking concerted action as one community against HPV, we can ultimately eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem,” she added.CERVICAL cancer is still a big health malady, particularly in Asia, where it accounts for 58 percent of global deaths from HPV. In the Philippines alone, at least 12 women die daily from this disease, making it the second most prevalent cancer among women aged 15 to 44. While it has an adverse effect on families and the entire community, given the financial and emotional burden it causes, this type of cancer that is highly preventable, thanks to the combination of HPV vaccination and cervical screening that can provide the greatest protection against this illness.“We are fortunate to have this program for the youth to prevent cervical cancer. Had there been like this in the ‘ 80s or ‘90s, maybe there would only be a few women who succumbed to cervical cancer, one of them was my eldest sister,” said Council Woman Marissa Reyes, chairperson of Barangay Bahay Toro Health Committee. BY and large, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set ambitious global targets to address cervical cancer. These include inoculating 90 percent of girls with the HPV vaccine by age 15, screening 70 percent of women by ages 35 and 45, and guaranteeing 90 percent of women with pre-cancer or invasive cancer receive the right treatment. Reaching these ambitions need a multi-sectoral approach involving individuals, families, communities, civil society, and government agencies.Heeding this call, Quezon City’s HPV vaccination roadshow supports the Department of Health’s fight against cervical cancer, which necessitates collective action to protect every Filipino woman by making healthcare services and vaccines available to all communities.This is apparent in the initial success of the program, where less than 100 adolescent girls were given a shot of HPV vaccine and 31 female adults were screened for cervical cancer.More than 200 participants attended the kick-off event, including representatives from various community organizations, barangay and city health departments, civil society groups, and the private sector.“This is a significant milestone in our fight against cervical cancer.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/08/01/fda-has-regulatory-authority-over-health-aspects-of-tobacco-products-says-sc/,"FDA has regulatory authority over health aspects of tobacco products, says SC","The Department of Health (DOH) has recognized as a “significant victory” for public health the recent decision of the Supreme Court (SC) affirming the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the health aspects of tobacco products in the country.The landmark ruling penned by Senior Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F Leonen upholds the Court’s 2021 Decision by denying the motions for reconsideration filed by the Philippine Tobacco Institute, Inc. (PTI) and empowering the DOH and FDA to continue their crucial and constitutional work to regulate tobacco products, thereby reducing the health risks associated with tobacco consumption.“We see this decision by the Supreme Court as a triumph of justice in favor of health for our people. We thank the wise Justices of the Supreme Court for this landmark decision. This ruling not only supports the DOH and FDA’s efforts to protect public health, but also underscores our commitment tungo sa Bagong Pilipinas kung saan Bawat Buhay Mahalaga,” Health Secretary Teodoro J. Herbosa said.For Parents Against Vape (PAV), the ruling is as an opportunity to return the regulatory power over vape and electronic cigarette products to FDA.“This is another reason for our legislators to amend the Vape Law. The Parents Against Vape has been consistently calling on our lawmakers to amend the law and return the regulatory power to FDA,” Rebie Relator, president of PAV, said.Relator added that the SC has already affirmed the regulatory authority of the FDA over the health aspects of tobacco products.“It’s about time that our legislators do their part to correct the Vape Law,” Relator added.Health of generations of FilipinosWhile lauding the SC decision, the DOH stressed that it is a decisive step against the tobacco industry’s attempt to “circumvent regulations.”The DOH said that the decision promotes and guarantees the health of generations of Filipinos, both living today and yet to be born.“In line with the public health goal to protect Filipinos, especially the youth, from the harmful effects of smoke and emissions from tobacco products, vapor products, and heated tobacco products, this decision supports the gains of the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act, the National Integrated Cancer Control Act, and many other health laws,” the DOH said.The DOH said that the DOJ’s opinion also aligns with the Department’s 5th Action Agenda, “Pag-iwas sa Sakit,” by implementing healthy public policies and strengthening intersectoral action and health promotion governance at all levels.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/08/01/astrazeneca-ac-health-partner-to-push-for-early-screening-of-lung-cancer-through-ai/,"AstraZeneca, AC Health partner to push for early screening of lung cancer through AI","AstraZeneca, a science-led, patient focused pharmaceutical company, and AC Health, a healthcare corporation with a portfolio that includes hospitals, clinics and digital health, have partnered to push for early screening for lung cancer utilizing AI through the Lung Ambition Alliance.Lotis Ramin, AstraZeneca Philippines Country President, pointed out that in the Philippines, lung cancer is second in terms of incidence but number one in terms of number of deaths. According to Global Cancer Observatory, lung cancer accounted for 20,963 deaths and has become the second most common cancer in terms of incidence with other 23,700 new cases in 2022.Lung cancer’s high mortality rate and low survival rate, both mainly determined by the stage at diagnosis, is a challenge to Filipino patients, having low access for early screening. In fact, 60 percent of lung cases are already in the advanced setting, significantly decreasing the five-year survival to 2.9 percent.The earlier the disease gets diagnosed, the better the survival rate becomes, with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) having a five-year survival rate ranging from 13 to 36 percent while in stage 1 NSCLC, it can be as high as 68 to 92 percent.“That is the reason why we are pushing for this ‘Lung Ambition Alliance.’ It is an alliance to move the needle in terms of driving a stage shift in early diagnosis in lung cancer but also working through the whole ecosystem to make sure that the patients are guided from awareness, screening, diagnosis up to treatment,” Ramin said.The Lung Ambition Alliance is a global coalition with the bold ambition to eliminate lung cancer as a cause of death. By building a network of partners across various health sectors, the alliance aims to accelerate progress in lung cancer survival rates and outcomes. The alliance represents patient groups, scientific and medical communities and industry, bringing knowledge and skills together to help reach this bold ambition.“This is a huge feat and we believe that not one organization can do this alone. AstraZeneca started this project tin the Philippines more than three years ago and we have activated multiple partners including laboratories, private and public hospitals and even with a party list,” Ramin said.“In line with our bold ambition to eliminate lung cancer as a cause of death, AstraZenca is committed to creating value for Filipinos beyond the impact of our life-changing medicines through early detection, education, and treatment. With our partners in the alliance, we pledge to screen at least one million Filipino patients by 2026 for lung cancer, enabling early intervention that will change disease trajectory of lung cancer in the Philippines,” Ramin added.Paolo Borromeo, President and CEO of AC Health, underscored that ultimately, it is the patient who benefit when innovation comes to healthcare.“AC Medical Network and Healthway Cancer Care Hospital continue to deliver the best value oncology services because we work with some of the best partners all over the world, AstraZeneca being one of them,” he said.Astra Zeneca have partnered with Qure.AI to bring qXR, an AI solution, a triaging tool for lung cancer screening to the Healthway Cancer Care Hospital in Taguig and Healthway Qualimed Hospital in Sta. Rosa, Laguna. Through qXR, Filipino patients get a means to avail themselves of early lung screening backed by the efficiency of artificial intelligence.Qure.AI’s qXR is a world’s most widely used AI for chest screenings using a simple chest X-ray. It is a triaging tool designed to improve diagnosis, promote better efficiencies on who should be screened with low dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan, and boost optimal management of patients with lung cancer. This breakthrough technology can provide physicians with pre-read assistance in as fast as 20 seconds. The scans made via qXR can get findings on the lungs, heart, diaphragm and bones.The use of LDCT Is established to be cost-effective and has demonstrated a 20 percent reduction in lung cancer mortality due to diagnosis at earlier stages of the disease. However, this is not widely implemented in routine lung cancer screening due to limited access.The integration of AI-supported chest X-rays with LDCT would further improve cost- efficiencies and enable more opportunities for routine lung cancer screenings and early detection for lung cancer.“We are looking at this collaboration as a bright spot in shoring up our ecosystem. Through you, we will be able to rewrite the stories of people who have lung cancer,” said Menchie Auste, Cancer Coalition Philippines Vice President."

By making vaccines accessible to hundreds of young girls in Quezon City aged 9 to 14, the program supported by the Quezon City government, Quezon City Health Office and barangay captains of District 1, underscores the importance of preventive healthcare in reducing the incidence and impact of cervical cancer.Quezon City District 1 Councilor Charm Ferrer, who is a cervical cancer survivor herself, led the launching and underscored the importance of the fight against HPV.“Sobrang hirap po magkaroon ng cervical cancer. Nag-undergo po ako ng six chemotherapies and 32 radiation therapies. Now as a public official, it is my duty to ensure the health and well-being of my constituents. With this landmark initiative, we will ensure that all our adolescent girls in Quezon City will be vaccinated. We support Mayor Joy Belmonte’s vision of road to zero cervical cancer in Quezon City,” Councilor Ferrer said during the launch.“Cervical cancer can be prevented through vaccination and screening. By taking concerted action as one community against HPV, we can ultimately eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem,” she added.Cervical cancer remains a significant health burden, particularly in Asia, where it accounts for 58% of global deaths from the disease. In the Philippines alone, at least 12 women die daily from cervical cancer, making it the second most frequent cancer among women aged 15 to 44. The financial and emotional toll on affected families and the broader community is immense. However, cervical cancer is a type of cancer that is highly preventable. The combination of HPV vaccination and cervical screening can provide the greatest protection against this disease.“Napakapalad natin at may ganitong proyekto para sa mga kabataan para makaiwas sa cervical cancer. Siguro kung meron lang nito noong mga 80s or 90s, baka konti lang ang maysakitng cervical cancer na naging dahilan ng kanilang kamatayan,isa sa kanila ang panganay kong kapatid na babae,” said Kagawad Marissa Reyes, Barangay Bahay Toro Health Committee Chairperson. Over 200 participants attended the kickoff event, including representatives from various community organizations, barangay and city health departments, civil society groups, and the private sector. “This is a significant milestone in our fight against cervical cancer. This is a moment of hope, empowerment, and making a difference. We can create a future where cervical cancer is a thing of the past,” Dr. Lani Buendia, Quezon City National Immunization Program Medical Coordinator.The HPV vaccination roadshow supports the Department of Health’s fight against cervical cancer, which calls for collective action to protect every Filipino woman by making healthcare services and vaccines accessible to all communities.During the launch, less than 100 adolescent girls vaccinated were vaccinated against and 31 female adult were screened for cervical cancer. The next legs of the HPV vaccination roadshow aims to vaccinate hundreds more of target school girls and continue to provide breast and cervical cancer screenings to adults.The World Health Organization (WHO) has set ambitious global targets to eliminate cervical cancer, including vaccinating 90% of girls with the HPV vaccine by age 15, screening 70% of women by ages 35 and 45, and ensuring 90% of women with pre-cancer or invasive cancer receive appropriate treatment. Achieving these goals requires a multi-sectoral approach involving individuals, families, communities, civil society, and government agencies."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/07/25/doh-reminds-public-of-leptospirosis-health-risk-due-to-floodwaters/,DOH reminds public of leptospirosis health risk due to floodwaters,"The Department of Health (DOH) reminds the public of the health risk of leptospirosis due to floodwaters as may get leptospirosis by wading through floodwaters or handling soil/mud/dirt after a flood, with or without visible wounds, through exposed skin. The DOH observed that as of Morbidity Week 28 (July 13, 2024), the total number of leptospirosis cases stands at 1,258.In the six weeks before July 13, leptospirosis cases have been on a downtrend – from 175 cases last June 2-15, to 154 cases last June 16-29, to 111 cases last June 30 to July 13. However, case counts may still rise due to late reports, and especially with recent weather events like the enhanced Southwest Monsoon.The number of reported cases of leptospirosis this year (1,258 as of July 13, 2024) is 41 percent lower compared to the same period in 2023, when there were 2,150 cases reported.However, the DOH, withoit hibing any figure, nkted that the following regions had increases in leptospirosis cases from June 2 to July 13: Zamboanga Peninsula, CARAGA, SOCCSKARGEN, Western Visayas, MiMaRoPa, Eastern Visayas, and Northern Mindanao. There were 133 deaths have already been recorded due to leptospirosis as of July 13.The DOH said that symptoms can take as long as one month to appear.” There are antibiotics available for prevention (i.e., prophylaxis), and this requires a prescription. Consult your nearest doctor or health center within 24 hours after wading through floodwaters or touching soil/mud/dirt after a flood,” the DOH said.Meanwhile, DOH Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said that it is better not to wade in flood waters.“Mas mabuti pong umiwas sa baha at putik para makaiwas magka-Lepto. Sa mga kailangangang lumusong, gumamit ng bota hanggang tuhod. Hugasan agad ang katawan ng malinis na tubig at sabon pagkatapos. Kumonsulta agad sa doktor, wag maging kampante kasi matagal lumabas ang sintomas,” said Herbosa. Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection transmitted by many animals, such as rodents and other vermin. Waste products (e.g., urine and feces) of an infected animal, especially rats, contaminate the soil, water, and vegetation.It is is a zoonotic disease, affecting both animals and humans, caused by the leptospira bacterium found in contaminated water or soil. Leptospira bacteria can enter the body through breaks in the skin, or through the eyes, nose and mouth. Infected animal urine like those from infected rats can mix with flood water, which then comes into contact with people wading through or playing in it. Without treatment, leptospirosis in people can lead to kidney damage, meningitis (inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord), liver failure, trouble breathing, and even death.Leptospirosis symptoms include fever, vomiting, nausea, muscle pain, and headache. Some cases have distinct pain in the calf muscles, and reddish eyes. Severe cases may have jaundice (yellowish body discoloration), dark-colored urine, light-colored stool, low urine output, and severe headache. Many of these symptoms can be mistaken for other diseases; some people have no symptoms.It generally takes 2-30 days to get sick after having contact with the bacteria that cause leptospirosis. Therefore, people must consult doctors immediately after being exposed to (wading or playing in) flood waters as there is a preventive antibiotic prescription, the DOH said.Image credits: Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/07/25/early-detection-education-is-key-in-combating-ckd/,"Early detection, education is key in combating CKD","THE body has two kidneys that are about the size of a human adult’s fist and located on either side of the spine just below the rib cage, according to New York, USA-based National Kidney Foundation (NKF). These hardworking organs perform many functions, particularly in helping remove waste and excess fluid from the body, regulate blood pressure as well as the amount of nutrients in the body like calcium and potassium, among others.How do the kidneys perform their life-sustaining job? The kidneys filter and return fluid to the bloodstream, a portion of which are retained in the body, and another portion is discarded through urine.So why do many people suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease or CKD? Experts say the cause of kidney diseases are mostly lifestyle related such as consumption of unhealthy food, alcohol, smoking, that may lead to risk factors that can cause CKD like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, old age, or even family history.Unfortunately, symptoms of CKD are hardly noticeable until it reaches an advanced stage or as more complications develop. The NKF said about 37 million adults in the US are living with CKD, with approximately 90 percent of them not even knowing they have it.In the Philippines, CKD is one of the leading causes of death as the National Kidney Transplant Institute (NKTI) said that one Filipino develops chronic renal failure every hour, estimated to be at least 2.3 million Filipinos currently diagnosed with CKD. Other recent projections show that one in 10 Filipinos will develop this deadly disease.TO help spread awareness about CKD, patient organizations and medical societies came together to celebrate National Kidney Month by helping Filipinos detect the early symptoms of CKD and educating them on prevention.This was done through an event titled “It Starts with U: Get CheCKD” that was supported by Boehringer Ingelheim (Philippines), Inc. Several experts and partner organizations were present during the event like Rey Abacan Jr., President and Founder of Dialysis PH; Marimel Lamsin, Internal Vice President of the Kidney Transplant Association of the Philippines, Inc. (KITAP); Karen Alparce-Villanueva, President of the Philippine Alliance of Patient Organizations (PAPO); and Dr. Rose Marie Rosete-Liquete, Executive Director of NKTI.The experts who attended the event shared with the audience the prevalence and dangers of CKD, and how Filipinos can adopt simple yet effective measures to protect themselves. They said CKD is one of the most common chronic illnesses in the Philippines and part of its danger is the difficulty in early detection since its symptoms don’t manifest until it’s too late.However, renowned nephrologist Dr. Maaliddin Biruar, who was the key expert of the talk, said this condition can be easily mitigated by regular testing and adapting a few lifestyle changes.“Early detection and regular medical consultations will help prevent the progression of CKD in our patients, ensuring better quality of life and productivity. By addressing the risk factors of CKD such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, we can also reduce the socioeconomic burden of treating end-stage CKD,” Dr. Liquete pointed out.The event also enabled Boehringer to launch their new disease awareness website ItStartsWithYou.com.ph, a web page that contains data and information on CKD that patients and the public can freely access.“Accessible tools and education are essential in combating CKD. With tools like this websit e, we can empower Filipinos with the knowledge and understanding for detecting CKD early and managing it effectively. Early detection through accessible testing can significantly improve outcomes and enhance the quality of life for those affected by this silent but serious condition,” according to Dr. Greta Cortez, Head of Medicine for Human Pharma, Boehringer Ingelheim Philippines.Throughout the duration of the event, families enjoyed educational and entertaining activities at different zones where they checked for CKD and learned the importance of adopting healthy habits to prevent the disease.“We are happy to see that more Filipinos are taking a proactive step towards taking care of their kidneys. We are committed to improving the lives of Filipinos with interconnected cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic disease, which CKD is a part of. The best way to make lasting change is by educating our communities, healthcare providers, patients, and their families,” concluded Dr. Cortez."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/07/25/doh-celebrates-national-cpr-day-with-hands-on-demonstrations/,DOH celebrates national CPR day with hands-on demonstrations,"Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency lifesaving procedure performed when the heart stops beating. To promote this lifesaving skill, the Department of Health (DOH) through its Health Emergency Management Bureau (HEMB) and Communication Office (COM) celebrated the inaugural National Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Day.The celebration is in line with Proclamation No. 511, signed by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., which declares July 17 of each year as “National Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Day.”The event aimed to raise awareness about CPR as a critical lifesaving technique in emergencies such as cardiac arrest and near drowning. Participants, including media partners, received hands-on demonstrations of Hands-Only CPR using high-fidelity mannequins led by DOH Assistant Secretary Dr. Albert Francis E. Domingo. The goal of this event is to educate the public until each and every household member has the capacity, knowledge and skills necessary for this lifesaving technique.Key attendees in the event included DOH-HEMB Director Dr. Bernadette Velasco, Department of Education (DepEd) OIC-Director Atty. Suzette T. Ganaban-Medina, Philippine Red Cross (PRC) Secretary General Dr. Gwendolyn Pang, Philippine Heart Association (PHA) President Dr. Rodney Jimenez, Philippine College of Emergency Medicine (PCEM) President Dr. Jeremy A. Cordero, and American Heart Association (AHA) Southeast Asia Regional Faculty Dr. Vicente De Lima. This initiative supports the Department’s 8-Point Action Agenda—Ligtas, Dekalidad at Mapagkalingang Serbisyo, aiming to ensure the provision of high-quality, safe, and people-centered services, including access to affordable medicines, across all life stages.“Empowering individuals with CPR skills is a crucial step towards building a resilient and health-conscious community. By equipping every household with this lifesaving knowledge, we can significantly increase the chances of survival in emergency situations, advancing our vision of a Bagong Pilipinas kung saan Bawat Buhay Mahalaga,” said Health Secretary Teodoro J. Herbosa.The PRC , meanwhile, said that 15,000 participants across 90 of their chapters nationwide, engaged in the hands-only CPR demonstrations to underscore its life-saving potential.PRC Chairman and CEO Richard Gordon emphasized that while CPR is crucial, it is just one facet of a comprehensive first-aid training. With over 900,000 individuals already trained by the PRC in CPR, Gordon stressed the necessity of equipping every citizen with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to effectively respond to medical emergencies.“Our vision is a future where every community, every household, and every citizen is trained for first aid, so each one of us is prepared to save someone’s life.” Gordon said.Cardiac arrest remains a pressing health concern in the Philippines, claiming thousands of lives annually. Alarmingly, only one percent of victims receive the urgent medical attention required within the critical first minutes of cardiac arrest. Gordon reiterated that timely intervention, especially through CPR, significantly improves survival rates.Administered promptly, CPR can double or even triple a person’s chances of survival, highlighting its critical role beyond a medical procedure—it is a life-saving skill accessible to all. Gordon commended President Marcos for acknowledging the need to instill and continuously promote health consciousness among Filipinos by equipping them with the necessary information, knowledge, behavior, and skills to respond to health emergencies. The Red Cross reaffirms its commitment to expanding not just CPR education, but First Aid Trainings nationwide towards a CPR-ready Philippines, where knowledge and skills save lives.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/07/25/1-in-3-pinoy-children-stunted-says-study-poor-investment-in-quality-childcare-services-blamed/,"1 in 3 Pinoy children stunted, says study; poor investment in quality childcare services blamed","Government think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) recently issued a bleak scenario, saying that one in three Filipino children are stunted due to severe underinvestment and insufficient access to high quality childcare servicesIn its study “Behind the Slow Start: An Assessment of Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) in the Philippines” authored by Valerie Gilbert T. Ulep, Lyle Daryll D. Casas, Aaron Carols G. Manuel, John Paulo D. Mendoza, Joy Bagas, and Kim Leonard G. Dela Luna observed that inadequate and untimely access to high-quality early childcare and prenatal interventions were factors that pushed the alarming levels of stunting among Filipino children. Furthermore, the study also found that the severe underinvestment for early childhood care and development, weak institutions, and fragmented governance also become stumbling blocks in the implementation of early childhood care development interventions. The study was published in support of the Second Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM 2). “EDCOM 2 welcomes the findings of the study conducted by PIDS. Our recommendations on the programmatic and legislative reforms to our education systems are based on empirical evidence from these kinds of studies,” said EDCOM 2 Executive Director Karol Mark Yee. The authors pointed out that participation in early education among Filipino children aged three to four years old is low, despite the implementation of legislations such as the Kindergarten Education Act, the Enhanced Basic Education Act, and the Early Years Act. “There was a drastic decline in the percentage of children aged three to four years old attending school during the pandemic. While it recovered to 20 percent in 2022, it still fell below pre-pandemic levels,” according to the authors.The study also explained how child health outcomes are impacted by maternal and child undernutrition and exposure to infections, which directly contributes to chronic malnutrition and increased risk of mortality. According to the authors, roughly 14 percent of Filipino women of reproductive age are undernourished and evidence proves that malnourished mothers have a high possibility of giving birth to infants with low birth weights, resulting in both short term and long-term consequences. Furthermore, the authors said access to most basic health services including prenatal care, child immunization, postnatal care and other maternal and child services are quite far from the target of universal coverage. Results of the study also show that only one out of four Filipino children meet the recommended energy intake (REI). This shows the pertinacious challenges in addressing nutritional needs of children, especially among those aged six to months from low income households. By using the REI, the preliminary analysis shows no difference in terms of meeting total energy and protein intake between children who received supplementary feeding programs compared to those who did not, even after adjusting for selection bias. This finding recommends further investigation and potential adjustments to the program to ensure effectiveness in addressing the nutritional needs of children. According to the 2022 Annual Poverty Indicator, only 23 percent of children benefited from school-based feeding programs. “Despite government efforts, access remains limited. We observe a higher percentage of children aged four years old receiving government feeding programs, which reflects the implementation of school feeding initiatives in daycare centers and kindergarten schools,” said Ulep, PIDS Senior Research Fellow. To improve participation rates in early education and access to essential health and nutrition services, the study recommends the roll out of innovative financing mechanisms such as piloting public-private partnership models and investing in science-based behavioral change communication campaigns and strategies to effectively reach and engage target audience. Another general observation of the study is the hard underinvestment in ECCD, further aggravated by the prioritization of services with limited effects on nutrition and education outcomes. “Overall, the current supply of capital investments for ECCD in the country falls short of meeting the goal of universal access for children aged three to 34 to ECCD services. The country’s current facilities are insufficient by around 33,000 to meet the 96,000 daycare/child development centers required to meet 100 percent of the demand,” the report reads. Based on the authors’ findings, it was learned that the government allocates only P3,870 per child for health, significantly below the average government spending per person on health in lower- middle-income countries, which is $150.“We acknowledge the benefits of school feeding programs, but we need to start investing more deeply, and intervening, in the earlier years,” said Yee.Moreover, the authors recommend increasing public spending on ECCD and investing resources in services that would dramatically affect health, nutrition, and early education outcomes by strategically allocating resources to influence ECCD spending of local governments, investing in primary health care through the implementation of the Universal Health Care Act, reevaluating the implementation framework of government led school feeding programs, and increasing the investment in health care workers to enhance their capacity to monitor mothers and children.Rizal Raoul S.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/07/25/un-says-nearly-40-million-people-had-hiv-in-2023/,UN says nearly 40 million people had HIV in 2023,"By Edith M. Lederer, APNearly 40 million people were living with the HIV virus that causes AIDS last year, over nine million weren’t getting any treatment, and the result was that every minute someone died of AIDS-related causes, the United Nations said in a new report launched July 22, 2024.While advances are being made to end the global AIDS pandemic, the report said progress has slowed, funding is shrinking, and new infections are rising in three regions: the Middle East and North Africa, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America.In 2023, around 630,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses, a significant decline from the 2.1 million deaths in 2004. But the latest figure is more than double the target for 2025 of fewer than 250,000 deaths, according to the report by UNAIDS, the UN agency leading the global effort to end the pandemic.Gender inequality is exacerbating the risks for girls and women, the report said, citing the extraordinarily high incidence of HIV among adolescents and young women in parts of Africa.The proportion of new infections globally among marginalized communities that face stigma and discrimination—sex workers, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs also increased to 55 percent in 2023 from 45 percent in 2010, it said.UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said: “World leaders pledged to end the AIDS pandemic as a public health threat by 2030, and they can uphold their promise, but only if they ensure that the HIV response has the resources it needs, and that the human rights of everyone are protected.”As part of that pledge, leaders vowed to reduce annual new HIV infections to below 370,000 by 2025, but the report said in 2023 new infections were more than three times higher at 1.3 million.Last year, among the 39.9 million people globally living with HIV, 86 percent knew they were infected, 77 percent were accessing treatment, and for 72 percent the virus was suppressed, the report saidCésar Núñez, director of the UNAIDS New York office, told a news conference there has been progress in HIV treatments. Injections that can stay in the body for six months, but the two doses cost $40,000 yearly, out of reach for all but the richest people with the virus.He said UNAIDS has been asking the manufacturer to make it available at lower cost to low and middle-income countries.Núñez said there have also been seven cases where people with HIV who were treated for leukemia emerged with no sign of the HIV virus in their system.He said injections and the seven cases will be discussed at the 25th International AIDS Conference which began July 22 in Munich.At present, he said, daily treatment with pills costs about $75 per person per year. It has allowed many countries to increase the number of people with HIV to receive treatment.Núñez said UNAIDS will continue advocating for a vaccine to prevent AIDS. Image credits:"

Starting this academic year 2024-2025, FEU Manila will offer a Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics and a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy, while FEU Cavite will introduce a Bachelor of Science in Nursing.According to the Department of Health, the Philippines currently lacks around 190,000 healthcare professionals.“Addressing the gaps in our healthcare industry requires the collaboration of many relevant stakeholders. FEU wants to do its part by equipping more future healthcare professionals with practical skills and global perspectives that will enable them to address various healthcare challenges effectively,” says Moira Uy, Dean of Nursing at FEU’s Institute of Health Sciences and Nursing.With an aspiration to position Philippine healthcare education in the global landscape, FEU achieved a significant milestone through its international branch campus in Brunei, JPMC College of Health Sciences. This pioneering endeavor makes FEU the first Philippine university to receive a transnational permit for nursing from the Commission on Higher Education.“FEU actively participates in the goals of the Transnational Higher Education Act by facilitating the exchange of information, personnel, and academic programs. This joint venture promotes innovation and collaboration, positioning FEU as a competitive force in nursing education on a global scale,” added Uy.Recent accomplishments highlight FEU’s status as a top-tier healthcare education provider. In the most recent Philippine Nurse Licensure Examination, FEU Manila ranked as the third-best performing school with a 91.84 percent passing rate. FEU also performed well in recent Medical Technology Licensure Examination with 92.86 percent passing rate for first time examinees.FEU’s continued investment in healthcare education, both locally and globally, aligns with its commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being.“FEU shall serve as principal instrument for generating nursing knowledge, innovation, and technology to develop relevant and technical higher order skills needed to compete in the international knowledge economy. FEU has been and still is actively making its contribution in quality healthcare resource generation,” said Uy."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/07/25/philhealth-digitalization-on-track-2/,PhilHealth digitalization on track,"In a bid to make services truly accessible and within reach by as many Filipinos as possible, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) introduced another innovation in the field of digital transformation system through its new ePhilHealth platform.The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) and PhilHealth co-developed and launched ePhilHealth platform, an integration platform that plays a crucial role in PhilHealth’s digital transformation to support streamlining of government processes. This platform aims to gradually move all PhilHealth legacy systems into new and secure systems through the establishment of a National Health Data Repository (NHDR) and integration with the DICT’s eGovernment Data Exchange Platform (eGovDX). New features such as members profiles, beneficiaries, contributions, claims history, and eKonsulta registration were successfully launched to allow members to enjoy PhilHealth services at ease, even from the comfort of their homes.“Digitalization plays an important role in efficient government service delivery for our members. I assure everyone that PhilHealth will continuously enhance, update, and expand its digital solutions and innovations for the benefit of our members who are increasingly getting digital,” PhilHealth President and CEO Emmanuel R. Ledesma, Jr. said.The initiative is in line with the aggressive digitalization program of the government that aims to improve member experience as mandated by Republic Act No. 11032 or the Ease of Doing Business Law and as directed by President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. to accelerate digitalization initiatives to improve public service delivery.Being one of the first agencies to integrate in eGovPH Super App and Digital National ID, PhilHealth assures the public that more responsive and client-centric health insurance services are expected. Successful integration of the new PhilHealth Platform to the National ID eVerify also streamlined and secured members verification and identity.The new eKonsulta Registration will allow users to register to any Konsulta Package Provider nationwide.Through the eGovPH Super App, members can now check their members profiles and beneficiaries; contributions and payment history; access and manage their health insurance details including policy information and coverage; including claims history.Before the end of the year, more exciting features will be added to the new platform as PhilHealth journeys towards its digital transformation.Ledesma appealed to the members to start using the eGovPH app as part of the Agency’s commitment to deliver strategic nationwide digitalization for the benefit of Filipino citizens. “Let us continue to work hand in hand to deliver the promise of a digitally empowered nation. Together, we can build a future where public service is synonymous with excellence, efficiency, and empathy”, the PhilHealth Chief added."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/07/25/specialists-say-there-are-benefits-to-couples-sleeping-separately/,Specialists say there are benefits to couples sleeping separately,"By Leanne Italie, APMichael Solender and his wife have been together for 42 years. They slept in the same bed for the first 10, taking to separate rooms after that.Their sleep separation was due to his developing chronic and heavy snoring that eventually led to a diagnosis of sleep apnea and his use of a CPAP machine.After the machine eliminated his snoring, they continue to sleep apart in their Charlotte, North Carolina, home because of other issues. He’s typically warm at night and she’s usually cold.“For us to maintain separate rooms for sleep just makes for a healthier relationship and a better relationship,” said Solender, 66. “There’s no shame attached to that. There’s no stigma.”Snoring, temperature variations, cover stealers, and tossing and turning often lead to partners sleeping separately. Other issues are also in play, including illness, different work shifts, and partners who go to bed and get up at different times.More than one-third of Americans said they occasionally or consistently sleep in another room to accommodate a bed partner, according to an American Academy of Sleep Medicine study last year. Men are the ones who usually hit the sofa or guest room.And, perhaps surprisingly, it’s millennials who do it most, rather than older people.Dr. Seema Khosla, a pulmonologist and spokesperson for the academy, said achieving adequate sleep, which is usually seven to eight hours for adults, is important for healthy relationships.Studies indicate that people who consistently experience poor sleep are more likely to experience conflict with their partners, said Khosla, who is the medical director of the North Dakota Center for Sleep, in Fargo.“It’s really a question of people prioritizing their sleep,” Khosla said. “I have had patients who have been married like 60 years and they swear that separate bedrooms is a reason.”Sleeping separately, she said, “is probably more common than we think.”The same goes for sleep apnea, a leading cause of heavy snoring, Khosla said. Solender said he went to a sleep specialist after realizing the impact sleep deprivation had on himself and his wife.“I would wake her up and would wake myself up,” he said. “I never knew I had sleep apnea. I would say close to 20 years ago, I started falling asleep at red lights. I started falling asleep watching TV or sitting up and reading a book. I felt tired constantly. That’s when I knew I had an issue.”The key to making separate sleep spaces work is talking about it beforehand, as Solender did with his wife.“It’s not about avoiding intimacy. It’s about recognizing that you can have intimacy, you can have that time together, but then you just sleep apart. That’s a really important part of the conversation. Both partners need to understand and agree,” Khosla said.She has seen some reluctance among her patients when she suggests sleeping apart.“Usually it’s somebody’s spouse who is snoring or someone who has a spouse’s alarm that wakes them up at four in the morning or something like that. We’ll talk about it. And people will push back right away saying, oh, no, no, that’s not gonna work for me,” she said.Some, Khosla said, “will sit with it for a minute and they’ll think about it, and you can tell that they’re kind of like, I would love to do this but how do I tell my partner?”Tracey Daniels and her husband have been sleeping apart for about four years. Initially, there was no big talk. She just headed to the guest room.“It started because my husband is a horrible snorer. But also I’m a very light sleeper. He could drop a paperclip on a carpeted floor and I would wake up,” said Daniels, who lives in Tryon, North Carolina.Later, she said, she initiated a conversation after she was diagnosed with breast cancer and went through surgery.“He comes and tucks me in and gives me a kiss,” Daniels said.They rotate their three dogs at night.Dr. Phyllis Zee, chief of sleep medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and director of a sleep clinic at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said sleep separation is common in her practice.“It would be a great idea to discuss sleep compatibility before you get married. I tend to see it when couples have been married and/or they’ve been together for some time and have been trying to negotiate this for a while,” she said.Come middle age, Zee said, sleep is less robust.“In general, you’re more prone to getting things like insomnia or sleep apnea. And so that begins to be bothersome,” she said.While there’s no shame in sleeping apart, Zee said technology has helped make sharing a bed easier in some ways. White noise machines, cooling pillows and bedding, mattresses with dual temperature controls and dual control electric blankets can help, Zee said. Some couples have given up sharing blankets, using their own, to make sleep easier.“There’s a whole market out there to mitigate some of these issues,” she said.Sleep separation is more accepted now as people have become more aware of the importance of quality sleep to overall health, Zee said.“On the other hand, there is research to show there are benefits to sleeping together,” she said. “In general, probably the top line is seek professional help before making a decision. Are the issues a sign of a sleep disorder that one can treat?”"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/07/25/cpd-echoes-recent-world-bank-findings-to-invest-in-early-formative-years/,CPD echoes recent World Bank findings to invest in early formative years,"The Commission on Population and Development (CPD) acknowledges the recent findings from the Human Capital Review (HCR) of the World Bank emphasizing the need to invest in early formative years to accelerate socioeconomic growth potential from its huge labor force.With the country’s working age population comprising 63.9 percent of its total population, the Philippines is poised to harness this advantage and fully utilize the human capital potential of the country.Yet the human capital in the country is still underutilized, the World Bank states, that a Filipino child born today will only reach 52 percent of her/his potential productivity compared to a child provided with full health and good quality education. According to Undersecretary for Population and Development (POPDEV) Lisa Grace S. Bersales Ph.D., the report validates the importance of investing in human capital, which is a key strategy spelled-out in the Philippine Population and Development Plan of Action or PPD-POA 2023-2028, approved by Pres. Marcos via Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 40 on November 14, 2023 as a blueprint for interagency collaboration to optimize demographic opportunities and address prevailing population issues to accelerate socioeconomic development in the country.As defined by the World Bank, human capital refers to the “knowledge, skills, health, and experience that people accumulate throughout their lives.”Bersales, who is also CPD’s executive director, echoed the HCR’s results which showed that the Philippines is projected to achieve upper-middle-income country status by 2026 due to a significant increase in gross national income (GNI). She cautioned, however, that “despite the upward trajectory of GNI per capita, the country is currently utilizing less than half of its human capital potential.”“Based on the World Bank Report, the Philippines has the lowest Human Capital Index (HCI), among its neighboring countries, highlighting significant limitations to the productivity potential of future workers due to poor conditions or outcomes in health, education, and employment” the POPDEV undersecretary pointed out. “As of 2020, the Philippines’ HCI stands at 0.52, indicating that a child born today can only achieve slightly over half of their potential productivity by the age of 18.”Bersales expressed alignment of the recommendations of the HCR with the PPD-POA strategic actions. In optimizing demographic dividend, the PPD-POA called for the (1) urgent actions to improve investments for human capital development; (2) improved utilization of its labor force through creation of more job and economic opportunities (i.e., particularly the improvement of youth employment), (2) implementing a life cycle approach to human capital development emphasizing the strategic importance of investing for early years development; and (3) improving governance at all levels.The Undersecretary for Population and Development emphasized that the demographic opportunity created by increasing the working age population is too narrow, such that delay in needed actions may cause us to miss such opportunity . “The Philippines may be the last Asian country to benefit from demographic dividend. If we would not be able to urgently create the preconditions and prerequisites for demographic dividend within around four to five decades, which has already commenced, we may possibly miss out on such opportunity.”“Investing in our people means putting them in our minds as we develop plans and policies,” she explained. “It is crucial that we ensure Filipinos will acquire and cultivate adequate human capital, equipped with the tools necessary to enhance productivity, innovate, and capitalize on opportunities presented by new technologies.”Moreover, reiterating the recommendations of World Bank, Bersales is also calling the local government units to intensify and strengthen their initiatives in building the capacities of their human capital. The CPD official also underscored the need to address increasing adolescent pregnancies especially among young girls aged 10 to 14 years as it seriously threatens the wellbeing and capacities of young people as the foundation of the future human resource.She emphasized that “as CPD pursues its mandate to enable institutions toward people centered development, ultimately, the goal is to empower the important asset of the nation—its human capital—toward developed families, communities and country.”"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/07/25/too-many-pills-how-to-talk-to-your-doctor-about-reviewing-whats-needed/,Too many pills? How to talk to your doctor about reviewing what’s needed,"By Carla K. Johnson, APSwallowing a handful of pills is a daily ritual for many people, from young adults coping with to older adults managing . Overall, 13 percent of people in the United States take five or more prescription drugs. For those 65 and older, that number is 42 percent.If you’re taking multiple meds, it’s smart to be aware of potential problems. One pill can lead to a side effect, leading to another pill and another side effect in what experts call a “prescribing cascade.”Some drugs can cause harm if taken for years. Others stop working or interact badly with a new drug. A drug tolerated well at first can cause side effects later, leading to cognitive decline and injuries from falls.“Our metabolism changes as we get older,” said Dr. Elizabeth Bayliss, who studies deprescribing at Kaiser Permanente’s Institute for Health Research in Aurora, Colorado. “Everyone’s ability to metabolize the medications they’ve been taking for a long time may change.”The nonprofit Lown Institute calls the whole situation a that will cause 4.6 million hospital visits this decade.If your daily pill routine is getting out of hand, ask for a medication review. Here’s how to get started with a process called “deprescribing.”Start with a professional you trust, like a doctor or pharmacist, said Lisa McCarthy, a pharmacist and deprescribing expert at the University of Toronto.If you’re asking your doctor, don’t wait until the end of a 15-minute visit. Instead, make a dedicated appointment and tell them when booking you want to talk about your medicines, McCarthy said.Your doctor may not have the full picture of what you’re taking if other prescribers are involved, and some doctors hesitate to manage drugs prescribed by others. That’s when a pharmacist can help by reviewing everything and writing up suggestions you can share with your doctors, said pharmacist Bradley Phillips of the University of Florida College of Pharmacy.“We’re considered the medication experts,” Phillips said.Swelling, incontinence, restlessness, insomnia—all are side effects caused by common medications that sometimes get treated with new drugs. McCarthy wants people to ask their doctors a simple question: Could this symptom be related to one of my medications?“If we could teach the public to ask that question it would be very powerful,” McCarthy said. And for a follow-up question, she suggested: Do I still need this medicine?Pharmacist Barbara Farrell sees dramatic changes in many people she helps at an outpatient geriatric center in Ottawa, Ontario. Some have emerged from a drug-induced dementia after their meds are reduced. was able to leave her wheelchair and walk with a cane after cutting her daily pills from 32 to 17. She had arrived sedated and unable to communicate, and a few months later, she was back to her hobby of knitting.Some meds can be stopped abruptly but others require a slow taper to prevent uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms or even life-threatening seizures. Tapering to progressively lower doses is particularly important with drugs for depression, insomnia and anxiety.After two decades on various pills for these conditions, therapist Molly Bernardi of Spokane, Washington, began tapering down her doses.The 45-year-old suspected the pills were the cause of her worsening problems with digestion, balance, memory, stiff muscles and flickering dots across her field of vision. When scans ruled out other illnesses, she gradually stopped each of four medications.“It’s been by far the hardest thing I’ve ever done,” Bernardi said.One of the final drugs she stopped was the toughest: a benzodiazepine, a class of sedatives that can be harmful if taken long term. Over the course of three months, she used a kitchen knife and a nail file to cut her 1 milligram daily pill into ever-smaller pieces.She listened to her body, found support groups on Facebook and used breathwork and prayer to get through withdrawal symptoms.“Now when I have a good day, a good hour, a good moment, it’s peace and presence like I’ve never known since before I was medicated,” Bernardi said. “I’m just experiencing a little bit of great. And a little bit of great is so great that it keeps me going.”Even in the best-connected health care systems, McCarthy said, information about prescriptions isn’t always shared among doctors. And they won’t know about your over-the-counter drugs, vitamins or nightly CBD gummy.The only person who knows everything you take is you, McCarthy said. So keep a current list of what you take, why it was prescribed and when you started taking it.Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/07/25/three-men-no-regrets-vasectomy-was-the-best-decision-for-my-family/,Three men: ‘No regrets! Vasectomy was the best decision for my family’,"Three men had vasectomy in the last eight weeks, in the wake of the May 8, 2024 launch of the SODEX (Service Outreach and Distribution Extension Program) Mobile Clinic run by DKT Philippines Foundation and made possible by TRUST Reproductive Health Choices. Ron Domingo, Keith Reyes, and Azell Cagampan were all looking to get non-scalpel vasectomy when the mobile clinic landed near their respective homes.They all went through the process of receiving the free permanent contraception procedure and were all individually interviewed about why they decided to get it and how it is changing their family life for the better.All three (two millennials and one zoomer) have already been planning to get a vasectomy and have been looking for a safe way to get it. All of them have decided they already have the right number of children, with Azell having six, Ron having four, and Keith having one.They all saw how their wives suffered during their pregnancies, even more so during childbirth. Ron explained, “My wife miscarried twice, and this took an emotional toll on both of us. We have four kids already and that’s enough for me and my wife to raise them properly. Also, I do not want further complications for my wife who is already 45 years old.”Keith’s ordeal is no less difficult. This working student witnessed how much his young wife, also a student, struggled while pregnant. Their backbreaking experience during those difficult months dealing with their parents, their classes, and work led them to consider vasectomy as the right option and to stop having more babies in the future. “I got a vasectomy for my partner. We’re focused on raising our firstborn who’s one year and eight months old now,” Keith definitively asserted.Azell has been researching vasectomy since 2023 and it was only this June, by chance, that the traveling SODEX Mobile Clinic stopped by in Moncada (Tarlac), near his residence. Because Azell and his wife are okay with having six children, they both trooped to the site. After a 30-minute consultation with the healthcare staff, Azell had his procedure which took only 20 minutes. “Sobrang bilis,” (real fast) he exclaimed. Ron said that after two days, he was able to go back to work since he didn’t feel uncomfortable anymore. He swears it is a safe procedure and is better than spending more on other forms of contraceptives.Contrary to the common misgivings among men, vasectomy does not affect one’s manhood or sexuality. Keith observed that most men do not get a vasectomy for this reason, fearing that their masculinity will be “on the line”.The SODEX Mobile Clinic offers free non-scalpel vasectomy, which is as effective as conventional vasectomy, while also being less invasive and having a shorter recovery time. It is one of the best contraceptive methods due to it being permanent, having 99.9% success rate, and being easier on the body compared to ligation (a procedure for women).Consultations and briefings are being given to all those who go to the SODEX Mobile Clinic for vasectomy. The counseling includes information about the procedure, what to expect before and after the procedure, and post-procedure care.The mobile clinic is led by Dr. Luis Garcia who specializes in voluntary surgical contraception and has 20 years of experience under his belt. He said, “We’ve visited seven provinces in Luzon, so far, having tended to 34 vasectomy patients. Vasectomy is a very minor procedure; we give anesthesia to dull the pain. Patients can go back to work and regular activities after a day or two. No nerves or blood vessels that affect erection are touched, and testicles are still intact after the procedure. So, to the men out there, macho pa rin kayo (you’re as macho as ever). Remember this, vasectomy is an act of love for your wife and your family. It is responsible family planning.”All three men swear that vasectomy also helped them become more intimate with their partners. “There is more bonding between us, and it even increased my own sense of sensuality,” Azell revealed.For Ron, vasectomy will help a family, since it will empower parents to better care for their children. Drawing from his own experience growing up, he quipped that in large families, it can happen that parents will forget the names of some of their children and will not have enough resources to care for them.The SODEX Mobile Clinic will travel around Luzon this year and will be offering free non-scalpel vasectomy to men among other services. The clinic will stay in one area for a maximum of two days from 8 am to 6 pm.By next year, the mobile clinic will cover communities in the Visayas and Mindanao areas."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/07/25/handwashing-best-way-to-beat-hand-foot-mouth-disease-health-expert/,"Handwashing best way to beat hand, foot, mouth disease–health expert","Frequent and proper handwashing with soap and water prevent the transmission of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), a health expert said recently.“We teach children to wash their hands after using the toilet, especially before eating. In fact, in a study in China, nakita nila na (they saw that) handwashing is an effective way to prevent HFMD outbreak,” University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital Community Dermatology Vice Chair Maria Christina Filomena Batac said in a media forum.HFMD is a mild and contagious infection caused by human enteroviruses species A and enterovirus 71.It is common among children 10 years old and below manifesting as vesicles or blisters on palms, soles, tongue, and buttocks.Adults also acquire HFMD but they may have no or very few blisters.Prior to the eruption of blisters, which takes seven to 10 days, infected children and adults may experience low grade fever, malaise, abdominal pain, cough colds and sore throat for one to two days.“Hand-foot-mouth disease can be seen in countries where weather changes every summer or autumn,” Batac said.“Hand-foot-mouth disease is only from humans, this is not from animals, this is not similar to the foot and mouth disease affecting cows, pigs, sheep, and goats,” she added.It can be spread through fecal-oral transmission and respiratory inhalation.Symptoms may take three to six days to show once a person is exposed to an HFMD patient.The patient is contagious for five weeks because the virus can still be present in the feces from four to eight weeks, and for two weeks in throat secretions.Batac said children younger than six years old sometimes develops onychomadesis or loss of nail, one to two months after HFMD.She said some cases lead to severe neurologic disease like encephalities, encephalomyelitis, and polio-like syndromes; and other complications like myocarditis, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage and death.There are no antibiotics and no antivirals for HFMD. It can only be managed through supportive treatment including medicine for fever and pain, hydration, proper nutrition, and sleep and rest.In addition to handwashing, parents, guardians and carers are advised to disinfect commonly touched surfaces and toys to prevent HFMD transmission."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/07/25/empower-yourself-essential-tips-for-a-mothers-pursuit-of-health-and-wellness/,Empower yourself! Essential tips for a mother’s pursuit of health and wellness,"Intensive mothering, a term coined by sociologist Sharon Hays, refers to a cultural norm and set of expectations emphasizing the idea that mothers devote a significant amount of their time, energy, and resources for their child’s upbringing. The concept of intensive mothering, where public opinion influences the “right way” to be a mother, describes mothers as the primary and preferred caregivers by default, leaving little to no time for themselves. “It is a common thing for mothers to deprioritize self-care during their pregnancy and even after delivery,” said Dr. Emerita Rilloraza, an OB-Gyne from Manila Doctors Hospital. “Mothers often feel the need to put their healthcare on hold to focus on others”. While this may be true for some people, this should not be the norm. During a forum for expectant mothers, Dr. Rilloraza enumerated the major milestones and changes during pregnancy and early stages of motherhood. To help mothers of all ages, Rilloraza offered significant health advice to help guide mothers and moms-to-be on their journey to motherhood. “During your pregnancy, your body changes, as well as your outlook in everything so it’s important to have the support of your loved ones”. Rilloraza added. During pregnancy, it is crucial to pay attention to health issues that may arise. These include pregnancy-related diabetes or high blood pressure and other complications. To prevent those, the doctor advised women to be wary of their daily food and fluid intake.“Pregnant women should be getting enough nutrition during their pregnancy as it supports fetal growth and development, reduces the risk of complications, supports lactation, and maintains the mother’s health”, the OB-Gyne said. Apart from nutrition, moms-to-be should also be getting proper sleep, avoiding alcohol and tobacco, practicing yoga and meditation, and keeping themselves stress-free. “Social connection is very significant during this life stage. Having a supportive social network—be it with your family, friends, and community is essential to maintain your overall well-being”, she added. While certain body changes are inevitable, expectant mothers should know the danger signs if they have high-risk pregnancies. According to Dr. Rilloraza, certain factors may add to a more complicated pregnancy.Pregnant women are more prone to having high-risk pregnancies if they belong in the young primigravid (age less than 17 years), old primigravid (age more than 35 years), and grandmultiparity (with five or more children) groups. Additionally, women may have more high-risk pregnancies if they have poor OB history, hypertension, diabetes, bronchial asthma, heart disease, thyroid disorders, renal disease, with malignancies like cancer, had multiple pregnancies, and with previous C-section delivery. After delivery, care is as crucial as the early stages of pregnancy as it requires critical attention to ensure the health of the mother and child. Most new moms also experience postpartum baby blues after childbirth, which can range from having mood swings, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping. This usually begins within the first two to three days after delivery and may last for up to two weeks.However, when a new mom experiences a more severe, long-lasting form of postpartum baby blues, it can be considered already as postpartum depression or peripartum depression (if it started during pregnancy and continues until childbirth). Most common symptoms of postpartum depression are severe mood swings, attention withdrawal, difficulty bonding with the child, intense irritability and anger, severe anxiety and panic attacks, overwhelming tiredness, and recurring thoughts of harm and death. “If you have any of these symptoms after childbirth, it is best to seek immediate medical care from your healthcare provider or your OB-Gyne”, Rilloraza added. Many people struggle with making time for themselves, especially with new moms after childbirth. Dr. Rilloraza emphasized the need for self-care for both the mom and child’s well-being. “Self-care doesn’t have to be expensive. You just need to find the right balance in parenting your child and taking care of yourself too.”From getting more sleep, meeting with friends, decluttering your home to doing and learning new hobbies, self-care positively impacts one’s mental, physical, emotional, spiritual, and social health. “Learning to prioritize yourself amidst your life as a mom also has its health benefits. It reduces your risks of future medical issues such as heart disease. Caring for yourself is often the first step to caring for others,” she said.As the old saying goes, you cannot pour from an empty cup. It is important to also prioritize yourself so you can provide the best possible care for your baby and your family.

Besides having the financial means to cover the medical and other modalities of treatment, it also requires the physical, mental, emotional and psychological strengths of the family or caretakers to attend to them especially when needed. As a show of support to families rearing children with disabilities, the Muntinlupa City Government has formed a dedicated support group for parents. This monthly gathering provides a safe and healthy space for parents to share their experiences, gain insights, and find encouragement from one another.For Jhen, a mother of a child with special needs, the support group has been a lifeline for parents like them. “ (We’ve found a new family here who understands and supports our journey),” she said. “The sharing sessions with fellow parents are a source of inspiration and practical ideas for our children.”Another parent named Dan could not agree more with her.” (This support group has been a tremendous relief for my wife and me. It allows us to open up about the challenges we face and find solace in knowing we’re not alone),” he said.MAYOR Ruffy Biazon’s pioneering program called Project AGAP (Agarang Gabay at Alalay na Pambata) is aimed at the early detection and intervention of developmental delays in children. Through this initiative, children with special needs receive free assessments and therapy sessions from developmental-behavioral pediatricians, guaranteeing timely support and care for them.The support group was established as an extension Project AGAP. It underscores more the commitment of the local government unit of Muntinlupa to fostering an inclusive community that embraces and supports all its members, regardless of their abilities.“This initiative highlights our unwavering dedication to the well-being of every family in Muntinlupa,” the local chief executive said. “We believe that every child deserves the opportunity to thrive, and we are committed to providing the resources and support they need to reach their full potential.”Since its inception, the support group has already made a great impact on the lives of parent-participants, offering a much-needed sense of community and empowerment. “This program has given us hope and strength to continue advocating for our children,” Jhen said.The LGU of Muntinlupa is dedicated to provide its residents with a high quality of life, ensuring their safety, well-being, and progress. With its different programs, the city strives to create an inclusive and sustainable community where everyone can thrive.Roderick L.

At Tzu Chi Foundation’s Charity Run for Education on July 21 at the University of the Philippines (UP) in Diliman, Quezon City, your participation in the 1K, 3K, 5K, or 10K category will help sustain the education of 1,700 elementary, high school, and college scholars currently under Tzu Chi’s Educational Assistance Program. The program itself, a balance of academics and values formation through Humanity classes and community service, is life-changing. The daughter of a single mother who sold kwek kwek and paper bags, Cherrie Rose Ang was a working student who contributed to the family’s income by tutoring, working as a market vendor, and selling breakfast to her dormmates. Her goal then? “To be rich,” she says.A Tzu Chi scholarship, from her third year in high school at Northern Rizal Yorklin School in Caloocan to her college years as a philosophy major in UP Los Baños, covered more than tuition and allowances. It gave the quiet and shy girl opportunities to shine in Tzu Chi events she was encouraged to host. It also gave her direction—and a new goal. Through the foundation’s livelihood and outreach programs she attended as a member of Tzu Chi Youth, Ang developed an interest in counseling. These days, the OIC for Tzu Chi’s Volunteer Development and Mission Support Department is a mental health responder in two clinics. She’s also close to finishing her master’s in clinical psychology at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. “If I did not come to Tzu Chi, I wouldn’t be able to see the importance of helping people,” she says. “And I wouldn’t be able to see that even if you don’t have money, you can still do something.”Ang’s realization echoes a constant reminder from Tzu Chi founder, Buddhist nun Dharma Master Cheng Yen. “Giving is not the privilege of the rich,” she said, “it is the privilege of the sincere.” She certainly proved it nearly 60 years ago when she founded Tzu (“compassion”) Chi (“relief”) with 30 housewives in a poor community in Taiwan. To raise money for their charitable causes, she asked the housewives to set aside TWD 50 cents daily in bamboo coin banks. This “spirit of the bamboo bank” would be replicated countless times over by volunteers and beneficiaries in 68 countries. The humble and selfless act has funded Tzu Chi’s missions in disaster relief, medical assistance, education assistance, and more in over 136 countries.Tzu Chi Philippines was established in 1994, its mission of education a year after. Thanks to volunteers’ tireless efforts at extending quality education to poor but deserving youth, the foundation has awarded 13,000 scholarships to students in Zamboanga, Davao, Leyte, Cebu, Bohol, Iloilo, Pampanga, Bicol, and the National Capital Region.Giveaways from Tzu Chi’s Charity Run for Education reflect the foundation’s advocacy for environmental protection. All runners will receive loot bags, shirts (for 1K runners), and singlets (for those joining the 3K, 5K, and 10K categories) made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET), material processed from single-use plastic bottles. Each participant will also receive a reusable hydration cup made from the agricultural waste wheat straw. All runners who cross the finish line will each receive a finisher’s medal.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/07/02/legislator-urged-immediate-review-of-universal-healthcare-law-htac-powers-in-healthcare-agenda/,"Legislator urged immediate review of Universal Healthcare Law, HTAC Powers in Healthcare Agenda","Iloilo’s 1st District Representative Cong. Janette Garin highlighted the need for a review of the Universal Healthcare Law and the powers of the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) to enhance healthcare access and efficiency.Garin, a physician and an expert in medical technology, public health, and vaccinology, raised the importance of revisiting the Universal Healthcare Law to address current inefficiencies and barriers to effective public healthcare. “Achieving quality healthcare relies on government spending, accountability, and partnerships. It’s crucial to work together with executive agencies, which is why the government now is actively exercising its oversight powers,” she said. Garin criticized the HTAC for its lack of urgency and the cumbersome processes that delay the approval and procurement of essential medicines and vaccines. “There is a rigorous ethical review for inclusion in the Philippine National Drug Formulary (PNDF), but this often leads to delays that are not aligned with the procurement timelines of the Department of Health (DOH),” she and other healthcare providers noted.She pointed out that while funds and medical assistance are available, the restrictive and lengthy HTAC review process hinders timely access to medications. Garin mentioned the reality of hospitals having to wait three to four years for a drug to be approved and included in the PNDF, forcing the Secretary of Health to frequently issue certificates of exemption.“Obtaining certification from social workers or barangay captains has politicized the process, contributing to reduced utilization,” Garin explained. The implementation of the Medical Assistance to Indigent Patients (MAIP) program, which was formerly the Medical Assistance Program (MAP), has also encountered obstacles. The new guidelines for classifying indigent and financially incapacitated patients, although intended to streamline access, have created additional layers of bureaucracy. For example, cervical cancer is preventable through vaccination, which is more cost-effective compared to treatment. Despite this, in the Philippines, 12 Filipinas die every day due to this disease, highlighting the urgent need for prevention and intervention measures. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women, and among women between 15 and 44 years old in the Philippines. With the current healthcare laws in place, anti-cervical cancer vaccines remain unattainable for the middle-class Filipina.She advocated for a more inclusive definition of eligible patients in the 2024 budget, aiming to address these barriers. The guidelines, published on April 16, 2024, now include the term “financially incapacitated patients” to better serve those in need.Garin further urged a formal review of the Universal Healthcare Law, especially provisions related to HTAC’s authority. She highlighted that the requirement for a vaccine or medical device to be used in other countries for 8 to 10 years before its adoption in the Philippines is detrimental to innovation and access. “This provision is anti-industry and must be taken out. It’s a waste of time and government resources, making healthcare less accessible,” she asserted.With elections approaching and the legislative session nearing its end, Garin emphasized the urgency of filing amendments to the Universal Healthcare Law before the deadline. She expressed her commitment to vocalizing these issues during House sessions and pursuing necessary legislative changes. She ends the discussion with a remark, “Formal action is needed to review the Universal Healthcare Law and the powers of HTAC. The implementation of universal healthcare, currently managed by PhilHealth, needs thorough examination.”As healthcare remains a prevalent issue for Filipinos, Garin’sinitiatives highlight the urgent need to revisit existing laws to better serve public health needs. Revisiting the Universal Healthcare Law and subsequently, the HTAC’s powers, reflects a broader effort to ensure that healthcare becomes more efficient and equitable. By addressing these systemic challenges, there is hope for a more responsive healthcare system that aligns with the evolving needs of the nation."

However, her world was abruptly shattered when she faced a life-threatening condition.One morning, as Jessica stood before her colleagues, confidently presenting her latest project, she was unexpectedly struck by intense pain coursing through her head. Simultaneously, a strange weakness began to numb one side of her body. Jessica desperately attempted to call out for assistance, but her words emerged garbled and incoherent, causing further panic and frustration.Jessica had suffered a stroke caused by a blocked blood vessel in her brain, which could otherwise have been fatal if she hadn’t been brought to the hospital immediately. The doctors attributed the stroke to a combination of factors, including Jessica’s lack of regular exercise, high-fat diet, and uncontrolled cholesterol level.Jessica is among the thousands of Filipinos who suffer heart attack and stroke. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the Philippines.High levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C or bad cholesterol) can lead to an accumulation of fatty plaques in the arteries that supply blood to the heart, lungs, and brain. Clogging of these arteries can cause heart attack and stroke. While Jessica survived her stroke, the accumulation of plaque in her arteries caused by uncontrolled bad cholesterol greatly increases her risk of a second stroke and other cardiovascular events such as a heart attack. Research shows that people who have experienced a cardiovascular event due to plaque accumulation are 6 to 9 times more likely to suffer another heart attack or stroke.To raise awareness about the risk of uncontrolled LDL-C and empower Filipinos to prevent cardiovascular events through a heart-healthy lifestyle, Novartis Healthcare Philippines together with the country’s leading cardiologists is conducting “Turning Second Chances to Lifelong Victories: The siRNA Roadshow”. Aside from diet and exercise, lowering LDL-C is key to managing and preventing cardiovascular diseases, according to Dr. Lourdes Ella Santos, preventive cardiologist, clinical lipidologist & hypertension specialist. Studies have shown that lowering LDL-C levels could prevent 75% of cardiovascular deaths worldwide.“Sustained LDL-C reduction will prevent patients from developing plaques or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD], which often lead to heart disease and stroke,” Dr. Santos said.Regular check-ups with a cardiologist and an annual lipid profile can help people stay informed about their health status and take proactive measures to prevent ASCVD.The latest international and local guidelines recommend LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL for high-risk individuals, and an even more aggressive target of below 55 mg/dL for people with a history of heart attack or stroke. The main treatment goal is to reduce bad cholesterol by at least 50% from the baseline value, even if the starting point is already relatively low.“We now know that lowering LDL-C below 50 mg/dL is safe and well tolerated. A decrease of 39 mg/dL translates to a 22% reduction in the risk of heart attack. The lower the LDL-C, the better,” said Dr. Raul Lapitan, cardiologist and echocardiographer.To minimize a patient’s risk of heart attack and stroke, cardiologists recommend the following LDL-C goals:● Low-Risk Patients = less than 116mg/dL● Moderate-Risk Patients = less than 100 mg/dL● High-Risk Patients = less than 70 mg/dL● Very High-Risk Patients = less than 55 mg/dLA new class of cholesterol-lowering treatment called small interfering RNA (siRNA) can help high-risk individuals like Jessica reduce their LDL-C.Inclisiran is the first and only LDL-C-lowering siRNA therapy that selectively targets the liver. By preventing production of the target protein, Inclisiran increases hepatic uptake of circulating LDL-C, thereby reducing LDL-C levels in the bloodstream. Inclisiran has been shown to reduce LDL-C by up to 52% with just two doses per year. This reduction in LDL-C levels further decreases the risk of heart attack and stroke, especially in people having difficulty reaching their LDL-C goal with traditional therapy. Inclisiran works best with statin therapy and is an exciting addition to proven effective therapies for LDL-C control.In January 2024, Jessica, who had been struggling to achieve the goal of less than 55 mg/dL on traditional therapy, received her first dose of Inclisiran. Her LDL-C decreased to less than 20 mg/dL, significantly reducing her risk for future cardiovascular events.Recent advancements in medical treatments have made it possible for individuals like Jessica to turn second chances to lifelong victories. By working closely with your cardiologist and taking a proactive approach to managing bad cholesterol, you can regain control over your health and live a healthier, fuller life.“The difference between an expense and an investment is an expense is taking money out of your pocket to maintain the status quo, e.g., rent. An investment is taking money out of your pocket to have a better future, e.g., buying your own home. We hope patients view controlling their LDL-C is an investment on their life; to live longer, live well, and celebrate many more birthdays with their loved ones.” said Joel Chong, Country President of Novartis Healthcare Philippines. Experts strongly recommend that people with a history of heart attack or stroke consult their doctor about the optimal LDL-C goal and ideal treatment option to optimize their health and achieve better cholesterol control.Your accumulated years of exposure to LDL-c can be used as an estimate to your plaque burden and your average risk for the first heart attack.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/30/building-a-happy-world-for-humans-animals/,"Building a happy world for humans, animals","THE recent indictment of a barangay tanod for the brutal killing of a Golden Retriever named Killua has shone light anew on current efforts to amend legislation on animal welfare, with a view to protecting both the animals and humans, amid an alarming surge in rabies cases.“The barangay tanod who killed Killua has been indicted. This means the case is now v. and the trial will soon begin,” declared the advocacy group PAWS on its Facebook page. This announcement followed the finding by Prosecutor Wilhenry M. Villar of the Provincial Prosecution Service-Iriga City, who determined probable cause against Solares, allowing him to be charged with violating the Animal Welfare Act for killing the 3-year-old Labrador-Golden Retriever.In the three-page resolution, the prosecutor, PAWS noted, had likened the Killua case to the 1855 case that US lawyer and politician George Vest argued for. He quoted: “when a neighbor killed his client’s dog, the neighbor took the life of more than just a pet—he killed an important family member.”While the Office of the Prosecutor found no probable cause for charges of dog-meat trading under the Anti-Rabies Act, Solares will be tried for his act of cruelty under the Animal Welfare Act, PAWS added.The maximum penalty for violation of the Animal Welfare Act of the Philippines is up to 3 years imprisonment and/or P250,000 if the convicted offender is a public officer or employee like Solares, a barangay tanod of Barangay Tres Reyes, Bato, Camarines Sur.“Improvement of our laws is ideal but no amount of lobbying for laws will lead to the prosecution of animal offenders if there is no criminal complaint filed by witnesses of animal abuse. PAWS is ready to support and stand by concerned citizens who take action and file these complaints,” the group said in its FB post.Just last May, senators threw their support behind timely passage of an amendatory bill that will give more teeth to the Animal Welfare Act, by slapping stiffer penalties on those who abuse them, while also engendering a whole-of-society approach to ensuring communities are safe for both animals and humans.Also last month, Health Secretary Teodoro J. Herbosa raised the alarm over the 13-percent rise in rabies cases in the first five months of 2024. In the Senate hearing on the amendatory bill filed by three senators, panel chair Cynthia Villar drew attention to the mind-boggling number of stray dogs and cats in the country, with a conservative estimate of 13 million. Such homeless animals pose a constant risk to humans, according to Sen. Grace Poe, a known animal welfare advocate, who drew attention to the Philippines’s dubious ranking as the sixth country with the highest rabies incidence.In flagging the 13-percent rise in human rabies cases from January to May this year, the DOH also reminded the public to get their pets vaccinated against rabies and to seek vaccination if they are bitten. This, after recording 169 human rabies cases from January to May this year, which is higher compared to the reported 150 cases in the same period in 2023.As of May 11, 2024, Region XII (Soccsksargen) reported the highest number of cases, with 21.This was followed by Regions IV-A (Calabarzon) and V (Bicol), with 18 cases each. Among the reported cases, 156 (92 percent) had a history of dog bites, 10 (6 percent) had a history of cat bites, and the remaining 3 cases involved bites from other animals.Of the 169 reported cases, a total of 160 deaths have been reported, resulting in a case fatality rate of 94.67 percent. The status of the remaining 9 cases reported is still being verified.“Rabies is a viral infection that can be transmitted to humans through animal bites or even scratches, most commonly by dogs and cats,” said Herbosa.That rabies is preventable, and vaccination is the most effective measure to protect animals and humans, makes the dire situation even more tragic, DOH noted.“Given the high percentage of cases involving dogs and cats, it is imperative that pet owners ensure their animals are vaccinated against rabies at 3 months old and every year thereafter. This not only protects the animals but also significantly reduces the risk of transmission to humans,” the DOH said.“Death caused by rabies is inevitable once infection begins, that’s why we urge all pet owners to be responsible and get their pets vaccinated against rabies. This not only protects the animals but also significantly reduces the risk of transmission to humans. With this, we can eradicate rabies towards our journey to a Bagong Pilipinas Bawat Buhay ay Mahalaga,” Herbosa said.In a press conference in April, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said around 22 million dogs and cats should be vaccinated against rabies in the country. He also stressed the need for a budget of at least P110 million.The DOH said it supports this call for additional DA budget allocation for the widespread animal vaccination program, but it remains uncertain if such will be reflected in the proposed 2025 budget that the Executive will present to lawmakers after July’s opening of the third and last session of the 19th Congress.To Senator Poe, everything should start with the barangays, which need to be equipped with animal welfare programs to allow them to act effectively against cruelty incidents.“An important question to ask is whether we have sufficient animal welfare programs in place and whether our communities—especially in rural areas—have adequate access to quality veterinary healthcare services,” she said.“As first responders to animals in need, it’s imperative that barangay personnel are guided by policies and have the wherewithal to act,” Poe said at the Villar-led hearing on her Senate Bill No. 2458 seeking to strengthen the Animal Welfare Act.On the national level, Poe said the responsibility of ensuring animal welfare falls under the purview of the Bureau of Animal Industry or BAI, a staff bureau of the Department of Agriculture (DA).Under Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code, she noted that the delivery of veterinary services to the communities has been devolved to local government units. However, the Local Government Code mandates that only provinces and cities should have their own veterinarian officer.“Hence, there is a reported shortage of veterinary personnel in smaller municipalities. And even cities that have veterinarians have to contend with inadequate resources,” Poe said.“Ideally, the Department of Agriculture should be able to train and deputize animal welfare enforcement officers from the communities, the police for law enforcement, and members of animal welfare organizations such as those present here today, so that issues can be immediately taken cared of at the barangay level, in an effective but humane manner,” she added.Poe’s bill aims to strengthen the DA in addressing animal welfare issues through a bureau that will be given sufficient budget and permanent personnel.The measure aims to establish standards geared towards engendering responsible pet ownership, as well as ethical behavior and accountability from all those who have control over or provide care to animals.The measure to amend the Animal Welfare Act of 1998 (amended by Republic Act 10631) is backed by Poe, and Senators Nancy Binay and Joel Villanueva. It seeks to fortify the animal provisions of the law and to create an Animal Welfare Bureau for the effective implementation and enforcement of the law.It aims to strengthen the country’s animal welfare standards, policies, rules and regulations, implementation, and enforcement.Senator Villar, whose committee conducted the last hearing, stressed that “the main problem that our country faces with regards to animals are stray, and neglect, with countless dogs and cats left to fend for themselves, often succumbing to hunger, disease, or accidents, overpopulation, the lack of education in terms of animal welfare, and responsible pet ownership.” She also pointed out “another issue is the trading and eating of dog meat.”Stray animals, said Villar, are “mainly a human health hazard, because of the spread of diseases such as rabies, leptospirosis, and other parasites,” she noted.Poe thanked Senator Villar for using her committee to hear the related concern about animal welfare, despite the pressing problems of the sector.“Despite animals’ worth and value to human society, many animals are neglected, deliberately abandoned, starved to death in animal pounds, or fall victim to animal cruelty. On the other hand, some irresponsible pet owners have permitted their unvaccinated pets to cause nuisance, fear, or harm to their communities,” Poe said in her opening statement.One major cause and effect of this maltreatment is the overpopulation of homeless animals, Poe said. According to the Mars Petcare Pet Homelessness Project report, there are a total of 13.11 million stray cats and dogs in the Philippines today.Because strays lack proper care or vaccinations, rabies is most common in countries where stray dogs are present in large numbers. The Philippines is, in fact, ranked 6th among countries with the highest rabies incidence in the world.Poe lamented that many animals are neglected, abandoned or starved to death in animal pounds, or fall victim to animal cruelty.Reacting to the Petcare Pet Homelessness Project report that there are a total of 13.11 million stray cats and dogs in the Philippines today, Poe expressed hope that her bill “can spark a discussion whose time has come.”Poe’s late father, Philippine action movie king and award-winning director Fernando Poe Jr., had often recalled the fate of his father, Fernando Poe Sr., who died of rabies at a relatively young age.The amendatory bill thus comes as a seeming circle completion of sorts for the Poes. “With the help of all stakeholders, I am sure we can come up with a law enabling the creation of a society where we can coexist harmoniously with those beings which have provided us with much love and loyalty,” Poe added.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

Upgraded facilities, renovated centers and units, and new offices reflect the hospital’s unwavering commitment to provide the “Right Care, Right Here” commitment to its patients.“This 54th anniversary of CMC is significant because we have just come from a pandemic and we were able to overcome all the challenges that we faced. Having celebrated our 54th year shows CMC’s resilience and dedication to the healthcare industry,” according to Ms. Victoria Lorelie Tan, CMC President, during the hospital’s grand anniversary celebration held recently.Dr. Jorge Logarta, CMC’s Medical Director, added, “We always strive to provide excellent patient care and throughout all challenges, as what our president said, we showed our resilience, our perseverance and our hard work in the medical industry.”CMC will soon open its doors for an expanded and renovated Emergency Complex located at Quezon Avenue corner Sct. Magbanua St. Barangay Paligsahan Quezon City. This state-of-the-art facility is dedicated to provide specialized care for trauma and all emergency cases.The newly renovated Emergency Complex is a project of the new administration under Mt. Grace Hospitals, Inc.Dr. Johnny Perez, head of the CMC Emergency Department said, “Here in CMC, our mission is to provide the highest quality emergency and urgent care for all our patients. This new facility will allow us to cater to more complex emergency cases. With our expanded capabilities, we hope to save even more lives by offering the best possible emergency care.”Spanning nearly 800 square meters, the new 30-bed Emergency Complex has resuscitation areas, a trauma section and an isolation unit for infectious cases. It also has a separate facility for pediatric care and for obstetrics and gynecological emergencies. The Emergency Department’s collaboration with the Cardiology Section allows for more immediate treatment of heart attacks.“We made sure that we can also accommodate an overflow of patients especially when there is a multiple casualty incident or we have a disaster. We can accommodate up to 60 to 65 patients but we do not wish for that kind of scenario,” he added.CMC also invested in its own advanced life support ambulance, ensuring a seamless transition of care. The ambulance team is composed of the same highly trained professionals who staff the ER.“We actually trained them for pre-hospital trauma life support. These are people who will pick up patients from their homes or wherever they are and provide immediate care even before reaching the hospital,” Dr. Perez shared.He also related that CMC is launching its new Residency Training Program in Emergency Medicine to augment the hospital’s manpower to meet the growing needs of the Emergency Department. This also will provide a valuable training ground for new doctors in the field.“Our new ER will catapult CMC to a level of excellence particularly in emergency care services,” Dr. Perez said.To elevate patient experience and provide the medical staff with an improved work environment, CMC opened the new Medical Service Offices on the 8th floor of CMC 1 Building. The office centralizes clinical departments, providing doctors with dedicated spaces for meetings and other tasks.The CMC Eye Center and the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) Center will soon move to their new and improved location on the 2nd floor of CMC 2 Building.The new Ambulatory Oncology Treatment Unit, also on the 2nd floor, was recently inaugurated. This dedicated unit provides a shift from traditional in-patient treatment, allowing stable cancer patients to receive chemotherapy, biologic therapy or support treatment on an outpatient basis.As part of the celebration of the 54th anniversary, the CMC employees gathered again to recognize the 164 service awardees for this year. The Employees’ Program with the theme “Modern Filipiniana” was held last June 14, 2024, at Elements Centris, Quezon City. The event honored employees who have reached service milestones with the hospital.Our dear President, Ms. Victoria Lorelie Tan, welcomed and congratulated all the awardees by delivering her welcome remarks. “The hospital will not function without the doctors. It will not also function without our employees. Everyone is an integral part of the hospital.”She also mentioned that the management is grateful to the doctors and employees who make a difference through exceptional patient care. Fortunately, the hospital has not been significantly affected by the nationwide nursing shortage. She continued, “We have enough nurses. We are hiring nurses as we need them. The reason is because we provide them not only with the compensation, they want but also the training they need.”The medical staff of CMC also celebrated the 54th anniversary on June 21 at Seda Vertis North, Diliman, Quezon City, with the same theme.It was a well-attended occasion, with the doctors dressed in Modern Filipiniana attire. The main event was the awarding of plaques to the medical staff for their loyalty and commitment to the institution for 25, 30, 35 and 40 years.Special awards and recognition were also given to outstanding doctors for their contributions to CMC. These doctors were Dr. Franklin P. Atencio, Dr. Lilia P. Luna, Dr. Maximino D. Elgar, Dr. Ma. Realiza G. Henson, Dr. Manuel C. Jorge, and Dr. Vergel A. Quiogue.In her message during the program, Ms. Victoria Lorelie M. Tan said that as CMC moves into the future, they are looking closely at healthcare trends and are making sure that the hospital will be able to keep up with the ever-changing health landscape. These are changing times and the hospital needs to adapt to these changes in order to remain on top of the game."

In the metro, while condominium communities undoubtedly offer convenience, security and safety, they are not necessarily able to support a holistic lifestyle that nurtures all aspects of a person—physically, mentally and socially.I-Land Residences Sucat, as a pioneering residential condominium with a deliberate commitment to a lifestyle of sustainability, is a development that addresses this need. First and foremost, as much as 60 percent of its two-hectare master plan is allocated for greenery and open spaces—creating a nature-based urban sanctuary that, by itself, already greatly contributes to the wellness of its residents by ensuring freedom of space and movement.Additionally, I-Land Residences Sucat’s amenities and facilities have been thoughtfully designed in synergy with this unique nature-rich environment to provide a genuinely balanced and holistic daily lifestyle. In terms of physical fitness, the second level of I-Land Residences Sucat’s clubhouse boasts of a gym complete with standard equipment and machines, as well as ample space for other activities such as yoga or group exercises.Other upcoming amenities enabling an active lifestyle include a full-size basketball court and a pool complex complete with showers and changing rooms. Throughout the community, residents will also be able to make use of dedicated bike lanes and meandering jogging paths, complemented by outdoor fitness stations.At I-Land Residences Sucat, intellectual pursuits are also given importance. At the ground floor of the clubhouse, families can allow their children to freely and safely spend their time playing, learning or developing new skills in their very own play area. Meanwhile, adults can work or study as well at the adjacent thinking pods. Most importantly, I-Land Residences Sucat enables and encourages meaningful social interaction. There are venues big and small that provide safe spaces for fun and recreation. At the second level of the clubhouse, a game room offers the perfect place for family and friends to unwind with a game of pool or a round of karaoke. At the third level, residents can hold their own events and gatherings in a capacious function hall that can accommodate up to 100 guests.The atmosphere of neighborliness will be further enhanced with numerous other outdoor features such as playgrounds for kids and a dedicated pet park where families can enjoy quality time with their furbabies. There will also be quaint meditation areas for quiet, personal respite amid the comforting greenery. The ultimate benefit of a life of sustainability is wellness, achieved only through a perfect balance between restful and active pursuits. This is what I-Land Residences Sucat’s carefully chosen amenities successfully provide—in today’s urban landscape where such an intangible aspiration is of seemingly low priority, it is instead the core value that this revolutionary vertical community provides.Being business-savvy should be fun, attainable and A+.

The highlight of the first day was the awards night which was attended by Manuel V. Pangilinan, Chairman and President of Metro Pacific Investments Corporation.On the second day, the delegates, who are CEOS of the MPH member hospitals from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, were transported to Alabang, Muntinlupa. The morning session was held at The Palms Country Club. The highlight of the morning session was the entertainment during lunch time which featured talents from Asian Hospital. These were Angela Abrio Emergency Room Nurse, Rye Tobias Operating Room Nurse, and the AHMC Doctors’ Chorale led by Dr. Jose Acuin, Asian Hospital Chief Medical Officer.After lunch, the delegates were brought to Asian Hospital and were warmly welcomed by Dr. Beaver Tamesis, Asian Hospital President and CEO. In his welcome remarks, Dr. Tamesis said the CEOs would be touring the hospital and will be showcasing not only the rooms and services but also the engineering part as well.“Please pay attention to everything—everything that you see, that greets you, that touches you, that meets you. That’s part of the story,” he said.Among the facilities that the CEOs visited were the Florence Lim-Chan Nursing Simulation Lab, Blood Bank Donor Center, the new Ambassador Suite.In his closing remarks, Dr. Harish Pillai, MPH CEO, thanked Dr. Tamesis and the Asian Hospital team for their hospitality and for putting together the hospital tour.“Thank you so much. We are totally floored and what a beautiful hospital! There is no doubt that you were able to put in the ‘Beaver’ effect. I have seen the ‘Beaver’ effect in the boardroom and I have seen the ‘Beaver’ effect during the rounds. It’s fantastic,” he said.Dr. Pillai added that this is the third CEO Summit and that MPH has been “trying its best to evolve and get better.” He added that he made a deliberate effort to speak less so that everyone will have an opportunity to participate and share their learnings.“This is where the companies are evolving together. It is never a one man show. It is basically the strength of the team that is constantly trying to identify its weakest link and make that weak link the source of strength and opportunity,” he said, adding that the big takeaway is for all of them to learn from each other.Dr. Pillai also expressed his profound gratitude to the CEOs for taking the time out to attend the two-day CEO Summit.“What makes this organization so beautiful and it is not just because of the scale and size but the depth of our relationship. We are truly a family. I think that is the big transformation of what we have come across,” he said.He added that he looks forward to the next hosting of the CEO Summit, adding that this would be an opportunity to really get to know the other hospitals in the group.“This is an important feature of our evolution as a group that each host hospital does this kind of tour and we learn and do a deep dive and I think that is what makes us fascinating. Thank you so much for your time. The fact that you are here heart and soul, that means a lot,” Dr. Pillai said."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/27/healthfirst-promises-simplified-better-patient-journey-quality-healthcare/,"HealthFirst promises simplified, better patient journey, quality healthcare","“Our promise to all our patients is that when you come in, we will simplify things for you and make the journey better for you. You will be guided and well taken cared of just like family.”That was the promise made by Karl G. Dimaano, General Manager and COO of HealthFirst, at the grand opening of HealthFirst Williams Center located at Williams Corner Mayflower Street, Greenfield District, Mandaluyong City.He pointed out that after the pandemic, the perception of people about healthcare access had changed. They no longer wanted to visit hospitals and instead gravitated towards outpatient care.“We are basically just providing patients with what they need because of the change that was brought about by Covid. The real objective of having everything together in one place is basically centered on the patient, the patient journey, Dimaano added.HEALTHFIRST Clinic began as an in-house clinic of Unilab, the leading pharmaceutical company in the country. After years of offering quality service to thousands of employees of Unilab, it opened its doors to the public in 2006.Today, HealthFirst Clinic is a growing network of premier multi-specialty clinics that offer convenient and quality outpatient healthcare serve in a one-stop-shop setting. HealthFirst currently has eight sites and eight dialysis centers.HealthFirst Clinic is part of RelianceUnited, a member of the United Laboratories Group. RelianceUnited offers the most comprehensive suite of Corporate Healthcare Solutions to improve employee wellness and productivity while reducing employer healthcare cost through the delivery of simpler and better employee and employer experience.Other companies under RelianceUnited include Flexicare, Medpass Medbase, ActiveOne Pharmacy.“HealthFirst is a health platform. With the RelianceUnited consolidated portfolio, we have our insurance, health benefits administration, corporate clinic management, heart program, eye program. It’s the entire medical benefits, health screening access that the Human Resources head can come to us,” Dimaano explained.RelianceUnited offers the most comprehensive suite of Corporate Healthcare Solutions to improve employee wellness and productivity, while reducing employer healthcare cost through the delivery of a simpler and better employee and employer experience.According to Dr. Robert T. Castro, Medical Director of HealthFirst Clinics, HealthFirst offers more or less 21 specialty services that include rehabilitation medicine, physical therapy, women’s health, eye clinic, surgical procedures, pediatrics, cardiology, executive check-ups and preemployment health services.What makes the HealthFirst Williams Center distinct from the other clinics is that it has a Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, probably the first outpatient clinic to have such a facility.“In the United States, many outpatient clinics have cardiac cathlabs. They are more accessible to patients, the price of angioplasties here are much lower and infection control is better because it is not a hospital facility,” Dr. Castro said.In addition to the cardiac cathlab, HealthFirst also has an eye clinic or EyeSite, which is a partnership with the Asian Eye Institute. EyeSite’s goal is to make high quality eye care accessible and affordable for anyone. Those who will avail of the Executive Package will be assigned to one room where most of the services can be rendered with privacy.“We are planning to offer mental health services and extend that to neurodevelopmental health facility for children. We are also looking to expanding our ambulatory surgical procedures. Anything that can be safely done in an outpatient setting, will be offered like arthroscopy and other procedures,” Dr. Castro said.While healthcare spending is not a priority expenditure, Dimaano said HealthFirst is making their services as accessible as possible so that every Filipino will have equitable access to healthcare.“We have partnered with the Department of Social Welfare and Development and other government agencies to ensure that the financial aspect is also part of the accessibility. That will make us different,” he said.Dimaano reiterated that they are “reengineering their process flows to make the patient journey simple.”“We are simplifying things on behalf of our patients. We have always looked at being in the patients’ shoes every time we make decisions on growth programs and improvement programs because at the end of the day, it is the patient who matters,” he said."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/27/health-experts-call-for-fdas-approval-of-dengue-vaccine-collaboration-for-zero-casualty/,"Health experts call for FDA’s approval of dengue vaccine, collaboration for zero casualty","LEADERS of some doctor organizations called on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve the 2nd generation dengue vaccine, as the country continues to trail behind other Southeast Asian nations, in so far as inoculation against the mosquito-borne disease is concerned. “The study that is being done in the Philippines started in 2016, and I’m one of the principal investigators. Together with Thailand and Sri Lanka, [the] Philippines has one of the biggest number of subjects in this, and I do not really understand why we are still lagging behind in terms of licensure,” Philippine Foundation for Vaccination Executive Director Dr. Lulu Bravo said in a presscon during the First Dengue Summit organized by the Philippine Medical Association (PMA), together with the Philippine College of Physicians (PCP) and the Philippine Pediatric Society, at the Diamond Hotel in Manila last June 25, 2024.Japanese drugs manufacturer Takeda Pharmaceuticals applied last year for the FDA registration of its dengue vaccine named QDENGA, according to her. Its approval, however, is still pending while this was already licensed in Indonesia in August 2023, followed immediately by Thailand that year, Malaysia in February 2024, and Vietnam just last month.“This is why we have to tell our government, [through] FDA, to license [it] because the Philippines has the biggest number of dengue cases, and we are lagging behind. And if we don’t do it, tourists will not come, even if we have the most beautiful country,” she said.While it’s understandable that the FDA has to go through a process in approving QDENGA, PMA President Dr. Hector Santos hopes it considers the history of licensing the vaccine from other markets abroad. “I don’t think our criteria are more stringent than other countries. And presenting the data, millions are already vaccinated in other countries with the safety as well,” he said. “We would like to request. But we cannot, of course, push the government. We will have them go through the due process.”Being a vaccine investigator herself, Bravo guaranteed the safety of QDENGA. She said: “We have been doing it for eight years now since 2016, and we did see no safety signal at all. It can be given for those who have not had previous dengue, which is what is different from the previous first generation dengue vaccine that it was meant to be given only to those who had previous dengue.”The first and last dengue vaccine the Philippines approved was Dengvaxia of Sanofi Pasteur in 2016. The country was the pioneer in Asia to license this first-ever antidote in the world.Due to the 2017 controversy faced by the manufacturer after it announced that Dengvaxia might result to “severe” symptoms for those who have never been afflicted by dengue prior to inoculation. Because of that, the FDA ordered suspension of its sale, distribution and marketing nationwide, as well as its withdrawal from the market. It happened at the time the dengue vaccination program was implemented under then Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Janette Garin.BASED on the recent data from the DOH, the number of dengue cases aggregated to 67,874 from January 1 to May 25, 2024, with 189 related deaths. Of the totality, 60 percent show no symptoms, 39 percent with warning signs, and one percent severe condition.“The Philippines is one of those countries that’s known to be endemic for dengue. So there is a continuous possible transmission of the virus—the disease itself,” Dr. Santos said.Dengue is spread via a virus from the bite of a female mosquito (Aedes aegypti). While most cases of which do not have warning signs, common symptoms include high fever, severe headache, body pain, nausea, vomiting and rashes. Such indications may be experienced four to 10 days after a mosquito bite.Infectious diseases expert Dr. Rontgene Solante shared that vector surveillance, vector management, vector control, patient education, and disease management has been practiced nationwide since the first dengue epidemic emerged in 1954.Even though these initiatives have helped mitigate the likelihood of an epidemic, he pointed out vaccination could avert problems related to the disease from occurring in the future. Inoculation results to less hospitalization, he said while reminding that the vaccine “is not only protecting you from dengue, it is protecting you against the severe form of dengue so you don’t get hospitalized.”Given the successful Covid-19 vaccination program of the government, he believes that Filipinos are now more receptive of a new dengue shot than the previous years. “I would say most likely we have matured in terms of vaccination because of our experience with COVID-19,” he said. “This will be a whole nation approach that will also include all of those who are stakeholders that will benefit with vaccination.”THE health experts also pledged to help realize the “Zero Dengue Death by 2030, in lieu to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) No. 3 that is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being across all age groups.In a video message shown during the summit, DOH Secretary Ted Herbosa said that attaining such a goal was “ambitious yet within our grasp” if there’s collaboration and combined action from government agencies, healthcare institutions and practitioners, community groups, and the business community. “The journey to achieving zero dengue deaths by 2030 will not be easy, but it is a journey we must undertake with determination and unity. Let us be inspired by the progress we have made and be motivated to push further, innovate more, and collaborate better. Together, we can create a future where dengue is no longer a threat to every Filipino,” he said.Dr. Santos could not agree more with the health secretary, though, he admitted that “it is a difficult task to have a zero death by 2030.”For Dr. Bravo, it’s “attainable”, as she cited, for instance, Cebu communities reporting no casualty for the past years due to “following a simple protocol for management of treatment.”To attain such objective, Solante emphasized the need to continue dengue surveillance, especially at the level of the local government unit (LGU), and the early management framework of LGUs.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/27/philhealth-urged-to-tap-modern-dialyzers-lab-tests-medications-in-dialysis-coverage/,"PhilHealth urged to tap modern dialyzers, lab tests, medications in dialysis coverage","AMID a recent report that the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) will increase the P2,600 financial support for hemodialysis to P4,000 per session, the Philippine Society of Nephrology (PSN) is calling for the inclusion of modern dialysis technologies, laboratory tests and medicines in the benefits coverage for members with chronic kidney disease (CKD). According to PSN Secretary Dr. Vimar Luz, the package still applies to low-flux dialysis. Its upgraded version or the high-flux dialysis, on the other hand, is now mostly used elsewhere in the world, apart from other advanced equipment like Hemodiafiltration (HDF). Low-flux dialysis is a kind of dialysis treatment that utilizes a lower rate of blood flow and dialysate flow compared to high-flux dialysis. The latter has better dialysis adequacy. HDF is a kind of kidney replacement therapy that uses convective in combination with diffusive clearance. “These new technologies are not yet covered by the present [PhilHealth benefit package]. They have been proven beneficial, wherein the life survival of the patient is better,” he told reporters at the sidelines of Agham Kapihan forum, which was held in Makati City last June 20, 2024 in observance of the National Kidney Month.While these are the latest dialysis tools that are presently available in the market, they also come at a higher price. For the high flux dialysis, the additional copay per session will be from P500 to P1,000, as for HDF, it’s an additional P1,000 per treatment since it uses ultra pure water as part of the filtration process. “So it takes a certain amount. But by law of economics, if every [health or dialysis center] will have ultra pure water, the cost will somehow go down,” he noted. While the subsidy for PhilHealth dialysis patients will be back to P4,000 each session, it won’t include lab tests and medicines that used to be covered by such amount during the term of former presidents Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) and the late Benigno “PNoy” Aquino III. “Back in the day, I think that was the time of GMA and PNoy, dialysis centers have the leeway to have a portion of that treatment be channeled to laboratories and medications,” Dr. Luz said. “So that’s one of our advocacies—to push that they will be covered by the PhilHealth.” The state-owned health insurer, on its part, is enhancing financial coverage for Primary Care through another iteration of the regular nationwide Konsulta package, aiming for a higher capitation rate, giving incentives for early disease detection and prevention services.For several years that the group of Dr. Luz has been meeting with the PhilHealth, he noted that the agency is actually studying their recommendation. He added that it also plans to change the coverage to be diagnosis-driven, where it will subsidize the treatment of different complications that the CKD patient has rather than the dialysis itself. The medications to cure complications are, more often than not, pricey that only the well-off can afford.“That’s one of the big risk factors that I see for developing countries like us. The life expectancy of a person who have the means is longer versus a free standing patient who really depend on PhilHealth,” Dr. Luz said, while citing the latest data that show the average life span of dialysis patients is about five years. “Although we have patients that can live for 10 years to 20 years more.”So there’s really a big gap between the moneyed and the poor patients, per Dr. Cyril Tolosa, medical affairs director of AstraZeneca Philippines.Based on PhilHealth data, it spent P17 billion for dialysis coverage alone last year. “But again, even on top of that, the patient themselves will need to pay a lot of medications monthly to prevent the complications like heart failure or heart attacks, or other organ diseases. So the burden is really in the patients, the family, and even economically for the government,” he said.“This is the reason why AstraZeneca would like to focus on chronic kidney disease, not on the late stage, but on the earlier part. So our advocacy is about early screening, early diagnosis and get yourself treated in case you have a chronic kidney disease. Also, our focus is on preventing the chronic kidney disease, at the same time, delaying its progress in case you have it. And this is the reason why we’re partnering with the Philippine Society of Nephrology to promote kidney awareness.” MORE and more Filipinos have been diagnosed with CKD for the past recent news, which health experts believe could be addressed by early screening and prevention.CKD prevalence in the Philippines is 35.94 percent, which is much higher than estimated global rates between 9.1 percent to 13.4 percent. Data from the National Kidney and Transplant Institute (NKTI) revealed that seven million Filipinos have worsening CKD stages (Stage 3 or above) in 2021. Approximately, one Filipino every hour will develop CKD. Earlier, the NKTI had expressed alarm over the 40 percent increase in new dialysis patients between 2022 and 2023.Dr. Luz, who is also the head of STOP CKD Advocacy, underscored that early screening and lifestyle changes are key to addressing the kidney disease epidemic. He said: “When we say dialysis, that’s end stage. Gusto natin labanan bago ka pa magkaroon ng sakit sa bato (We want to fight it prior to have a kidney disease).”The nephrologist recommended the “eight golden rules” to prevent having a CKD. These include the following: Exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, control blood sugar, control blood pressure, drink adequate water, stop smoking, don’t abuse pain relievers and supplements, and have a regular checkup.Besides partnering with the PNS via the STOP CKD program, AstraZeneca, on its part, has also been promoting awareness of the disease online through Kidney Patrol, a social media page that promotes kidney health. The page runs an online questionnaire called CKD Risk Quiz. Filipinos can take this quiz to assess their risks and be proactive about kidney health.“We are transforming CKD care to drive earlier diagnosis and intervention and help prevent or slow progression of the disease,” said Dr. Tolosa.“ CKD (Kidney disease is avoidable. Not all CKD should end up in dialysis),” added Luz. Roderick L. Abad graduated from Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, with a degree course in Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communication.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/27/ai-adoption-could-speed-up-tb-detection-in-phl/,AI adoption could speed up TB detection in PHL,"It has become increasingly apparent that the fight against tuberculosis (TB) in the Philippines is more urgent than ever. Just in 2023, over 600,000 TB cases were recorded, and the national government has since then allocated more funding into combatting this disease. With more efforts being placed into preventative measures, there’s an opportunity to adopt more modern solutions like artificial intelligence (AI) to effectively support this mission.The recently-launched portable AI-driven x-ray system, Advanced Abilities AI Smart Scan, is capable of detecting 32 pathologies and/or conditions, including TB. It can deliver up to 200 scans in 8 hours, cutting turnaround times from days to minutes, which ensures timely intervention and enhanced patient outcomes.While those features sound attractive, the prospect of using AI may still seem daunting to many. However, there are cases in the Philippines that have shown that AI has been a useful tool for early detection of TB. For instance, it was reported in February 2024 that TB screening had become available in the Cordillera region through a DOH-CAR mobile TB clinic, featuring the latest AI technology that can spot the presence of TB. In terms of a long-term approach, the DOH has been planning to adopt a shorter TB treatment scheme by the latter half of 2024, with AI being used through radiographs to catch signs of TB.That being said, there is a strong possibility for AI Smart Scan to be a part of current and future initiatives that can help speed up the detection of TB in the Philippines. Most recently, Advanced Abilities hosted a medical outreach that utilized AI Smart Scan to evaluate 503 patients in the municipalities of San Fernando and Magdiwang in Romblon. Of the 503 patients, 424 of them had findings, with 63 of them having detected TB.“We are pleased to be able to bring our AI Smart Scan to Romblon, and contribute to the initiatives towards early TB prevention. We believe that this shift towards AI-assisted technology is the right direction for the local healthcare system to improve its performance and speed up TB detection,” shared Angelo Antonio “AA” Buendia, CEO of Advanced Abilities.On an international scale, AI Smart Scan has also been used in different parts of the world and is being integrated into local healthcare systems. In Chennai City, India, there were 20 per 100,000 subjects identified with TB before AI. With AI SmartScan, there are now 500 per 100,000 patients, resulting in a 25-fold increase in finding TB patients.The case also stands strongly in Singapore, where AI Smart Scan’s software, Augmento, is the current national radiology AI platform. As of writing, there are five listed government hospitals on the platform including Changi General, Singapore General and very soon, Tan Tock Seng, aiming to eventually have all twenty-six government hospitals on the platform.“The progressive advancement of technology is giving us more opportunities to find ways to keep up the fight against TB. As such, we are looking forward to developing our devices and conducting more outreach programs that can help more Filipinos possibly catch early signs of the disease,” says Buendia.With AI technology being gradually woven into both local and international healthcare systems, ushering AI Smart Scan into the Philippines should potentially contribute to lessening the number of tuberculosis cases with its quick turnaround times. This investment will be a step into a more modern and progressive healthcare system that will benefit the lives of Filipinos.To learn more about AI Smart Scan and Advanced Abilities’ Smart Health Solutions, visit"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/27/over-6000-pharmacists-upskilled-by-pharmacademy/,"Over 6,000 pharmacists upskilled by PharmAcademy","In just one year since joining forces with community-building platform SwipeRx and the Philippine Pharmacists Association Inc. (PPhA), Sanofi Consumer Healthcare has upskilled a total 6,457 pharmacists nationwide through its revolutionary learning platform, PharmAcademy.“As we now know, for every Filipino that visits their local doctor, 10 visit their local pharmacist for medical advice, so the more professionals we are able to teach through PharmAcademy, the more patient lives we are able to touch on-ground,” said Monsinee Sathirakawinskul, Sanofi Consumer Healthcare Country Head for Philippines CHC ASEA Zone.Officially launched in the Philippines during PPhA’s 2023 National Conference, PharmAcademy is a platform to equip pharmacists with the skills to play a more proactive role in disease management and prevention, especially in counseling about illnesses that can be prevented by lifestyle adjustments and proper self-care.For this year’s conference, PPhA placed a focus on the state of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). A 2023 study published in the Annals of Hepatology revealed that 4% of deaths annually in the world are caused by liver disease, and has become a pressing matter in the Philippines as well.Dr. Denis Cua Ngo, President of the Philippine Society of Gastroenterology provided key insights on the severity of the disease in the country, saying, “We are facing epidemic of obesity which will almost inevitably result in an increase in rates of NAFLD and NASH, and eventually a burden of end-stage liver disease.”In the Philippines alone, around 27 cases in 1,000 deaths in the Philippines can be attributed to liver disease. While alarming in number, lifestyle modification and proactive liver care remain to be the cornerstone of prevention. Pharmacists are instrumental in promoting proper healthcare practices within the communities they serve, making learning tools like PharmAcademy even more relevant, especially in tackling cases of NAFLD and NASH.Changing the pharmacy practice one accreditation at a timeOnly on its second year in the Philippines, PharmAcademy has aided in the progress of proactive healthcare at the forefront of pharmacist education. To date, 2,314 pharmacists have received CPD-accreditation for completing Immunology 101, while 2,219 have been accredited for mastering the ABCs of multivitamins.Gut health was also a prominent part of the pharmacists’ education, with the alliance having issued a combined total of 2,785 accreditations on the following modules: Gut Immunity and the role of Probiotics in Diarrhea Management, and Case-Based Approach to Digestive Health.Regulated by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC), these modules work to improve over-the-counter patient care overall, allowing upskilled pharmacists enough knowledge to confidently fulfill their role as frontline healthcare providers.The interest to explore post-pandemic servicing strategies were also evident, as a total of 4,961 completed soft skill modules covering topics like “Pandemic communication barriers with customers” and “Understanding customers’ behaviors post-COVID.”These soft skills are essential in advising for individual patient care and help pharmacists better understand the importance of effective communication during crises, where patient uncertainty and anxiety is at its peak.As PharmAcademy persists to upskill pharmacists across the nation, its second year will now include interactive sessions with industry thought leaders and offline knowledge-transfer sessions, on top of the readily available modules that pharmacists can access on the SwipeRx app.“By enabling pharmacists and pharmacist assistants to step into their role as the primary healthcare providers of their community, we empower each patient who seek their guidance to have more control of their healthcare journey, ultimately allowing them to put their health into their own hands,” Dr. Yvonne Ferrer, Sanofi Consumer Healthcare ASEA Medical Lead, concluded."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/27/doctor-calls-for-raising-of-legal-age-for-purchase-of-vape-products-to-25/,Doctor calls for raising of legal age for purchase of vape products to 25,"While the World Health Organization (WHO) calls for urgent action to protect children as well as non-smokers against the risks of e-cigarettes and minimize health hazards to the population, a pulmonologist in the Philippines is urging the government to raise the minimum age of people allowed to use vaping products from 18 to 25.Dr. Maricar Limpin, past president of the Philippine College of Chest Physicians, is alarmed that teenagers aged 13 to 15 are using vape. “We see that many of those who are falling ill are 22, 21, 23 years old. This means that 18-year-olds are allowed to purchase vape products. The allowable age then was 21 years old. It’s time to raise the age limit to 25,” Dr. Limpin recently said during a health event as she called for the amendment of the Vaporized Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Products Regulation Act, commonly known as the Vape Law.Dr. Limpin also noted that the maturation of the control center of the brain occurs at the age of 25. Stressing that it is one of the important ways to protect young people from the harm of tobacco use, including e-cigarettes, the Parents Against Vape (PAV) fully supports the call of Dr. Limpin.“We advocate for raising the legal age for purchasing vaping products from 18 to 25 years old. It is alarming to witness increasing numbers of young people, as early as 13 to 15 years old, engaging in vaping. Furthermore, significant health issues are being reported in individuals as young as 21 to 23 years old,” PAV said.The current law allowing 18-year-olds to purchase vape products, PAV said, is insufficient to protect the youth from the harmful effects of vaping.“Dr. Limpin’s proposal is backed by scientific research indicating that the brain’s control center matures at the age of 25. At this age, individuals are better equipped to make informed decisions and resist peer pressure. Raising the legal age to 25 will provide a more robust defense against early addiction and long-term health complications,” they added.Alcohol purchaseLikewise, Dr. Limpin also said that the legal age for drinking alcoholic beverages should also be raised to 25. “, anyway, same principles apply: maturation control center brain occurs at the age of 25,” she said. PAV supports the proposal to standardize the legal age for purchasing cigarettes and alcohol to 25 saying, “this approach ensures fairness and consistency in protecting public health across all harmful substances.”Likwise, PAV also endorsed Dr. Limpin’s recommendation to shift regulatory authority from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). “Health should be the primary concern, and the FDA is better equipped to regulate vaping products with a focus on public health rather than economic interests. This change would align the Philippines with international standards where food and drug agencies regulate e-cigarettes and other health devices,” the group reiterated.“Moreover, we strongly agree with the removal of flavored vape products. Studies have shown that flavors contribute significantly to DNA damage, increasing the risk of cancer. Likewise, flavored vape products primarily attract and appeal to the youth. Furthermore, the reintroduction of these flavors contradicts previous measures under the Sin Tax Reform Law and poses unnecessary risks to public health,” they added. PAV urges lawmakers to take these recommendations seriously and amend the Vape Law to better protect our youth and ensure a healthier future for all as they commend Senator Pia Cayetano and the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee for their efforts to review and strictly implement the law.“Let us prioritize the health and wellbeing of our children and communities by making these essential changes. Together, we can create a healthier and safer environment for all,” the group concluded.Dr. Limpin’s call came as the Department of Health called on Filipinos to “love yourself and care for others by not smoking or vaping” as the country observes “No Smoking Month” this June.-‘turn off’ vape ,” the DOH said. [It is a real turn off to smoke and to vape because it has negative effects on our health. Your habit can also affect the people around you as the smoke can irritate your nose, throat, skin and eyes especially children.] The DOH stressed, “!” [No one wins when you have a vice.] Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development (PLCPD), Social Watch Philippines (SWP), and the Philippine Smoke-Free Movement (PSFM), meanwhile, has called on all Filipinos to be one with the fight for a smoke-free Philippines. The three organizations recently launched an early prevention awareness activity that shows the ill-effects of vaping and smoking among Filipinos, especially the youth.“Let every month be a no- smoking month so that we can build an environment free from tobacco,” Au Quilala, Deputy Executive Director of PLCPD said, reiterating the need to ensure the good health of every Filipino. She urged local governments to continuously push through with early prevention awareness activities “because we need strong support from legislators and local chief executives to ensure that children and youth are protected against the schemes of tobacco industry that lures them to try cigarettes and vapes”.PSFM’s National Coordinator Riza Duro, meanwhile, said that the first “vape-related death” is a sign that local government units should focus on the issue of vapes. She called on the need to strictly regulate the sale and marketing of vape as this encourage children and youth to try them.Presidential Proclamation No. 183 declares the month of June as the National No-Smoking Month.The DOH has encouraged smokers and vapers to kick the bad habit to improve one’s health.Meanwhile, the Parents Against Vape (PAV) stressed that vaping is never a cessation tool for tobacco smokers as claimed by the vaping industry. PAV said that the purpose of vaping is not to induce smokers to quit, but rather to shift to a similar deadly product.“We have studies from our FGD that show that a) some youth vapers have never smoked but went directly into vaping; and b) smokers who vape become dual users because they go back to using traditional cigarettes if they don’t have money to buy vape juice,” PAV said.The 2019 Global Youth Tobacco Survey showed that one on every seven Filipino youth age 13 to 15 use vape. PAV said the number could be higher this year given as indicated by the proliferation of vape shops across the country. While PAV calls for strict implementation of RA 11900 or the Vape Law, the organization is also pushing for the amendment of the law. “There are three things that should be done to keep our youth from vapes. First, increase access from 18 years old to 21. Second, limit flavors to menthol and tobacco. Flavors entice and get the youth addicted to vapes. And third, return regulatory power to the Food and Drug Administration,” PAV stressed. The World Health Organization (WHO) said that quitting smoking decreases the excess risk of many diseases related to second-hand smoke in children, such as respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma) and ear infections.If a person will quit smoking, it reduces the chances of impotence, having difficulty getting pregnant, having premature births, babies with low birth weights and miscarriage.Beneficial health changes that take place include:Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/27/unilab-invests-in-advanced-technology-for-streamlined-operations-tailors-approach-to-filipino-market/,"Unilab invests in advanced technology for streamlined operations, tailors approach to Filipino market","BIÑAN, LAGUNA—Pharmaceutical giant Unilab disclosed that they have heavily invested in technology despite having only one distribution center (DC) nationwide.“Unilab is the only one who believes that having a central DC is more efficient than having multiple ones,” Albert Allan Alcruz, Assistant Vice President at Unilab, Inc., Logistics Management Division said last June 14, 2024 during an exclusive media tour at Amherst Laboratories. According to Alcruz, their distribution center efficiently serves not just the Philippines’ over 7,000 islands but also extends its reach to 18 countries worldwide. He emphasized the center’s productivity, noting its role in managing the operations of four manufacturing plants located abroad—specifically, one in Indonesia, two in Myanmar, and two in Vietnam—all operated centrally from the main distribution hub.In their development, the pick director system has emerged as a solution to a pressing issue in consumer goods management that highlights the challenges faced by both consumers and boutiques and this system aims to streamline operations and enhance efficiency.“The consumer wants premium products at affordable prices. They prefer to purchase items consistently, albeit in smaller quantities tailored to their needs,” he added. The pick director system addressed this consumer behavior by optimizing inventory management. It allows boutiques to cater precisely to consumer demands, avoiding the bulk purchase of entire packages. Instead, they can order specific quantities of popular items, such as six of one type and two of another, reflecting what is in demand.The complexity of managing diverse consumer preferences is evident. “Without the pick director, fulfilling orders becomes impractical,” said AVP at Unilab. “So we designed the DC for the needs of the Filipinos,” Alcruz added. He said that they found operating with a single distribution center more efficient compared to multiple centers. Despite logistical challenges, he stressed the advantage of their integrated network.“In the Philippines, you can’t expect the same truck to deliver directly to customers,” he explained. “It requires a multimodal approach where trucks transport goods to ports, then onto ships destined for places like Mindanao, where tricycles complete the last mile,” he added. He acknowledged the need for flexibility and durable packaging due to these logistical complexities. “Even with a hub in Mindanao and a small office in Davao, reaching remote areas remains a challenge due to terrain and traffic conditions.”“Understanding the diverse needs and capacities of Filipinos is crucial for effective service delivery,” he added.He also mentioned that Unilab, a company valued at over a billion dollars and managing approximately 800 different products, emphasized the significance of centralized inventory management. Centralizing operations allows better control over inventory levels, reducing the logistical complexities associated with distributing products across multiple locations.It has been reported that the distribution center processes more than 45,000 transactions monthly, overseen by the pick director system.One of the products being processed and distributed here is Solmux Advance, which Unilab asserts as the Philippines’ first and only cough remedy for phlegm that combines carbocisteine and zinc. According to Maria Ronila Santos, Director, Medical Affairs of Unilab, carbocisteine helps to dissolve phlegm, making it easier to cough up and expel, and also reduces and eliminates bacteria in the phlegm. Meanwhile, zinc functions to enhance immunity and acts as an antioxidant.She explained that the most common cause of coughs is often linked to the common cold, a mild viral infection affecting the respiratory tract.“Coughing due to the common cold is a frequent reason people visit doctors. It’s typically managed on an outpatient basis,” she added. But, before prescribing treatment, she emphasized the importance of differentiating between types of coughs—dry and productive (with phlegm). Medications like expectorants and mucolytics are commonly used to help clear mucus from the airways, making it easier to breathe.Santos also discussed the role of zinc in immune health. “Zinc plays a critical role in the body’s immune response,” she explained. “Low zinc levels during an infection may prolong recovery.”“It’s crucial to initiate zinc intake early when experiencing symptoms of the common cold,” advises medical affairs of Unilab director. Research indicates that up to 75 milligrams of zinc per day may be necessary to optimize its effects in reducing the duration and severity of symptoms.However, caution is advised regarding the upper limit of zinc intake. The tolerable upper level, which represents the maximum amount considered safe for daily consumption, is set at 40 milligrams for Filipinos according to local nutrition guidelines.For instance, a product combining carbocisteine and zinc, available in a five-milligram capsule, when taken at recommended doses, provides approximately 15 milligrams of zinc daily. Taking two such capsules would amount to 30 milligrams per day, aligning with safety limits.“Adherence to local nutritional standards is essential to avoid potential adverse effects associated with excessive zinc intake,” Santos said, adding that this approach ensures that zinc supplementation remains effective and safe for managing symptoms of respiratory infections like the common cold."

In barely six months, countries in the Americas have already for dengue cases.The World Health Organization in December, and Puerto Rico in March.Dengue remains less common in the continental United States, but in the 50 states so far this year there have been three times more cases than at the same point last year. Most were infections that travelers got abroad, and officials note there is no evidence of a current outbreak. But they also warn that local mosquitos pose a threat.In its health alert issued recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised doctors to know the symptoms, ask questions about where patients recently traveled and consider ordering dengue tests when appropriate.Dengue is caused by a virus spread by a type of warm weather mosquito that is expanding its geographic reach because of climate change, experts say.Many infected people don’t get sick, but some experience headache, fever and flu-like symptoms. Severe cases can involve cause serious bleeding, shock and death.Repeated infections can be especially dangerous.There are four types of dengue virus, simply known as 1, 2, 3 and 4. When someone is first infected, their body builds antibodies against that type for life. If they get infected with another type of dengue, the antibodies from the first infection may fail to neutralize the second type—and actually can help the virus enter immune cells and replicate.That’s a concern in Puerto Rico, which for the last two decades has been widely exposed to type 1. Last month, the island reported its first dengue death of the year.“We’re currently seeing is increases in the cases due to dengue 2 and dengue 3, for which the population has very little immunity,” said Dr. Gabriela Paz-Bailey, the Puerto-Rico-based chief of the CDC’s dengue branch.There is no widely available medicine for treating dengue infections.Vaccines have been tricky. US officials in 2021 recommended one vaccine, made by Sanofi Pasteur. The three-dose vaccine is built to protect against all four dengue types and is recommended only for children ages 9 to 16 who have laboratory evidence of an earlier dengue infection and who live in an area—like Puerto Rico—where dengue is common.Given those restrictions and other issues, it hasn’t been widely used. As of late last month, only about 140 children had been vaccinated in Puerto Rico since shots became available there in 2022, and Sanofi Pasteur has told the CDC it is going to stop making the vaccine.A different vaccine made by the Tokyo-based pharmaceutical company Takeda is not currently licensed in the U.S. Others are in development.Across the world, more than 6.6 million infections were reported by about 80 countries last year. In the first four months of this year, 7.9 million cases and 4,000 deaths have been reported, according to the World Health Organization. It’s been particularly in the Americas, including in and .In the United States, the numbers —about 3,000 cases last year in US states and territories. But it was the worst in a decade, and included more infections that occurred locally, courtesy of native mosquitoes. Most were in Puerto Rico, but about 180 were in three US states—Florida, Texas and California.So far this year, there have been nearly 1,500 locally-acquired US cases, nearly all of them in Puerto Rico.Most cases in the continental U.S. continue to be people who were infected while traveling internationally.It’s “a traveler’s nightmare” and a growing international concern, said Dr. Lulu Bravo, who studies pediatric tropical diseases at the University of the Philippines Manila and who has worked with Takeda on its vaccine.“When you have an outbreak in a country, tourists might not want to come,” Bravo said."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/27/investing-in-community-health-the-sm-investments-corp-s-way/,Investing in community health the SM Investments Corp.’s way,"Investing in healthcare has never been more important than now with the tough lessons of the recent pandemic.One of these lessons revealed the vulnerability of health systems buckling under the strain of huge medical demands at the height of Covid-19. While both the public and private sectors needed to step up, there is an even bigger need to anticipate, more than just respond to any future health crisis.This brings to light the importance of access and what the private sector has been doing in helping bridge the healthcare socio-economic gap. For SM and its foundations, this means better community access to quality primary healthcare in partnership with national and local governments.Medical missions allow access, especially of remote or economically disadvantaged communities, to medical care, education and support. SM Foundation’s (SMFI) medical missions provide free consultations, basic laboratory tests, dental check-ups and proper dosage of appropriate medicine. SM Foundation reached an important milestone by conducting more than 1,600 medical missions, benefiting nearly 1.3 million patients year-to-date.“Patients who once endured long queues at crowded healthcare facilities now find relief as we bring healthcare services to remote barangays or provide them conveniently at our malls and properties,” Connie Angeles, SM Foundation Executive Director for Health and Medical Programs said.While health facilities offer a venue for the conduct of medical services, fixing it up through thoughtful and meaningful design could do more for the community than just provide space. Rural health centers are considered as lifelines, offering a comprehensive range of health services at a minimal cost or even free to the most vulnerable.“These opportunities to rebuild health centers do more for human well-being. The refurbishment of public healthcare facilities not only enhance their capabilities by way of improvements and new equipment but also make these facilities more responsive and conducive to the health needs and recovery of those they serve,” Angeles said.Furthermore, the renovation allows public health centers to meet PhilHealth Accreditation standards, resulting in an increase in PhilHealth utilization and helping decongest city hospitals and minimizing the spread of communicable diseases.Through these accredited health centers, patients could avail themselves of PhilHealth benefits such as primary care, maternity care and pharmacy needs at the barangay level. These efforts also result in increased capitalization for local governments. Many sectors also benefit from these renovations including the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippine National Police, terminally ill patients and women and children to name a few.SM Foundation’s 200th rural health center in Laguna is a classic example. “space,” said Dr. Elmira Montesa who leads the Santa Cruz Rural Health Unit (SCRHU). [We have many programs that we can’t accommodate because there is not enough space and we are scrambling for places for these.] Following the Department of Health’s (DOH) guidelines, SM Foundation elevated the SCRHU. The rehabilitation transformed the center into a welcoming space, featuring comfortable waiting areas, a reception area for health workers and designated facilities for breastfeeding mothers, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. It has a mobileplay cabinet for children coping with illnesses. SM also included a rainwater catchment system to the renovated facility to contribute to water conservation.In 2023, SM Foundation breathed new life into UP-PGH’s post-Covid & PulmoCare hub.Prior to the rehabilitation, UP-PGH Division of Pulmonary Medicine chief Dr. Lenora Fernandez recalled that the facility struggled to expand its services to meet the growing needs of the community.“PGH does have many donors but they have so many competing priorities, too. Those patients who continued to suffer from debilitating shortness of breath in silence still lacked essential services such as pulmonary rehabilitation equipment,” Dr. Fernandez said.The newly refurbished facility now has a new lobby to receive patients and spacious rooms with dedicated areas for rehabilitation, ultrasound, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and virtual consultation. Dr. Fernandez expressed optimism about the future of the hub and sees the number of patients served growing every year.In Brgy. Irawan, Puerto Princesa, a community birthing facility’ serving thousands of residents and indigenous people, had to halt operations in 2018 as it was unable to meet government health requirements.“birthing facility facility, ,” midwife Narcisa Jagmis, a member of the Tagbanua tribe, and who leads the birthing facility said. [Even though it is several kilometers away from my fellow natives, this is the closest birthing facility here in our area. When we were stopped, there were times when someone was giving birth inside the car.] SM Foundation supported the community by revamping the birthing facility in 2023, enabling it to obtain the required licenses to resume operations. Dedicated rooms and spaces for storage, scrub-up, breastfeeding, consultations, birthing, clean-up and sterilization, as well as labor and recovery wards were added. It also introduced a rainwater harvesting system and installed energy-efficient lighting fixtures and appliances.Another SM affiliate, BDO Foundation, also achieved a major milestone as it rehabilitated its 160th rural health unit (RHU) in 2023. This involved renovating exteriors, layout and interior design, lobbies and waiting areas, offices, birthing clinics, consultation rooms, treatment rooms and pharmacies as well as installing breastfeeding stations for nursing mothers, play areas for children, and waiting lounges for senior citizens.BDO Foundation also installed new signages, furniture, and fixtures to help health workers accommodate more patients in environments conducive to good health and well-being. The improvement of facilities empowers doctors, nurses, and midwives to provide quality primary healthcare services more often and more efficiently to their constituents. The initiative also benefits mothers, infants and children, persons with disabilities, senior citizens, and indigenous peoples living in remote areas.BDO Unibank and BDO Network Bank officers also recommended health centers in need of assistance. The DOH, local government leaders, and health officers backed the initiative by providing guidance on the renovation of RHUs. Through the rehabilitation program, BDO Foundation helped health centers receive high assessment scores in healthcare delivery from the DOH and accreditation from PhilHealth. These improve the healthcare delivery system in the is one of the goals under the Philippine Health Agenda.Combined, SM Foundation and BDO Foundation have refurbished and built a total of 364 health centers and medical facilities.As the group reaches out to more communities, it aims to effectively contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health & Wellbeing) by consistently providing equitable access to quality basic services towards a better and healthier tomorrow."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/27/health-experts-raise-red-flag-vs-lesser-known-respiratory-virus/,Health experts raise red flag vs lesser-known respiratory virus,"It seems like there is a never-ending challenge for senior citizens and persons with comorbidities as far as respiratory viruses are concerned.After the Covid-19 debacle, public health experts have raised concerns about the serious risks associated with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) on senior citizens. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the country has over nine million seniors aged 60 and above. Seniors, especially those who have comorbidities, are at higher risk of severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infections due to their weakened immune systems.In a recent forum, Dr. Rontgene Solante, an Infectious Disease Expert and President of the Philippine College of Physicians, described RSV as a widespread yet lesser-known respiratory virus that transmits through inhalation or contact with respiratory secretions of those infected. It typically manifests symptoms including congestion, cough, wheezing, and low-grade fever.“Identifying RSV from other respiratory diseases is difficult because of its non-specific symptoms similar to other illnesses. Diagnosis requires testing that is often expensive and not widely accessible. Seniors and individuals with comorbidities may mistake their symptoms for a common cold or flu, not realizing they could be suffering from RSV, which can result in severe long-term damage or even fatal complications. More concerning is that there is no specific treatment for RSV in adults,” Solante explained in his presentation. While RSV can infect individuals at any time of the year, Solante warned it spreads more intensively during the rainy months from September to February, peaking in the colder months of October and December. He said the highly contagious virus spreads easily within households, where one infected person typically infects three others. While most are infectious for three to eight days, older adults may transmit the virus for extended periods. “Our seniors are particularly susceptible and vulnerable because, in Philippine culture, they often live with family members who also serve as their caregivers. These family members may unknowingly contract RSV at work or elsewhere and bring it home to their senior relatives. Within the household, symptoms might be dismissed as just the flu, not realizing that what’s circulating is RSV, which can be fatal for seniors.” said Dr. Solante.In her talk, Dr. Lourdes Dumlao, President of the Philippine College of Geriatric Medicine, said that RSV is often depicted as a pediatric illness on social media because children, like seniors, have weak immune systems, making them vulnerable. However, she pointed out that RSV presents a greater burden on seniors. “Studies have shown that the incidence of hospitalizations and mortality due to RSV is substantially higher in seniors than in children. Seniors with certain underlying conditions such as pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are at higher risk of hospitalization when infected with RSV. Additionally, she said RSV can cause various severe respiratory complications in older adults, including arrest and failure, respiratory distress, and emphysema. Further, about 30 percent of older adults may develop heart complications when hospitalized with RSV.” Dr. Lenora C. Fernandez, head of Pulmonary Services at Asian Hospital and Medical Center and former President of the Philippine College of Chest Physicians, stressed that RSV patients will require extensive aftercare after hospital discharge, stressing the burden imposes not only on the patients themselves but also on their families. “One out of four RSV patients (24.5 percent) may require professional home care after hospital discharge.17 Additionally, up to one out of four (26.6 percent) of these patients are readmitted within three months post-discharge, and even more concerning, three out of ten (33 percent) may die from complications related to RSV within a year of their initial admission,” she said.Education and awareness are important in mitigating the health risks of RSV and putting importance on the need for both seniors and their caregivers to be well-informed. “RSV is difficult to detect and prone to misinformation so I advise seniors to discuss RSV with their doctors who can guide them on the necessary precautions to reduce their health risk,” he advises. Dr. Fernandez stressed there is a need for immediate action when flu-like symptoms appear within the household. “I recommend that families implement safety and hygiene protocols promptly to protect their seniors, such as isolating symptomatic individuals, wearing face masks, and engaging in frequent handwashing,” she adds. Dr. Dumlao said it is wise to adhere to the timeless maxim that prevention is better than cure. “Seniors must be proactive about their health,” she states. “Through regular medical consultations, seniors can ensure they receive the right interventions to mitigate RSV risks, while also adopting healthy habits like maintaining a healthy diet, getting adequate sleep, and engaging in regular exercise to boost their immune system.”Rizal Raoul S.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/27/city-of-manila-to-construct-first-lgu-cancer-facility-in-ncr/,City of Manila to construct first LGU cancer facility in NCR,"Speaker Ferdinand Martin G. Romualdez inaugurated on Tuesday the first local government cancer facility in Manila.During the groundbreaking ceremonies of the Gov. Benjamin Romualdez Cancer Center at the grounds of Ospital ng Maynila, the speaker said this is in compliance with the National Integrated Cancer Control Act (NICCA), or Republic Act (RA) No. 11215, which former President Duterte signed and enacted into law in 2019, or three years after he assumed office in mid-2016. “I have first-hand knowledge of this (cancer), losing my father to this dreaded disease. Here and now, I commit to fully supporting the completion of this medical facility that bears his name,” the Speaker said, noting this is “another step in the realization of the promise” for more hospitals. The first cancer center in the City of Manila was named after the speaker’s father. Romualdez clarified, though, that the “hospital is not the building alone.” “It has to be staffed by specialists, staff, and workers who shall attend to the needs of patients from Manila and nearby areas.” “I am grateful that the City of Manila, with its capable doctors and medical practitioners, has taken on this important challenge—not just to provide patients with affordable yet effective treatments for cancer in advanced stages, but to enable early cancer detection for better outcomes,” he said. “Cancer care is a broad field. From information and education initiatives down to the local barangay level, psychological support for patients and survivors, providing support for these initiatives, to research, to actual treatment, each of us has a role to play to achieve victory on this battlefield,” Romualdez said. The first local government cancer facility, the five-story center has a capacity of 38 beds and is equipped with state-of-the-art medical technology, including a linear accelerator, a spectrogram gamma camera with a treadmill machine, and a CT scan.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/27/makati-city-provides-free-chemo-treatment-for-makatizens-binay/,Makati City provides free chemo treatment for Makatizens–Binay,"The city-run Ospital ng Makati (OsMak) has provided free chemotherapy sessions to 8,980 patients since 2020, Makati City Mayor Abigail Binay said.“Since 2020, we have served nearly 9,000 patients with free chemotherapy at OsMak. We aim to ensure that every Makatizen receives the healthcare they need without worrying about the cost. We are here to support our residents in their fight against cancer,” Binay said, adding that such initiative is part of Makati’s unwavering commitment to healthcare, offering critical support to cancer patients through the city’s Yellow Card program.Binay explained that because PhilHealth only covers a fraction of the cost of chemotherapy, the city has taken additional steps to subsidize the remaining expenses, regardless of the cost. “Chemo is more expensive than dialysis because the type of medicine needed varies from patient to patient. We have patients with bills over P130,000 for a single session, and Philhealth only covers a maximum of P7,280 pesos. Most cancer patients cannot afford that, but our Yellow Card holders pay absolutely nothing,” the mayor explained.In December 2023, a 56-year-old patient from Barangay Palanan incurred a chemo session bill of P138,002.37, covering medicine, lab procedures, and supplies, without any cost to the patient. Similarly, on March 15, 2024, a 65-year-old woman from Guadalupe Nuevo had her treatment expenses of P132,824.40 entirely covered by the city.The mayor emphasized that the health of Makatizens is a top priority, and the city is dedicated to removing financial barriers to essential medical services.The majority of chemo patients at OsMak are being treated for breast cancer for females and prostate cancer for males. Sessions can either be weekly or every two weeks.The Yellow Card, officially known as the Makati Health Plus Program, is a pioneering healthcare initiative providing comprehensive medical benefits to registered residents.These benefits include free chemotherapy, unlimited dialysis, maintenance medicines, routine check-ups, and laboratory and diagnostic procedures.Under this program, Yellow Card holders enjoy significant healthcare subsidies, allowing them to access treatments without the burden of high out-of-pocket expenses. The city government covers costs not reimbursed by PhilHealth, ensuring continued healthcare for Yellow Card holders and their dependents not over 21 years old.By providing free chemotherapy and other essential medical services, Binay said, Makati has set the bar high for healthcare services in the country. Makati City reinforces its role as a leader in innovative and inclusive healthcare solutions by ensuring that all citizens, regardless of income, have access to life-saving treatments.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/25/the-dengue-fight-from-personal-vigilance-to-collective-resilience/,THE DENGUE FIGHT | From personal vigilance to collective resilience,"Ever wondered why getting dengue again can be worse?Dealing with dengue fever as a family is a difficult journey marked by fear, financial strain, and constant worry. Watching a loved one suffer from fever, joint pain, and exhaustion is heart-wrenching, with the uncertainty of their recovery adding to the stress. Mounting hospital bills and draining savings compound the financial burden. Additionally, the persistent fear of another family member contracting the virus from mosquitoes exacerbates the anxiety. Every mosquito bite feels like a potential threat, leading to frantic efforts to get rid of any standing water where they could breed. In the middle of it all, there is the mental toll of living under the constant shadow of dengue fever.Dengue poses a unique challenge as it can infect individuals a multiple times, with a second infection often proving more severe due to a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In ADE, antibodies from a previous infection inadvertently assist a new strain of the virus in entering immune cells and replicating. Unlike diseases where immunity provides protection against reinfection, dengue’s various strains complicate the immune response. Normally, our immune systems retain memory of past infections, enabling swift responses.Dengue has four different strains, and even though we become immune to the one we were infected with, that immunity might not last long against the other three. This means the risk of getting dengue again, especially during an outbreak, is high.Dengue fever is endemic in the Philippines. The risk of transmission is highest during and immediately following the rainy season, which typically occurs May-November. Dengue fever is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. The risk of infection is often highest in urban and semi-urban areas. Health authorities have reported elevated dengue fever activity in multiple areas in Central Visayas (Region VII), with 6,539 total cases reported in January 1 to May 25, 2024. This is compared to the 3,246 cases reported during a similar period in 2023. Bohol (2,434 cases) is the most affected, followed by Cebu (1,900 cases), Negros Oriental (1,086 cases), and Siquijor (282 cases). Local health officials urge the public and local government to prepare for the surge in dengue fever cases in the coming months by remaining vigilant, keeping surroundings clean, and clearing potential mosquito breeding sites.The Department of Health (DOH) is vigilant against a potential surge in dengue cases with the onset of the rainy season, expected to be intensified by La Niña. DOH emphasized the importance of remaining cautious as the weather transitions.The Importance of Personal Risk RecognitionIn the fight against dengue fever, the collective efforts of governments are undeniably vital. However, the importance of personal risk recognition cannot be overstated. Individuals play a crucial role in protecting themselves and their loved ones from this mosquito-borne disease by understanding and actively addressing the factors that contribute to dengue transmission.Personal risk recognition begins with education and awareness. By familiarizing themselves with the symptoms of dengue fever – such as high fever, severe headache, joint and muscle pain, and rash – individuals can detect the disease early and seek timely medical intervention. Early detection is key to effective treatment and can prevent the progression to severe dengue.Another essential aspect of personal risk recognition is the identification and elimination of mosquito breeding sites. Stagnant water in containers, flowerpots, and discarded tires are common breeding grounds for mosquitoes. By regularly inspecting and removing these potential breeding sites in and around their homes, individuals can significantly reduce mosquito populations and curb the spread of dengue.In addition to proactive measures to eliminate breeding sites, practicing preventive measures is crucial in reducing the risk of mosquito bites. This includes wearing long sleeves and pants, using mosquito repellents, and installing screens on windows and doors to prevent mosquitoes from entering living spaces. These simple yet effective strategies can help individuals minimize their exposure to mosquitoes, especially during peak mosquito activity periods.Equally important is the prompt seeking of medical care upon recognizing dengue symptoms. Timely medical attention is essential for early diagnosis and appropriate management of the disease. By seeking medical care promptly, individuals can receive the necessary treatment to prevent complications and reduce the risk of severe dengue. By understanding the importance of early symptom recognition, eliminating mosquito breeding sites, practicing preventive measures, and seeking timely medical care, individuals can empower themselves to protect against dengue and contribute to the collective effort in combating this disease.Ongoing efforts by the government, supported by community programs, are crucial in the fight to prevent dengue. These initiatives focus on expanding educational campaigns and providing accessible tools and resources. Among these resources is “Iwas Dengue,” a dedicated platform aimed at heightening awareness about dengue fever. By enhancing educational opportunities and leveraging platforms like “Iwas Dengue,” individuals can become better equipped to recognize and mitigate dengue risks, thereby strengthening community resilience against this persistent threat.The pressing need for collaboration and innovation is evident as we delve into the complexities of dengue infection. The first-ever Dengue Summit provides a platform to address these challenges head-on, advocating for new technologies like vaccination and innovative solutions to combat this relentless disease. It’s not just about responding to outbreaks; it’s about proactively preventing them and safeguarding communities against future threats.The Dengue Summit aims to be an influential event. To align with United Nation’s Sustainable Goal 3, the summit is a crucial step towards a future where “Zero Dengue Deaths by 2030” becomes a reality. With over 121 medical societies joining forces under the Philippine Medical Association (PMA), alongside more than 40 private partners, this summit is a testament to the collective determination to combat dengue. The aim is clear: to strengthen the integrated efforts of national and local governments in controlling outbreaks and preventing dengue-related fatalities. The urgency of this mission cannot be overstated, especially in light of the alarming statistics showing a spike in dengue cases.Together, through collective effort and educational initiatives, we can turn the tide against dengue, ensuring a healthier and safer future for all."

Herbosa who is the PhilHealth) Board chairman, upon direction of President Marcos made it the priority of the PhilHealth Board of Directors to increase the corporation’s package rate for hemodialysis as suggested also by Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez.The PhilHealth Board, upon recommendation of the Benefits Committee oficer -in-charge, Health Assistant Secretary Albert Domingo, approved the increase to P4,000.This, the DOH said, aligns with the Second State of the Nation Address (Sona) of the President, where he stated that dialysis is now free for the majority of Filipinos.Consequently, the President’s vision encompasses not only end-stage treatments, but also preventive care and early detection of diseases like diabetes and hypertension that lead to Chronic Kidney Disease, the department said in the statement.Likewise, the DOH is also developing PuroKalusugan with the goal to enhance healthcare at the community level.On their end, PhilHealth is also improving financial coverage for Primary Care through another iteration of the regular nationwide Konsulta package, aiming for a higher capitation rate, giving incentives for early disease detection and prevention services.“We are encouraged by the guidance of President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., and House Speaker Martin G. Romualdez to pursue safe, high-quality, and people-centered services for all Filipinos. The threat of kidney disease requires support not just in end-stage treatment, but in its prevention and early detection as well. These initiatives bring each Filipino closer to accessing the highest quality healthcare at the lowest cost dahil sa Bagong Pilipinas, Bawat Buhay Mahalaga,” said Herbosa.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/24/unplugged-childhoods-how-european-parents-are-resisting-smartphone-pressures/,UNPLUGGED CHILDHOODS: How European parents are resisting smartphone pressures,"BARCELONA, Spain—Try saying “no” when a child asks for a smartphone. What comes after, parents everywhere can attest, begins with some variation of: “Everyone has one. Why can’t I?”But what if no pre-teen in sight has one—and what if having a smartphone was weird? That’s the endgame of an increasing number of parents across Europe who are concerned by evidence that smartphone use among young kids jeopardizes their safety and mental health—and share the conviction that there’s strength in numbers.From Spain to Britain and Ireland, parents are flooding WhatsApp and Telegram groups with plans not just to keep smartphones out of schools, but to link arms and refuse to buy young kids the devices before—or even into—their teenage years.After being inspired by a conversation in a Barcelona park with other moms, Elisabet García Permanyer started a chat group last fall to share information on the perils of Internet access for children with families at her kids’ school.The group, called “Adolescence Free of Mobile Phones,” quickly expanded to other schools and then across the entire country to now include over 10,000 members. The most engaged parents have formed pairs of activists in schools across Spain and are pushing for fellow parents to agree not to get their kids smartphones until they are 16. After organizing online, they facilitate real-world talks among concerned parents to further their crusade.“When I started this, I just hoped I would find four other families who thought like me, but it took off and kept growing, growing and growing,” García Permanyer says. “My goal was to try to join forces with other parents so we could push back the point when smartphones arrive. I said, ‘I am going to try so that my kids are not the only ones who don’t have one.’”It isn’t just parents.Police and public health experts were sounding the alarm about a spike of violent and pornographic videos being witnessed by children via handheld devices. Spain’s government took note of the momentum and banned smartphones entirely from elementary schools in January. Now they can only be turned on in high school, which starts at age 12, if a teacher deems it necessary for an educational activity.“If we adults are addicted to smartphones, how can we give one to a 12-year-old who doesn’t have the ability to handle it?” García Permanyer asks. “This has gotten away from us. If the Internet were a safe space for children, then it would be fine. But it isn’t.”The movement in Britain gained steam this year after the mother of 16-year-old Brianna Ghey, who was killed by two teenagers last year, began demanding that kids under 16 be blocked from accessing social media on smartphones.“It feels like we all know [buying smartphones] is a bad decision for our kids, but that the social norm has not yet caught up,” Daisy Greenwell, a Suffolk, England-area mother of three kids under age 10, posted to her Instagram earlier this year. “What if we could switch the social norm so that in our school, our town, our country, it was an odd choice to make to give your child a smartphone at 11? What if we could hold off until they’re 14, or 16?”She and a friend, Clare Reynolds, set up a WhatsApp group called Parents United for a Smartphone-Free Childhood, with three people on it. She posted an invitation on her Instagram page. Within four days, 2,000 people had joined the group, requiring Greenwell and Reynolds to split off dozens of groups by locality. Three weeks after the original post, there was a chat group for every British county, one of the organizers said on WhatsApp.Parents rallying to ban smartphones from young children have a long way to go to change what’s considered “normal.”By the time they’re 12, most children have smartphones, statistics from all three countries show. Look a little closer, and the numbers get starker: In Spain, a quarter of children have a cellphone by age 10, and almost half by 11. At 12, this share rises to 75 percent. British media regulator Ofcom said 55 percent of kids in the UK owned a smartphone between ages 8 and 11, with the figure rising to 97 percent at age 12.Ofcom added another statistic to their report last year: One in five toddlers, ages 3 or 4, owns a smartphone.Parents and schools that have succeeded in flipping the paradigm in their communities told The Associated Press the change became possible the moment they understood that they were not alone. What started as a tool to keep in touch with buddies has morphed into something more worrisome to keep away from kids—akin, these parents assert, to things like cigarettes and alcohol.In Greystones, Ireland, that moment came after all eight primary school principals in town signed and posted a letter last May that discouraged parents from buying their students smartphones. Then the parents themselves voluntarily signed written pledges, promising to refrain from letting their kids have the devices.“The discussion went away almost overnight,” says Christina Capatina, 38, a Greystones parent of two preteen daughters who signed the pledge and says there are almost no smartphones in schools this academic year. “If [kids] even ask now, you tell them: We’re just following the rules. That’s how we live.”For Mònica Marquès of Barcelona, no signed pledge was necessary to get the same result. She polled the parents of her daughters’ grade two years ago and she was surprised to see that “99% of them were as terrified or more so than I was.”She shared the results of her questionnaire, and says that this year, when her daughter started high school, not one student in her grade had a smartphone.And as for that other excuse that kids supposedly need a smartphone so parents can keep tabs on them, Marquès says an old-school cell phone without Internet access like the one her daughter carries is a perfect substitute.Something like a consensus has built for years among institutions, governments, parents and others that smartphone use by children is linked to bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children’s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.The push to control smartphones in Spain comes amid a surge in notorious cases of children viewing online pornography, sharing videos of sexual violence, or even participating in creating “deep fake” pornographic images of female classmat es using generative artificial intelligence tools. Spain’s government says that 25 percent of kids 12 and under and 50 percent of kids 15 and under have already been exposed to online pornography. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Spain is facing an “authentic epidemic” of pornography targeted at minors.The threats include adults taking advantage of minors they meet online, such as the recent arrest of two “influencers” in Madrid for having allegedly sexually assaulted underage girls who followed them on TikTok.The dangers have produced school bans on smartphones and online safety laws. But those don’t address what kids do in off hours.“What I try to emphasize to other principals is the importance of joining up with the school next door to you,” says Rachel Harper, principal of St. Patrick’s National School, one of the eight in Greystones to encourage parents to refrain from smartphones for their kids. “There’s a bit more strength that way, in that all the parents in the area are talking about it.”The parents’ concerns are diverse. Some fear the day when their young kids ask to get a phone like their friends. Others have young teens with phones and regret they followed the herd during what they consider a naïve phase when screens were just a way to let kids have fun and chat with their friends. Parents speak of having emerged from a state of blissful ignorance about the internet.The home isolation of the Covid-19 pandemic offered a firsthand glimpse of their kids staring at screens and getting clever about hiding what they were seeing there—and what was finding them.“The screens were seen as a escape valve that let adults work and kept kids occupied, whatever that meant,” says Macu Cristófol, who started a group of concerned parents in Malaga, in southern Spain, after she heard of the ballooning parents group in Barcelona. “That was when I thought, where are we going? We have become hostages of screens.”Capatina says she saw her 11-year-old daughter change the day she came home from a playground and shared that a girl there had recorded video of the scene on a smartphone.“Panic, panic, panic,” Capatina recalls of her daughter’s reaction. “Nothing really major happened,” Capatina says, “but I saw the pressure and anxiety levels increasing where they hadn’t before. And I thought, that’s not healthy. Children shouldn’t have to worry about things like that.”But if the kids can’t have smartphones, are the parents cutting back their own online time? That’s tough, multiple parents say, because they’re managing families and work online. Capatina, an interior designer, says she shows her kids what she’s been doing online—work, for example, or schedules—“to hold myself accountable.”Laura Borne, a Greystones mom of kids ages 5 and 6 who have never known smartphones, says she is aware of the need to model online behavior—and that she should probably cut back.“I’m trying my best,” she says. But just as with the children she parents, the pressures are there. And they’re not going away.Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/21/gene-therapy-may-cure-rare-diseases-but-drugmakers-have-few-incentives-leaving-families-desperate/,"Gene therapy may cure rare diseases. But drugmakers have few incentives, leaving families desperate","Robin Alderman faces an agonizing reality: Gene therapy might cure her son Camden’s rare, inherited immune deficiency. But it’s not available to him.In 2022, London-based Orchard Therapeutics stopped investing in an experimental treatment for the condition, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. And there are no gene therapy studies he can join.“We feel like we are the forgotten,” said Alderman, who’s advocated for her 21-year-old son since he was a baby.Collectively, about 350 million people worldwide suffer from rare diseases, most of which are genetic. But each of the 7,000 individual disorders affects perhaps a few in a million people or less. There’s little commercial incentive to develop or bring to market these one-time therapies to fix faulty genes or replace them with healthy ones. This leaves families like the Aldermans scrambling for help and some trying to raise money themselves for cures that may never come.“These kids have been unfortunate twice: A, because they got a genetic disease, and B, because the disease is so rare that nobody cares,” said Dr. Giulio Cossu, a professor of regenerative medicine at the University of Manchester in England. “Companies want to make a profit.”Scientists say this dynamic threatens to thwart progress in the nascent gene therapy field, erasing the potential of a new type of medicine just as a steady stream of research points toward promising treatments for various disorders. Researchers are seeking solutions, often turning to charitable organizations, patient groups and governments.A major Italian charity announced in February that it’s taking over the Wiskott-Aldrich treatment Orchard had been pursuing. And an arm of the charitable Foundation Fighting Blindness helped launch a company, Opus Genetics, to advance gene therapy work by University of Pennsylvania researcher Dr. Jean Bennett and a colleague.In many ways, that effort was inspired by patients’ families.“Some of them have bake sales. One family mortgaged their house to give some money for a study for their rare disease,” Bennett said. “I just feel responsible to help them.”The Aldermans have faced years of pain and frustration.Camden Alderman was diagnosed as a baby with Wiskott-Aldrich, caused by a mutated gene on the X chromosome. It primarily affects boys – up to 10 out of every million — and can cause frequent infections, eczema and excessive bleeding.When he was a toddler, doctors removed his spleen because of uncontrolled bleeding. As a young boy, he wound up in the hospital many times and was told he couldn’t play baseball.One treatment is a bone marrow transplant. But he is Black and has Korean heritage, making it difficult to find a donor — people are most likely to match with someone of similar ancestral or ethnic backgrounds. Robin Alderman recalls one doctor saying: “Basically, your son’s only chance at a cure is going to be gene therapy.”He also told her researchers weren’t then accepting U.S. residents into a clinical trial, which “just kind of broke my heart,” she said.Today, Camden Alderman is a rising senior at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. He takes penicillin daily and gives himself weekly immunoglobulin infusions under his skin, which help fight infection. Still, he’s landed in the hospital a few times in recent years and has developed a kidney problem.While he doesn’t view gene therapy as a cure-all, he said, “it would just help me kind of lead an easier life.”That’s proved true for patients who underwent the experimental therapy, such as Dr. Priya Stephen’s 14-year-old son, who participated in a clinical trial in Italy that accepted Americans at the time.While Stephen is grateful, she said, she can’t help feeling guilty that her family got an opportunity others don’t: “It’s ethically just not acceptable to have a treatment that we know works, that we know is safe, that people all of a sudden can’t access.”For a while, it seemed gene therapy for Wiskott-Aldrich was on track for wider availability. Genethon, a French nonprofit research organization, sponsored promising clinical trials but didn’t have funding to continue development, CEO Frédéric Revah said.Drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline transferred another therapy to Orchard, which announced in 2019 that it had secured a designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration meant to speed up development and review. But Orchard discontinued investment in this and two other rare-disease treatments a couple of years ago, with CEO Dr. Bobby Gaspar saying the company sympathized with affected families and would look for other ways to advance the therapies.“There’s a huge number of diseases out there that could benefit from gene therapy but for which there is no profitability model because the investment for research is high, the cost of production is high and the number of patients is very low,” Revah said.Most genetic conditions are rare — each affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. at any given time. Research hasn’t made it past early stages for many of them.Lacey Henderson’s daughter, 5-year-old Estella, has alternating hemiplegia of childhood, a neurological condition that affects 300 people in the U.S. Estella is cognitively delayed, has limited use of her hands and becomes temporarily paralyzed in part or all of her body, Henderson said. Medications can curb symptoms, but there’s no cure.Her Iowa family fundraises through a GoFundMe and a website to develop a gene therapy. They’ve brought in around $200,000.“We have three different projects with various researchers,” Henderson said. “But the problem is everything is underfunded.”Financial disincentives plague the process, from drug discovery to development, scientists say.The amount of work to get from a lab to human testing and through the drug-approval process is “incredibly expensive,” said Dr. Donald Kohn, professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at the University of California, Los Angeles.In the last couple of years, he said, gene-therapy investment has largely dried up.“If you have to spend $20 million or $30 million to get approval and you have five or 10 patients a year, it’s hard to get a return on investment,” Kohn said. “So we have successful, safe therapies, but it’s more the financial, economic elements that are limiting them from becoming approved drugs.”Ultimately, most biotechnology companies become public and must focus on shareholder profit, said Francois Vigneault, CEO of the Seattle biotech Shape Therapeutics.“The board is the thing that gets in the way; they’re trying to maximize gain,” said Vigneault, whose company is privately held. “That’s just greed. That’s just incentive misaligned between corporate company structure and what we should do that’s good for the world.”Even when treatments make it to market, they might not stay there. The same year Orchard stopped investing in the Wiskott-Aldrich treatment, it also stopped distributing a drug called Strimvelis, approved in Europe to treat the rare disease ADA-SCID, or “bubble boy syndrome.”Claire Booth, professor of gene therapy and pediatric immunology at University College London, is among those working for change. She co-founded Access to Gene Therapies for Rare Disease, which brings together people across Europe representing academic groups, patient advocates, regulators, funders and drugmakers. They hope to create an independent nonprofit that can support market authorization and access to therapies that aren’t commercially sustainable.A related effort in the U.S., The Bespoke Gene Therapy Consortium, was organized by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health and includes the FDA, various NIH institutes, and several drug companies and nonprofits. The group’s goals include supporting a handful of clinical trials and exploring ways to streamline regulatory processes.Some researchers are trying to address the problem scientifically. Dr. Anna Greka said the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard has launched an effort to look at commonalities behind various conditions — or nodes, which can be likened to branches meeting at a tree trunk. Fixing the nodes with gene therapies or other treatments, rather than particular “misspellings” in DNA responsible for one disorder, could address multiple diseases simultaneously.“What this does is it increases the number of patients who can benefit from the therapy,” said Greka, a Broad member. “It also makes it infinitely easier or more attractive to anyone, like a biopharmaceutical company, to take the project forward and try to bring it toward the clinic, because they’re going to have a bigger market.”Meanwhile, affected families are partnering with each other and scientists to help move the needle. Genethon was created by an association of patients and their relatives to develop treatments for several rare diseases. And a leader of the foundation involved in Opus Genetics has a child with a rare genetic retinal disease.There’s also new hope for families dealing with Wiskott-Aldrich and bubble boy disease. Last year, the Telethon Foundation in Italy took on responsibility of producing and distributing Strimvelis. This year, the charity announced it was selected for a pilot program of the European Medicines Agency that could help guide its Wiskott-Aldrich gene therapy through the regulatory process there.Still, scientists say these efforts don’t negate the larger financial quandary surrounding therapies for rare diseases, and it may be a while before such genetic treatments are available to patients worldwide.“This is a massive challenge, and I’m not entirely sure we’re going to be able to overcome it,” Booth said. “But we have to give it a go because we’ve spent decades and millions making these transformative treatments. And if we don’t try, then it feels like the end of an era.”"

With summer kicking-in, students who are on vacation from school have less to do. As such, they should have productive activities to keep them busy and constantly hone their minds to prevent them from getting bored. Licensed psychologist Heather Lyons, Ph.D. points out that “prolonged stretches of boredom can lead to higher stress levels. Chronic boredom can increase your risk factors for mental health issues, leading to negative thinking patterns, impulsivity, and self-destructive behaviors.” is the newest exhibit at the Art Cove, Park Inn by Radisson Bacolod’s built-in art space. This is the eighth installation of the gallery, featuring the works of Ms. Sheila Marie Basio, marking her third solo exhibition. Ms. Basio hails from the city of Escalante, Negros Occidental. She is a retired teacher, meditator, yogini, and an active mindfulness advocate. Her works represent her battles with mental illness, self-empowerment, and choosing life over defeat. “Art has always been a medium for expression, and through these works, I have attempted to capture the complexities, struggles, and triumphs associated with mental health. Each piece tells a story—sometimes of despair, sometimes of hope, but always of resilience,” said Ms. Basio.Her artworks address mental health as a topic that touches everyone, whether directly or indirectly, and she hopes this exhibition sparks conversations, evokes empathy, and offers solace to those who might be struggling in silence. “Here at Art Cove, we consider ourselves privileged to host such a profound and timely exhibit. In an age where the importance of mental health cannot be overstated, through Ms. Sheila’s art, we are encouraged to appreciate beauty and embrace the full range of our shared human experience,” said Archie Javellana, Park Inn by Radisson Bacolod’s Rooms Division Manager.The ribbon-cutting last June 5 was led by the Tales of the Psyche artist, Ms. Sheila Marie Basio, with honorable guests Art Association of Bacolod–Negros Treasurer Patty Jane Ku Ong, City Councilor of Victorias Hon. Joji Larraga, and was assisted by Park Inn by Radisson Bacolod’s Rooms Division Manager, Mr. Archie Javellana. The exhibit was also graced by the presence of Mr. Charlie Co, co-owner of Orange Project and a Filipino contemporary visual artist known for works with a strong socio-realist theme.

We must now prepare our societies for the next public health emergency. Being truly prepared, therefore, means being ready to prevent, respond and recover, and to learn lessons for next time.”In the report, IFRC Secretary-General Jagan Chapagain pointed out that preparedness is based on the principles of trust, equity, and local action.Speaking at the forum, IFRC president Kate Forbes acknowledged PRC’s successful fight against the pandemic. “Our previous model of technical support and asset deployment from the Federation and other National Societies…was no longer effective. We needed to change. We needed to rewrite our playbook. This is where the Philippine Red Cross led the way. It is the case study for success in connecting with and empowering local communities. The Philippine Red Cross has been successful at working in local communities for decades. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the Philippine Red Cross had the tools, resources, and network to help communities. As you can read in the report, the PRC anticipated the needs of communities, it leveraged their trust, and implemented local action that kept communities safe.”PRC Chairman and CEO Richard J. Gordon recalled how the support of PRC’s corporate partners and its 2 million volunteers allowed the Philippines’ largest humanitarian organization to save lives amid the onslaught of Covid-19. He said: “We have it in us as a country…to meet every challenge, bear every burden or suffering. But when we get together, especially when we have leaders we can follow, and instead of saying it’s not my problem, we say I’ll be part of the solution…”Other speakers at the forum were PRC Secretary-General Dr. Gwen Pang, UN Philippines Resident coordinator Gustavo Gonzales, Australian Embassy in the Philippines Counsellor Thanh Le, IFRC Asia Pacific Regional Director Alexander Matheou, and IFRC Philippine Delegation Program Coordinator Gopal Mukherjee.The forum panelists included Dr. Paulyn Jean Ubial, Molecular Laboratory Head of PRC’s Covid-19 Response; Dr. Charlotte Chiong, Dean of the University of the Philippines College of Medicine; Dr. Maria Clarissa Alejandro, CEO of Healthway QualiMed; Ms. Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov, Unicef representative to the Philippines; and Australian Embassy’s Dr. Thanh Le.

Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) indicate that road traffic deaths increased by 39 percent from 7,938 deaths in 2011 to 11,096 deaths in 2021.The Metro Manila Accident Reporting and Analysis System (MMARAS), meanwhile, revealed an alarming rate of approximately 92,583 road crashes annually over the past decade, resulting in an average of 410 deaths each year. Among these fatalities, 51 percent are drivers, 36 percent are pedestrians, and 13 percent are passengers. These statistics emphasize the urgent need for enhanced road safety measures to protect all road users and reduce the number of preventable deaths.The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and its partners recently conducted a three-day stakeholders’ meeting to formulate the Metro Manila Road Safety Action Plan (MMRSAP) 2024-2028. The MMRSAP 2024-2028 will serve as the framework for the region’s road safety efforts, aiming to reduce road crash fatalities by 35 percent by 2028.Supported by the Department of Transportation (DOTr), WHO Philippines, and The Policy Center (TPC), this activity is part of the celebration for the Philippine Road Safety Month.Representatives from Metro Manila’s local government units (LGUs) and technical experts from various agencies, including the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), Department of Health (DOH), Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), Land Transportation Office (LTO), Philippine National Police-National Capital Region Police Office (PNP-NCRPO), Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG), and University of the Philippines-National Center for Transportation Studies (UP-NCTS), convened to strategize the development of the plan.The stakeholders focused on crucial aspects of the MMRSAP, emphasizing the five pillars of road safety: road safety management, safer roads, safer vehicles, safer road users, and post-crash response.MMDA Assistant General Manager for Planning OIC Atty. Victor Pablo Trinidad, in his message on behalf of MMDA Acting Chairman Romando Artes said, “The contributions and insights from representatives from NGOs and LGUs have deeply enriched the discussions on the challenges of preserving road safety and the exploration of essential strategies and initiatives to enhance the bustling metropolis.”“Inspired by our discussions and dialogue, we are poised to forge ahead in crafting a comprehensive action plan that will pave the way for safer and more efficient road systems in Metro Manila.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/05/30/philhealth-increases-benefits-for-neonatal-sepsis-bronchial-asthma/,"PhilHealth increases benefits for neonatal sepsis, bronchial asthma","Effective May 1, 2024, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) is implementing another round of enhancements in two of its existing benefit packages, this time for neonatal sepsis and bronchial asthma which have been increased heftily by more than 100 percent. PhilHealth Circulars 2024-0008 and 0009, the implementing guidelines of these two case rate packages, prescribe that all patients admitted on May 1, 2024 onwards may avail themselves of the increased benefits in accredited health facilities. According to PhilHealth President and CEO Emmanuel R. Ledesma Jr. “the PhilHealth Board has approved the increase in package rate for neonatal sepsis to P25,793 from P11,700 and bronchial asthma in acute exacerbation to P22,488 from P9,000. The increase translates to 120 percent and 150 percent, respectively.” Neonatal sepsis and other infectious conditions are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths in the Philippines. In 2023, PhilHealth paid P733.86 million for more than 57,000 cases for the condition. On the other hand, asthma remains to be a high burden ailment in the Philippines despite medical advancements. The majority of Filipinos with asthma do not have adequate control over their conditions, resulting in confinements. Based on PhilHealth data for 2023, asthma ranks eight among the top medical confinements paid by the state insurer, where P717 million have been paid for, more than 90,000 cases of asthma.PhilHealth identified neonatal sepsis and bronchial asthma as priority conditions in rationalizing its All Case Rates packages to further improve financial coverage and lower, if not eradicate the patients out-of-pocket expenses. Ledesma explained that “PhilHeatlh is continuously improving its benefit packages in line with our thrust ‘Pinalawak at mga Bagong Benepisyo para sa Mamamayang Filipino.’ We are hoping that these enhancements bring positive impact in the behavior of the Filipinos seeking medical attention. Those who need medical attention should not think twice about seeking help because PhilHealth will help you with your medical expenses.”PhilHealth also reminded the members that the adjusted case rates may be availed of in Levels 1 to 3 accredited public and private health facilities nationwide. Meanwhile, the previous rates of P11,700 for neonatal sepsis and P9,000 for bronchial asthma will be applied to patients admitted in accredited primary care facilities.The state agency also emphasized the important role that primary care plays in disease prevention and early detection. It has again called on primary care facilities to be Konsulta Package Providers (KPP) to provide wider access to drugs and medicines for the control of asthma. “Since our accredited KPP provides consultations, drugs and medicines and laboratory tests, hospital admission due to worsening of asthma will be avoided”, Ledesma added. The PhilHealth Chief also urged all members to register with their preferred to Konsulta Package Provider to avail themselves of free consultations, health screening and assessment, as well as any of the 21 essential drugs and medicines and 13 laboratory tests as will be required by their primary care physician."

This includes, PAV stressed, banning flavored vapes and ensuring that packaging does not attract minors.Likewise, PAV is deeply troubled by the recent press release from the Department of Health (DOH) highlighting a 110 percent increase in vape users in 2023. “Particularly alarming is the statistic that one in every seven young teenagers, aged 13 to 15, is now using vape products. This, despite the fact that, under Republic Act 11900, only those 18 years old and above are supposed to have access to vapes,” PAV added. With this, PAV called for an amendment of the Vape Law or Republic Act 11900 by:Increasing the age of accessibility from 18 to 21. Twenty-one was the accessibility age prior to Republic Act 11900. Because the Vape Law lowered the age of access from 21 to 18, more youth now have access to it. Limit flavors to two: menthol and tobacco. If vape is being marketed as a cessation tool, then there is no need to make it attractive and appealing especially to our children. Traditional cigarettes only have menthol and tobacco flavors so there is no need to have other flavors.Return the regulatory power over vapes to the Food and Drug Administration. Anything that you put into your body should be regulated by the FDA, not by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).“Vaping is not a safe alternative to smoking. It poses significant health risks, especially to the developing lungs and brains of our children. The recent cases of Evali or E-cigarette or vaping use-associated lung injury only prove one most glaring fact: vaping kills!” PAV reiterated.The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier said that tobacco companies still actively target young people via social media, sports and music festivals and new, flavored products, accusing companies of trying to hook a new generation on nicotine.As stricter regulations targeting cigarettes are in place, big tobacco companies and new entrants have begun offering smoking alternatives such as vapes, which they say are aimed at adult smokers.But WHO said these products are often marketed to the youth, their design and variety of fruity flavors appeal to children, and that young people are more likely to use the products than adults in many countries.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu rejected the industry’s claim that it is working to reduce the harm from smoking. “It’s dishonest to talk about harm reduction when they are marketing to children,” he said.Vape products are often marketed in a way that appeals to young people, with flavors like candy and fruit, and sleek, high-tech designs. Flavors entice children. PAV noted an article published by the VeraFiles about two years ago which claimed, that vape products “have more than 15,000 flavors in the country.” “This is a deliberate tactic by the vaping industry to hook a new generation on nicotine,” PAV lamented.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

It received a Gold Seal in the same segment in 2023.Such achievement is attributable to Smart Traveller, which includes coverage for loss or damaged baggage, flight delays, personal accidents, and emergency medical expenses. Also, it’s Schengen-accredited with 24/7 travel assistance and the highest medical coverage for emergencies for up to P3.5 million, anywhere in the world. THE insurer was also feted with Gold Seals for both Health and Life Insurance categories. This was the second consecutive year for the former segment, thanks to its medical plan, Global Health Access, that provides best-in-class, worldwide coverage for both treatment and executive check-ups that take a comprehensive look at the plan holder’s physical health, including diagnosing critical illnesses. It also offers health coverage of up to P175 million. An affordable local health plan, Health Care Access, gives up to P5 million coverage for hospitalization, outpatient, emergency as well as preventive care needs. AXA also offers critical illness plans such as Health Max, Health Start, and Health Start Lite—each tailored to specific needs and covers major and minor conditions. These offerings provide cash benefits for treatment and income loss, allowing the insured and their family to focus on full recovery.For the first time, the firm earned a Gold Seal for the insurance category, with its all-around insurance plan, MyLifeChoice, aimed at giving breadwinners all the financial protection they need as they pursue their multiple responsibilities, sans the need to sacrifice one goal over another. It comes with life insurance coverage that has cash benefits in the event of the insured’s untimely demise, accident and disability coverage, and critical illness coverage that prepares individuals for financial setbacks. On top of everything, this plan opens investment opportunities to help them build funds that can support their long-term goals.“We are truly proud to be consistently recognized by Filipino consumers as a trusted brand,” said Nandy Villar, chief marketing officer at AXA Philippines. “These awards are an affirmation of the work we are doing to fulfill our commitment to delivering exceptional customer service and innovative insurance solutions that reflect our purpose to act for human progress by protecting what matters.”The Reader’s Digest Trusted Brands Awards is conducted entirely by third party, Catalyst Research. Its survey is answered by a large sampling of real consumers, with thousands of Filipinos across the country participating. The Philippines is one of five countries in the region surveyed, the others being Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The survey is done on 45 brand categories, cutting across a broad range of industries. Brands are rated by 8,000 respondents on these six key attributes: Trustworthiness and Credibility, Quality, Value, Understanding of Customer Needs, Innovation, and Social Responsibility. A Gold Seal is given to brands that outscore their competitors significantly in their category, while a Platinum Seal is given to category toppers, with a clear and significant margin over other brands in their line."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/05/30/hpv-vaccines-prevent-cancer-in-men-as-well-as-women-new-research-suggests/,"HPV vaccines prevent cancer in men as well as women, new research suggests","New research suggests the HPV vaccine is preventing cancer in men, as well as in women, but fewer boys than girls are getting the shots in the United States.The HPV vaccine was developed to prevent cervical cancer in women and experts give it credit, along with screening, for Evidence that the shots are preventing HPV-related cancers in men has been slower to emerge, but the new research suggests vaccinated men have fewer cancers of the compared to those who didn’t get the shots. These cancers are more than twice as common in men than in women.For the study, researchers compared 3.4 million people of similar ages—half vaccinated versus half unvaccinated—in a large health care dataset.As expected, vaccinated women had a lower risk of developing cervical cancer within at least five years of getting the shots. For men, there were benefits too. Vaccinated men had a lower risk of developing any HPV-related cancer, such as cancers of the anus, penis and mouth and throat.These cancers take years to develop so the numbers were low: There were 57 HPV-related cancers among the unvaccinated men—mostly head and neck cancers — compared to 26 among the men who had the HPV vaccine.“We think the maximum benefit from the vaccine will actually happen in the next two or three decades,” said study co-author Dr. Joseph Curry, a head and neck surgeon at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center in Philadelphia. “What we’re showing here is an early wave of effect.”Results of the study and a second were released last week by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and will be discussed next month at its annual meeting in Chicago. The second study shows vaccination rates rising but males lag behind females in getting the HPV shots.HPV, or human papillomavirus, is very common and is spread through sex. Most HPV infections cause no symptoms and clear up without treatment. Others develop into cancer, about 37,000 cases a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In the US, the HPV vaccine has been recommended since 2006 for girls at age 11 or 12, and since 2011 for boys the same age. Catch-up shots are recommended for anyone through age 26 who hasn’t been vaccinated.In the second study, researchers looked at self- and parent-reported HPV vaccination rates in preteens and young adults in a large government survey. From 2011 to 2020, vaccination rates rose from 38 percent to 49 percent among females, and among males from 8 percent to 36 percent.“HPV vaccine uptake among young males increased by more than fourfold over the last decade, though vaccination rates among young males still fall behind females,” said study co-author Dr. Danh Nguyen at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.Parents of boys, as well as girls, should know that HPV vaccines lower cancer risk, said Jasmin Tiro of the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center who was not involved in the research. And young men who haven’t been vaccinated can still get the shots.“It’s really important that teenagers get exposed to the vaccine before they’re exposed to the virus,” she said."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/05/30/cervical-cancer-free-phl-is-impossible-if-hpv-vax-coverage-remains-low/,‘Cervical cancer-free’ PHL is impossible if HPV vax coverage remains low,"IMMUNIZATION against cervical cancer in the Philippines remains low, an educator said, warning that if this trend continues, the country’s target to become free from the second most frequent cancer among women aged 15 to 44 will not be attainable even by the end of this century. This dreaded disease remains a significant public health threat nationwide, claiming the lives of at least 12 Filipinas each day and putting almost 40 million females at risk of developing this illness. Ironically, this should not be the case since 99 percent of cervical cancer cases are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which can be prevented via HPV immunization of women as early as nine years old.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), eliminating the growth of cells that starts in the cervix of the female populace is achievable within the next decade should all nations reach and maintain an incidence rate below four per 100,000 women by 2030.This goal rests on three key pillars: vaccinating 90 percent of girls with the HPV vaccine by age 15, screening 70 percent of women with high-performance tests by ages 35 and 45 and treating 90 percent of women with pre-cancer and invasive cancer.Unfortunately, this is very ambitious because research shows that it will take time for the Philippines to become cervical cancer-free.“For the Philippines most of the studies show that we can eliminate cervical cancer between 2071 to 2098. Although there have been estimates as well that indicate that we can eliminate cervical cancer by 2064 using different equation in their models,” Frances Ngo of University of the Philippines Manila’s National Institutes of Health (NIH) said during the 1st Philippine Cervical Cancer Elimination Summit, titled “One Community Against HPV,” held recently at the Novotel Hotel in Cubao, Quezon City.In the vaccination model, the 9-valent vaccine is used globally, but is not being utilized in the country’s HPV vaccination campaign at present, she noted. Another study, she cited, shows that multiple age cohorts are used here, “meaning we are not only vaccinating nine year old girls, [but] we’re also vaccinating 10- to 14-year-old girls during the first year of program implementation.”The screening model, on the other hand, involves primary methods, such as visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), pap smear, and DNA screening.“But what are readily available in the country are VIA and vaccine,” Ngo said.Screening cervical cancer through primary VIA testing is recommended in the Philippines. Nevertheless, coverage is reportedly low. While HPV vaccination has been available across the country since 2016, widescale coverage has not yet been achieved nationwide.In fact, she cited that only four percent and one percent of the target female population nationwide are vaccinated with first and second doses respectively of HPV vaccines. To reach the elimination targets, organized national programs for both HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening and treatment must be implemented, alongside the strengthening of competencies of health workforce across all three pillars for long-term success on the path towards cervical cancer-free Philippines.The national government spent a staggering P46.63 billion on cancer treatment in 2020. Despite subsidies, however, a typical Filipino household dealing with cancer still pays 15 to 41 percent of out-of-pocket medical costs.This underscores the tragic reality that countless lives and resources are being lost needlessly from cervical cancer.“We cannot reach the target between 2071 to 2098 if we will not be doing the [above mentioned] ’90-70-90’ strategy [of WHO],” Ngo pointed out.She even cautioned that if the country’s HPV vaccination campaign remains on status quo, “we will not be eliminating cervical cancer within this century.”Based on projections, a total of 449,473 Filipinas will die from cervical cancer without any intervention by 2070 and 1,186,759 by 2120."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/05/30/asian-hospital-opens-florence-lim-chan-nursing-simulation-lab/,Asian Hospital opens Florence Lim-Chan Nursing Simulation Lab,"Asian Hospital and Medical Center is taking nursing care and healthcare excellence to the next level with the opening of the Florence Lim-Chan Simulation Lab on May 21, 2024. Located on the 7th floor of Tower 2, this state-of-the-art facility is named in memory of the mother of philanthropist and music icon Jose Mari Chan.In his remarks, Dr. Beaver Tamesis, Asian Hospital President and CEO, related that the idea of putting up a nursing simulation lab began “with the desire for our nurses to improve their skills set constantly” and allow them to practice in a simulated setting.The project “was kicked off the ground” with a very kind and generous donation from Chan. “We really hope that this facility will be very useful for our nurses and our partner schools who are here today. We will work closely with our partner schools so that they and our nurses will benefit from the experience that they will have here in the laboratory,” he added.Designed as a premier training ground for nurses, the lab will enable nurses to hone their skills and expand their knowledge in a simulated, real-world environment. Equipped with the latest technology and realistic medical scenarios, the lab provides hands-on experience, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.Dr. Buhain pointed out that the launch of the simulation lab is “a testament of our community’s collaborative spirit and our sheer dedication to nurturing the next generation of healthcare professional.”“No single word can encapsulate how we have been feeling since the day this program received its first yes from Dr. Beaver. From the concept to the construction and now to its commencement, we are indeed grateful to our CEO and to the mother of Jose Mari Chan who was the inspiration behind this lab. To Mr. Jose Mari Chan and to your family, thank you,” Dr. Buhain said.For his part, Muntinlupa City Mayor Rozzano Rufino “Ruffy” B. Biazon, Christmas came early in May as the simulation lab is not only a gift to Asian Hospital and to the nursing profession; it is a gift to the Philippines.“Just imagine the aftereffects of this facility. They skills that the nurses will earn will be passed on to millions of people locally and internationally. These people will benefit from the quality healthcare that they will receive and all this goes back to this facility,” he said.He added that this gift is for “everyone who will be touched, the lives that will be touched and the nurses who will be products of this facility.”“We do hope that we will see the products of this training facility and eventually when Muntinlupa opens its own nursing school, we will become a partner in this so that we can touch more lives. Thank you to the Chan family and you will be blessed,” he said.For his closing remarks, Chan related that his association with Asian Hospital “goes back some years ago because of my friendship with Dr. Jorge M. Garcia,” the hospital’s founder. He thanked the hospital for naming the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit after his father and now the simulation lab which is named after his mother “who died in this same hospital two years ago.”“Thank you so much for your friendship and I assure you that I told my children and my grandchildren that any time in the future, we are there for Asian Hospital,” Chan said.Follow AHMC social media accounts @AsianHospitalPH for services and exciting updates."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/05/30/hiv-aids-free-phl-is-achievable-by-2030-doh/,HIV/AIDS-free PHL is achievable by 2030–DOH,"AMID the challenges confronting the Philippines in so far as its fight against HIV and AIDS is concerned, the Department of Health (DOH) and its partners remain positive of achieving the national goal of ending this fatal illness in the next six years.“Our country is fraught with challenges. However, we are optimistic in addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic,” DOH Secretary Dr. Teodoro J. Herbosa said during the 2024 QUILTS Awards held at the San Jose Del Monte Convention Center in Bulacan last May 19, 2024.The global target for ending AIDS is set to be achieved by 2030. The Philippines, being among the nations with high HIV/AIDS cases on record, is actively committed to achieving this.According to the health chief, the country has seen the fastest growth in Asia and the Pacific with a 418-percent increase in new HIV infections since 2010. Also, it has the highest growth percentage of AIDS-related deaths in the region at 536 percent during the same period. In reference to the UNAIDS’s 95-95-95 targets, he cited that the Philippines’ performance is the following: Only 61 percent of HIV positive people know their status; only 64 percent of those who are aware on their status are on antiretroviral therapy (ART); and only 45 percent of those on ART have achieved viral suppression.Herbosa noted that more and more younger people, especially males, are diagnosed with HIV. In fact, about 47 percent of the new HIV infections are in the age range of 15 to 24 years old.Such national statistics are reflected also in the regional and local scenes. For instance, the top three regions with the highest cases of HIV are the National Capital Region (NCR), Region 4, and Region 3, respectively, based on DOH data from October to December 2023. Local government unit-wise, the City of San Jose Del Monte in Bulacan is also experiencing an uptrend. During a media briefing prior to the awarding ceremonies, City Health Officer Dr. Roselle Tolentino revealed that they have recorded 863 HIV cases since 1984. From January to December 2023 alone, there were 99 additional cases citywide. As of late, she added that HIV patients on treatment count at 498; the mode of transmission is highest among men having sex with other men; and in terms of age group, the highest infection is from 25 to 34 years, followed by 15 to 24 years old.ADDRESSING the country’s perennial HIV/AIDS problem is among the biggest government responsibilities that each of the administrations in succession has been working on for over four decades.President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. prioritizes both HIV and tuberculosis programs under his administration. During his 2003 State of the Nation Address, he directed the DOH to focus its efforts in combating HIV and AIDS in the country, urging the departments, national government agencies, academe, stakeholders, partners and communities to collate resources and streamline strategies and action towards their collective fight against such deadly diseases.In response to the chief executive’s order, Herbosa said that the DOH has released the health sector’s Medium-Term Strategy—the Eight Point Action Agenda, aptly called “Sa Bagong Pilipinas, Bawat Buhay Ay Mahalaga.”“This is designed to place Filipinos at the very heart of healthcare force grounded in humanistic leadership and good governance, and by replacing the delivery of health services through primary care with focus on several public health programs, including HIV and AIDS,” he explained.The health secretary commended the country’s allies to help combat the disease. He noted that through the aid of the President of the United States’ Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the US government has been their strong partner in achieving the “95-95-95” goals of the country by 2030, particularly on the third 95, which means that 95 percent of people living with HIV will achieve viral suppression. Their donations of more than 86,000 viral load cartridges allow people living with HIV to know their undetectable status.“Challenges across levels remain as we braved the road of ending AIDS by 2030. But we are hopeful that complementary work with the United States government, other development organizations who are with us tonight, our vibrant local community organizations, our tireless colleagues in the local government units, we will be able to overcome all of this,” Herbosa said. HONORING the great achievements in testing and treating HIV encourages service providers to excel more while motivating People Living with HIV (PLHIV) to continue on with their battle. The Meeting Targets and Maintaining Epidemic Control (EpiC) Philippines has been giving hope and inspiration as it celebrates, through the annual Quality Uptake and Improvements in Lifesaving Treatment Services (QUILTS) Awards, the accomplishments of its partner-facilities and community organizations within Greater Metro Manila, including NCR, Central Luzon, and CALABARZON (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon Province) that are making a difference in the lives of PLHIV and those affected by it, so they can continue to live meaningful, productive lives.“For three years that we’ve been doing the QUILTS Awards in those areas, we’ve seen that treatment interruption has reduced from 41 percent to 13 percent. That’s a big success because it means that if our compatriots with HIV are fully treated, they can no longer pass on the virus to others,” EpiC Philippines Project Director Teresita Bagasao said. “We believe that we can reach our goal of Zero AIDS [by 2030]. So we need to inspire more with this QUILTS Awards,” AIDS Society of the Philippines (ASP) President Irene Fonacier-Fellizar added, while sharing their plan to make this recognition initiative on a national scale.This year’s winners per category are: HIV Treatment Initiation (under 350 clients) accolade went to Cainta Reproductive Health & Wellness Center and SAIL Calamba; HIV Treatment Initiation (350 to 999 clients), Las Piñas Social Hygiene Clinic; HIV Treatment Initiation (Above 1000 clients), SAIL Makati; HIV Treatment Retention (under 350 clients), SAIL Caloocan; HIV Treatment Retention (350 to 999 clients), Bataan General Hospital (Bataan HAVEN); HIV Treatment Retention (Above 1000 clients), Love Yourself Victoria; HIV Viral Load Coverage (under 350 clients), Caloocan Social Hygiene Clinic; HIV Viral Load Coverage (350 to 999 clients), SAIL Cavite; HIV Viral Load Coverage (Above 1000 clients), Jose B. Lingad Regional Memorial Hospital (Bahay Lingad); Champion for Differentiated HIV Treatment Services (under 350 clients), Meycauayan City Primary HIV Care Clinic (Home of Bamboo); Champion for Differentiated HIV Treatment Services (350 to 999 clients), SAIL Cavite; and Champion for Differentiated HIV Treatment Services (Above 1000 clients), SAIL Makati.Special awards were given to deserving organizations. Laguna Medical Center bagged the Excellence Award for QuickRes.org, an online appointment booking system that makes HIV testing and treatment more accessible. Love Yourself Anglo took home the Excellence Award for HIV Services in Young Key Populations, and the City of San Jose del Monte, Bulacan was recognized as the QUILTS 2024 Host of the Year.“It is important that we highlight tonight that accomplishments are not just mere numbers but are lives that we continue to support, ensuring that they continue living healthy and productive lives. Beyond the plaques, the lives that we save from preventable AIDS-related illnesses are the true QUILTS Awards,” Herbosa stressed.The QUILTS Awards is an annual event started by the EpiC project as part of the USAID and PEPFAR. It is spearheaded by FHI360 and is in collaboration with the ASP and UNAIDS Philippines. This year’s edition also witnessed a Candle Lighting Ceremony for the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial (IACM) in honor and remembrance of those who passed away due to HIV and AIDS.“USAID and our partners [from the US Government] join you in remembering those who have lost their lives to HIV and AIDS. We will not forget those who fought long and hard to be acknowledged as worthy of the dignity and health services that all people deserve,” USAID Deputy Mission Director Rebekah Eubanks said."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/05/30/international-agencies-donate-mobile-health-facilities-to-help-curb-teen-pregnancies/,International agencies donate mobile health facilities to help curb teen pregnancies,"To promote and raise adolescent health to a higher level and address rising adolescent pregnancies in Eastern Visayas, the United Nations, and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) turned over two adolescent-friendly mobile health facilities that will offer free medical services to Samar and Southern Leyte provincial governments.The Joint Programme on Accelerating the Reduction of Adolescent Pregnancy (JPARAP) recently turned over the TrucKABATAAN to the local governments of Western Samar and Southern Leyte.The event was attended by KOICA Country Director KIM Eunsub, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Philippines Country Representative Dr. Leila Joudane, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Representative to the Philippines Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov, Western Samar Governor Sharee Ann Tan, Southern Leyte Governor Damian Mercado, Southern Leyte Vice Governor Rosa Emilia Mercado, local youth and the local medical teams.THE mobile health facilities, dubbed TrucKABATAAN, are part of the Joint Programme on Accelerating the Reduction of Adolescent Pregnancy in Southern Leyte and Samar in the Philippines, a collaborative effort supported by KOICA, in partnership with the Philippine government, UNFPA, UNICEF and WHO. The programme is estimated to potentially benefit 275,000 adolescents.“Reducing teenage pregnancies is a key goal for the Philippine government, a goal that the United Nations and our partners are committed to help achieve by mobilizing knowledge, resources, and opportunities to better enable youth in the Philippines to reach their full potential. These mobile health facilities provide accessible health services that are keys to empowering young people,” said Gustavo Gonzalez, United Nations Philippines Resident Coordinator in a press statement.The program was launched to tackle the pressing issue of adolescent pregnancy in the Philippines, which has been declared a national priority. While the Philippine Statistics Authority reported a slight decline in teenage fertility rates nationally (from 8.6 percent in 2017 to 5.4 percent in 2022), the number of adolescent mothers aged 10 to 19 continues to rise, particularly those in the worrying younger age bracket of 10 to 14.“I would like to remind everyone that KOICA stands with you in safeguarding and improving adolescent health and well-being. This year, we are celebrating the 75 years of Philippines-Korea diplomatic relations and the 30th anniversary of KOICA in the Philippines. These historical occasions give us the momentum to intensify our assistance to the country. We assure you that KOICA will continue to strongly support you for a realized comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights of Filipino adolescents and reduced adolescent pregnancies,” said Eunsub.BESIDES being one of the Philippines’ poorest and most typhoon-battered regions, the 2021 Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality Study showed that Eastern Visayas, where Samar and Southern Leyte are located, has one of the highest rates of 15 to 19-year-old females who got pregnant. “Over the past years, we have implemented various programs, projects, and strategies aimed at reducing adolescent pregnancy in the region. With the Universal Health Care Act, all stakeholders have been diligently working and putting in every effort and system in place to fully implement and realize Universal Health Care in the region. While there is still much to be done, we are making significant progress. Today, we are one step closer towards our goal of ensuring that every Filipino has equitable access to quality and affordable healthcare services. Through this mobile clinic, we will be bringing essential health services directly to the doorsteps of our young people. From sexual and reproductive health education to maternal and child health services, TrucKABATAAN will provide comprehensive support tailored to the unique needs of adolescents,” said Eastern Visayas Center for Health Development Regional Director Exuperia B. Sabalberino.The partners are working closely with the Department of Health, the Department of Education, and the governors of Samar and Southern Leyte, as well as other government agencies in rolling out adolescent-friendly services through the TrucKABATAAN, building the capacity of community adolescent health service providers, accelerating the integration of comprehensive sexuality education in schools, implementing youth leadership and governance initiatives, and conducting research on adolescent pregnancy and child, early, and forced marriage.“Pregnancy can be a beautiful journey, but for adolescents, it should not be part of their journey. Adolescence is a crucial time for personal growth, education, and development, and pregnancy can significantly disrupt these processes. The health-related risks are real. Adolescent mothers face higher risks of medical complications during pregnancy and childbirth compared to adult women. We must ensure access to quality healthcare and education to protect their health, prevent complications, and empower them to reach their full potential,” said Dr. Joudane.JOUDANE pointed out that adolescent pregnancy can result in anemia, sexually transmitted infections, unsafe abortions, postpartum hemorrhage, and mental health disorders. It can also exacerbate maternal undernutrition, resulting in low-birth-weight infants and childhood stunting. This perpetuates a cycle of malnutrition across generations.“All adolescents have the right to good health and well-being. Investing in adolescents’ health builds strong economies, inclusive communities and vibrant societies. Adolescent-centered approaches such as these mobile clinics put young people at the heart of the solution and give them opportunities to access key services and participate meaningfully in their communities,” said Dendevnorov.“We must strengthen and sustain our collaboration to effectively prevent adolescent pregnancy. Adolescent pregnancy is a public health concern that requires whole-of-society efforts that involve families, service providers, schools, faith- and community-based organizations, policymakers, and youth. We hope these mobile facilities will be able to bring services much closer to those in need at anytime, anywhere,” said Dr Rui Paulo de Jesus, WHO Representative to the Philippines.Rizal Raoul S. Reyes has covered technology, science, business, property and special reports. He had working stints with the Business Star, Manila Bulletin and Independent Daily News."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/05/30/pinoy-gen-zs-becoming-more-of-loner-worker-philcare-study/,Pinoy Gen Zs becoming more of loner worker–PhilCare study,"Filipino Gen Zs may have been born and lived in a digitally connected world, but research shows they are growing up to be workers who prefer to work independently. This is a key finding in a study by HMO leader PhilCare, which revealed that as much as 55 percent of Gen Zs prefer to work independently from a team. The survey, which is part of the groundbreaking “PhilCare Wellness Index: An Updated ABC of Pinoy Gen X, Y, and Z,” also said this sentiment of Filipino Zoomers are also being shared by their older peers, meaning Filipino Gen X and Millennials, as 50 percent of them said they also want to work alone.“While working in a team environment is not an issue for Gen Zs, the desire to work independently is perhaps their way to showcase their skills and abilities to their employers, as well as how much they value freedom and self-direction in their careers,” PhilCare President and CEO Jaeger Tanco said. Apart from the preference for working independently, less than half of Filipino Gen Zs are also interested in working in the Philippines, or about 48 percent, as opposed to the 54 percent of their older counterparts who wish to remain employed there. “There may be slightly fewer Gen X and Y workers than Gen Z workers who want to look for jobs abroad, but their reason for seeking international employment is most likely the same—to experience a new culture and personal growth. After all, an international experience can boost one’s competitiveness and marketability in the global job market.” Tanco added that in response to the insights they’ve gathered, PhilCare commits to providing comprehensive healthcare solutions that cater to the diverse needs of Filipino workers across generations. Innovative and groundbreaking offerings like prepaid healthcare plans and comprehensive personal healthcare plans allow PhilCare to support individuals in achieving their professional aspirations while prioritizing their health and well-being. “Our mission is to empower Filipino workers to lead healthy and fulfilling lives. Regardless of their generation, or whether they prefer to work independently in an office environment or as freelancers, or they want to collaborate with a team,” he said. “We can ensure that they, and even their families should they decide to work overseas, can access quality healthcare no matter where their career path may take them.”The “PhilCare Wellness Index: An Updated ABC of Pinoy Gen X, Y, and Z” is the seventh in the HMO giant’s groundbreaking series of nationwide health and wellness studies that started in 2014.This latest installment builds on the insights of two generational studies, the “PhilCare Wellness Index: The ABCs of Pinoy Xs and Ys” and the “PhilCare Wellness Index: The Rise of Filipino Gen Z,” and is a comparative analysis of the three generations. It aims to uncover the similarities and differences between them, as well as the evolving dynamics within the workforce and society at large."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/05/30/phl-upholds-global-commitments-on-population-development-goals/,"PHL upholds global commitments on population, development goals","The Philippines remains fully committed to population and development goals that were established some 30 years ago with global stakeholders, as it announced a marked improvement on policy creation and implementation. Last May 1, 2024, Undersecretary Lisa Grace S. Bersales, Ph.D delivered the country statement at the 30th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development and its resultant Programme of Action (ICPD-POA) during the 57th Session of the United Nations Commission on Population and Development in New York City. With her was the Philippines’ permanent representative to the United Nations Ambassador Antonio M. Lagdameo. There, the Commission on Population and Development (CPD) executive director articulated the Philippines’ full and continuous implementation of the ICPD-POA “as a significant policy and program framework in fulfilling the visions and aspirations of more than 112 million Filipinos to have strongly rooted, comfortable and secure lives.” Bersales also imparted the improved policy environment for the promotion of population and development, foremost of which is the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012, which was able to “expand access to universal and equitable comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services and information, which includes family planning services.” She likewise noted that the Magna Carta of Women, considered a comprehensive human-rights law, was able to “strongly protect, fulfill and promote the rights of Filipino women, with particular focus on the marginalized.” The CPD official explained that since the enactment of the above-mentioned policies, “the law that bans the practice of child marriage under Republic Act 11596, and one that increases the age of sexual content from as young as 12-years old and now 16-years old as covered by RA 11648, significantly contributed to the Philippines’ Top-20 ranking in the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index.” While she acknowledged that hurdles remain constant in adhering to the ICPD-POA, the POPDEV undersecretary pointed out that the challenges will be squarely addressed by the full rollout of the Philippine Population and Development Plan of Action (PPD-POA), which was recently approved by President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. “This plan includes addressing population issues under the three pillars of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals that are economic, social and environmental in nature,” the CPD chief pointed out. “It also explicitly lays out the vital role of our local government units, civil society organizations and the private sector, as main implementers.” As a founding member of the ICPD, Bersales renewed the country’s commitment to the realization of the plan of action’s global agreements from three decades ago: “The Philippines will continue to be an active participant, as well as a party to global cooperation and dialogue, in advancing human rights and development.” Bersales also shared her expertise in the field of statistics during the ICPD 57’s side-event on “Asia and the Pacific at the Crossroads: Building Inclusive and Sustainable Societies in Times of Significant Demographic Change,” where she highlighted the importance of data in policymaking and development-planning. According to her, “having data, especially disaggregated data, allows for targeted programming which, in turn, ensures those most in need are reached, such as women, girls, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, as well as populations in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas [or GIDAs].” The POPDEV undersecretary also emphasized maximizing partnerships as vehicles for the optimal usage of scarce resources."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/05/29/philhealth-increases-benefits-for-neonatal-sepsis-and-bronchial-asthma/,PhilHealth increases benefits for  neonatal sepsis and bronchial asthma,"ffective May 1, 2024, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) is implementing another round of enhancements in two of its existing benefit packages, this time for neonatal sepsis and bronchial asthma which have been increased heftily by more than 100%. PhilHealth Circulars 2024-0008 and 0009, the implementing guidelines of these two case rate packages, prescribe that all patients admitted on May 1, 2024 onwards may avail themselves of the increased benefits in accredited health facilities. According to PhilHealth President and CEO Emmanuel R. Ledesma, Jr., package rate for neonatal sepsis to P25,793 from P11,700 and bronchial Neonatal sepsis and other infectious conditions are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths in the Philippines. In 2023, PhilHealth paid P733.86 million for more than 57,000 cases for the said condition. On the other hand, asthma remains to be a high-burden ailment in the Philippines despite medical advancements. The majority of Filipinos with asthma do not have adequate control over their conditions, resulting in confinements. Based on PhilHealth data for 2023, asthma ranks eighth among the top medical confinements paid by the state insurer, where P717 M have been paid for, for more than 90,000 cases of asthma. PhilHealth identified neonatal sepsis and bronchial asthma as priority conditions in rationalizing its All Case Rates packages to improve financial coverage and lower further, if not eradicate the patients’ out-of-pocket expenses. Ledesma explained that PhilHealth also reminded the members that the adjusted case rates may be availed of in Levels 1 to 3 accredited public and private health facilities nationwide. Meanwhile, the previous rates of P11,700 for neonatal sepsis and P9,000 for bronchial asthma will be applied to patients admitted in accredited primary care facilities. The state agency also emphasized the important role that primary care plays in disease prevention and early detection. It has again called on primary care facilities to be Konsulta Package Providers (KPP) to provide wider access to drugs and medicines for the control of asthma. “Since our accredited KPP provides consultations, drugs and medicines and laboratory tests, hospital admission due to worsening of asthma will be avoided”, Ledesma added. The PhilHealth Chief also urged all members to register with their preferred Konsulta Package Provider to avail themselves of free consultations, health screening, and assessment, as well as any of the 21 essential drugs and medicines and 13 laboratory tests as will be required by their primary care physician."

(NACFI), the philanthropic arm of listed natural resource development company Nickel Asia Corp. (NAC) and the St. Luke’s Medical Center Foundation, Inc. (SLMCFI) held an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialty medical mission at Borongan, Province of Eastern Samar from May 13-17, 2024. The mission fulfills the Memorandum of Understanding between the NACFI, SLMCFI, and the Provincial Government of Eastern Samar for the province-wide surgical-medical mission. A total of 18 major surgeries and 8 minor surgeries were carried out by the St. Luke’s team and 473 patients received medical consultations for ENT cases. Additionally, a total of 158 nurses and ancillary medical staff attended specialized lectures through the St. Luke’s Healthcare Academy. “For me, the more special portion of this aside from doing the surgery was actually doing the lectures, because if you just go to one place do the surgeries, the consultations and leave, it feels like it’s just a one-time thing that you’re able to do, but if you help the ones that are left behind, make them equipped medically with knowledge of the specialty, then they will be able to carry on the treatment necessary for the specialty,” said Head of St. Luke’s Medical Center’s ENT Department Dr. Allan Carpela. “When the Office of the Governor asked the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, we received a notification last week to ask an authority to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NAC and the St. Luke’s Team, agad-agad binigay namin, dahil sobrang galak kami na andito kayo na tutulong sa amin para sa mabuting kalusugan ng mga tao sa Eastern Samar,” said Eastern Samar Vice Governor Maria Caridad S. Goteesan. The goal of the partnership between NACFI and SLMCFI is to bring St. Luke’s Medical Center’s culture of care and expertise to those underserved by the public healthcare system. “Isa sa mga mahahalagang nakita namin ay ang pakikipagugnayan sa kalusugan na napakaimportante sa aming mga stakeholders, ang kalusugan sa mga pamayanan kung nasaan may operations ang Nickel Asia at ang mga programang ito ay nagpatunay na isa ito sa ugnayan ng industriya at pamayanan,” said NAC AVP for Community Relations Reynaldo Dela Rosa. This mission is one of NAC’s ways of contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 which is the promotion of good health and well-being for all. “Mula rito, umaasa po kami ng patuloy na pakikipagtulungan upang makapaghatid ng serbisyong medical kasama ang aming partner, ang St. Luke’s Medical Center Foundation, Inc.,” said NAC AVP for Health Dr. Bimbo S.

This involves container management and the cleaning and covering of all containers where mosquitoes can breed.The General Services Office is working hard on its Denguerra drive. “The more garbage, the more possible breeding sites,” Panes said. She also stressed the need to watch all possible breeding sites such as drums, discarded vehicle tires, flower pots, and leaves of plants that catch water.Part of Denguerra, aside from a dedicated team that cleans up every Thursday, is encouraging residents to join in the activity within their premises.Denguerra was launched in 2022, but despite city efforts, spikes in dengue cases remain persistent, exacerbated by climate change.Dengue symptoms include two days of fever followed by rashes. But the most dangerous phase is after the fever goes down. “The most dangerous stage of dengue is when the fever goes down and you think you’re cured,” Panes said. “Most deaths occur due to late consultation and dehydration followed by organ failure,” she added.Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/05/27/pino-beauty-lounge-specializes-in-semi-permanent-makeup-tattoos-and-premium-aesthetic-services/,Pino Beauty Lounge specializes in semi-permanent makeup tattoos and premium aesthetic services. ,"Semi-permanent tattoos such as microblading and lip tattoo using the safest modern techniques and premium pigments, are what Pino Beauty Lounge is specializing in when it recently opened its doors along Tomas Morato in Quezon City. Chris Andrea Pino, chief marketing officer and co-owner of Pino Beauty Lounge, has been a beauty enthusiast for as long as she can remember. However, it was only recently when she decided to put up her own business and worked hands on in running it.Whenever Pino Beauty Lounge will introduce new machines or modern techniques, the beauty lounge uses the owners as guinea pigs to try the procedures.Foremost is Chris’ mom, Whena Pino, who was the first to put up a clinic specializing in semi-permanent make-up techniques at EDSA Shangri-La Plaza. The mom is now an industrial partner at Pino Beauty Lounge in Quezon City.“I have so much to learn from my mom as she started in this industry way earlier, and I know that her expertise is much needed as this is my first venture as an owner,” Chris admitted. “My friend (Regine Florida) and I were the ones who invested our capital to this new clinic and we have equal share.”Chris is also a certified semi-permanent makeup artist. She trained under PhiAcademy London eight years ago, when she was only 19 and still in college.“My mom wanted me to be the ‘youngest, certified microblading artist’ in the Philippines,” Chris said. “At that time, I was still focused on my studies.”Chris took up Political Science at the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) since she initially wanted to pursue a career in diplomacy. However, she realized early on she didn’t have as much passion for Political Science as she did trying on makeup or doing research on skincare products.“Even then, I knew I was a beauty girl through and through,” Chris maintained. “I decided to stick with my course until graduation, but during college I was active as a beauty blogger and content creator for major skincare and makeup brands.“It was also during college that my mom enrolled me in microblading training under PhiAcademy London. I didn’t know at that time how fortunate I was to be one of the first to study modern microblading from an international academy like PhiAcademy.”When Chris’ mom shifted to a career in semipermanent makeup after founding PhiBrows Manila, she brought Chris along with her and gave the latter an all-access pass to a wealth of knowledge that at that time (around 2015-2016), was very new in the Philippines.“When my mom opened her studio at EDSA Shangri-La Plaza, I was there to support her and I also assisted whenever I can. Later, I decided I could invest in myself and my dreams by opening another studio, this time, with me as a co-owner and as an artist who has her own skill set and expertise in the aesthetics industry.“After almost six years of training, shadowing my mom and gathering knowledge from the most reputable experts, we finalized plans for Pino Beauty Lounge in late 2023.”The specialty of Pino Beauty Lounge is in the field of semi-permanent makeup tattoo. “For us, each client is unique because no face is 100 percent identical and so, we employ science (in terms of measuring the face and facial features) and aesthetics (in terms of determining the best colors and techniques to use) to give a one of a kind and customized semi-permanent makeup tattoo,” Chris shared.“So, this is a proof of concept for me,” Chris says of the newly opened lounge. “This is not just skincare and aesthetics, there is also scientific knowledge. We employ the use of the golden ratio in measuring the face of our clients. We are not just drawing eyebrows arbitrarily based on our personal preference.“It has to be based on the client’s facial features, based on the measurement of their eyes or nose. No two faces are the same. Even identical twins have different facial features. They will never be the same.”Pino Beauty Lounge always uses the modern techniques, always tries to innovate and learns from all over the world. They had several clients who are beauty queens, models, celebrities, influencers and even politicians.Chris can honestly say all her clients have left feeling satisfied after she performed procedures on them.“We’re the most up to date,” Chris beamed. “Even for lip tattoo, my personal expertise and my favorite procedure to do. We do continuous innovation.”“Because Pino Beauty Lounge takes pride in mixing artistry with scientific knowledge that we have, we really give our best to all our clients. They can really see that.“It’s important to know that when done right, makeup tattoo can be an excellent beauty enhancement and will be a worthy investment.”Pino Beauty Lounge formally opens its doors on May 27 along Tomas Morato, Quezon City."

The medical website , whose content is reviewed and vetted by doctors, says “green coffee boasts an abundant supply of chlorogenic acids—compounds with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that may provide many health benefits.“Roasted coffee products also contain small amounts of chlorogenic acid, but most of it is lost during the roasting process.“Chlorogenic acids may help reduce one’s risk for chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.”In the Philippines, Ultra Green Coffee (UGC) proprietor Duncan Yu says he stumbled upon green coffee by chance, when he read about it in the contents of a milk tea brand. After doing some research, he launched UGC in 2016. “It’s an alternative for people who love to drink coffee but who suffer from an acidic stomach,” he points out. “As for its health benefits, the feedback I got from those who have tried my green coffee products are, in the case of women, reduced symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (in which the ovaries produce an abnormal number of androgens, male sex hormones that are usually present in women in small amounts), and regular menstrual cycle; and, for both men and women, lowered blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and better control of their appetite.”Here’s what says: “In an eight-week study, 50 people with metabolic syndrome—a cluster of risk factors, including high blood pressure and blood sugar, that increase your risk for diabetes and heart disease—took 400 mg of decaffeinated green coffee bean extract twice daily.“Those who took the extract experienced significant improvements in fasting blood sugar, blood pressure, and waist circumference, compared with a control group.”But Yu is not saying UGC is a miracle health drink: “Proper diet, adequate exercise, and avoiding stress are still the way to live a healthy life. But one thing I found out is that green coffee can suppress one’s appetite. That’s why you lose weight.”UGC is available in the following variants:· Classic Blend, made of green coffee extract with mangosteen, moringa, currant berry, banaba, guyabano and ampalaya;· Collagen Plus, green coffee with açai berry, aloe vera, vitamin C, and glutathione (2,500 mg Korean marine collagen);· Jamocha, classic blend ingredients with theobroma cacao;· Daily Veggies, green coffee with kale, spinach, broccoli, bitter gourd, moringa, and carrots.All variants come in powdered form with stevia."

This return of investment is a secondary concern. Our primary concern is to give the best and state of the art care to our patients,” he said.HE added that for patients, surgeries are a big emotional burden because they worry about how fast they can recover from the procedure and will there be pain.“This robotic surgery system is the answer to these concerns because it offers the best results for our patients.

Without issuing receipts, which is a violation of existing trade and revenue regulations; and4. Without observing good distribution and storage practices, which is a violation of standards implemented by FDA.Likewise, the FDA reiterated that all licensed drug manufacturers and distributors are not authorized to sell to unlicensed retail outlets, including clinics of medical doctors.The FDA also advised the public not to avail of medicines from clinics of doctors unless the abovementioned requirements are met.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

This event, the 1,386th worldwide blood drive, was attended by 200 people, including Church of God members and guests from Las Piñas, Manila, and Parañaque. People from all walks of life, including college students, office workers, policemen, and middle and old people, participated in voluntary free blood donations to awaken the importance of life and the value of blood donation.The ‘ which started in Korea in 2005, is based on the Passover love of Jesus Christ. On the Passover, the day before his sacrifice on the cross, Jesus established the new covenant with bread and wine, which symbolized His flesh and blood, and promised eternal life and the blessing of forgiveness of sins. The Church of God, imitating this noble spirit of love and sacrifice, has been holding blood donation events around the world to save the lives of others for over 20 years.The event, which was held at the Church of God building in Las Piñas City was actively collaborated with the Las Piñas General Hospital and the Satellite Trauma Center.

We were able to help many people because of this endeavor. Congratulations, World Mission Society Church of God!”A Church of God official said, “The saints are united in saving their neighbors in danger by emulating the love of Christ, who sacrificed for the salvation of mankind,” and added, “I hope that those who suffer from accidents or diseases will get better as soon as possible and lead a healthy daily life.”“Blood donation is a gift and hope that saves lives,” said (25 years old), smiling brightly, cheering on the blood transfusion recipients, saying, “Animo blood donors!” As a way to uplift all the participants, the members of the Church of God and all the guests participated in listening to the beautiful music of the Church of God chamber orchestra and the bible seminar prepared by the church, adding to the significance of life sharing.The Church of God, which also held a blood donation event in Cebu on the 6th of May, held voluntary free blood donations in Quezon City, Mandaluyong, and Urdaneta this year alone. The number of participants reached 615. The Church of God, which has been conducting group blood donations in the Philippines since 2012, has held more than 60 blood donation events. Through this, it not only promoted citizen awareness about voluntary free blood donation, but also contributed to resolving blood supply shortages in the community.In addition, they have contributed to the country and society through various volunteer services such as environmental cleanup, tree planting, and comfort at welfare facilities.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/05/23/experts-urge-preventive-measures-vs-spike-in-illnesses-among-children/,Experts urge preventive measures vs. spike in illnesses among children,"Pediatricians observed in the last quarter of 2023 a recurring wave of illnesses among children, attributing it to their exposure to new viruses, contact with infected peers and a lack of essential vitamins.According to General Pediatrician Mary Joan Millonado during the 50th anniversary celebration of Ceelin at the Unilab Bayanihan Center on Friday, May 17, 2024 children are particularly susceptible to respiratory infections such as rhinovirus, the common cold, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other viral groups due to their still-developing immune systems.She emphasized that a children’s immune system is not fully mature until they reach the age of three to four years old.“They’re really prone to developing, especially respiratory and bioinfections,” Millonado said.However, the American Academy of Pediatrics states that it is normal for children of this age to experience 10 to 12 respiratory infections in a single year. Yet, Millonado emphasized that there are measures parents can take to protect their children.She noted that the pandemic has taught everyone the importance of proper handwashing and avoiding touching their faces, which remain effective preventative measures.Additionally, maintaining proper sleep hygiene, ensuring children get adequate sleep, and keeping them active through regular exercise are crucial. However, many parents admit challenges in providing outdoor time due to limited access to open spaces, particularly those residing in condominiums.Nonetheless, health experts said that there are various ways to promote activity at home, including non-physical games and indoor games.“It’s also the time of the year for our children to get updated with the yearly flu shots,” Millonado said.Meanwhile, in April 2024, the Department of Health (DOH), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), participated in the World Immunization Week under the Essential Programme on Immunization (EPI). This global initiative aims to provide equitable access to life-saving vaccines for all children, irrespective of their geographic location or socioeconomic status.The local campaign, titled “50 Years of Immunization: Kapag Bakuna ay Kumpleto, Lahat Protektado!” highlights the country’s efforts to safeguard children, adolescents, pregnant women, and the elderly from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs).In a statement, WHO Representative to the Philippines, Dr. Rui Paulo de Jesus, emphasized that immunization is a fundamental component of primary health care and that every child has the right to be protected from vaccine-preventable diseases.Despite the significant impact of vaccinations over the past five decades, the 2022 WHO and UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage (WUENIC) reported that 637,000 children in the Philippines remain unvaccinated, putting them at higher risk of disease.Meanwhile, Millonado highlighted the importance of a nutritious diet, supplemented with vitamins C and zinc, to boost children’s immune systems.When asked about the importance of administering vitamins even when a child is sick, nutritionist and dietitian Maria Joanna Cruz-Balili explained that illness, stress, and deficiencies can cause a rapid decline in vitamin C and zinc levels.She emphasized that when these nutrients are deficient, the immune system becomes even more compromised, further lowering its defenses. Therefore, parents must consistently provide their children with both vitamin C and zinc supplements to maintain their immune system’s strength."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/05/23/advocates-appeal-for-urgent-enactment-of-teen-pregnancy-prevention-bill/,Advocates appeal for urgent enactment of Teen Pregnancy Prevention Bill,"IN their collective fight against the growing adolescent pregnancy problem nationwide, Save the Children Philippines, together with government agencies, civil society organizations (CSOs), and adolescent advocates, called for the immediate enactment of the Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Bill, which aims to empower adolescents to prioritize education and health over parenthood.During a press briefing last May 13, 2024 they underscored the critical need for inclusive sexual health dialogues within communities and government institutions. The proposed bill garnered support from key organizations, including the Department of Education (DepEd), Commission on the Welfare of Children, Commission on Population and Development, Family Planning Organization of the Philippines, Philippine Legislators Committee on Population and Development, Young Feminist Collective, Oxfam Pilipinas, and Global OFW Advance Movement.GOVERNMENT reports show a troubling trend: an increase in pregnancies among girls aged 10 to 14. From 2016 to 2020, registered births to mothers in this age group grew by 11 percent, translating to an average of five to seven births daily. Based on data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (2020), 59.5 percent of these births were fathered by adult men aged 20 and over, or nearly six out of every 10 adolescent births. Alarmingly, about one in every five registered adolescent births lack information about the father’s age. This issue is particularly pronounced among the 10 to 14 age group, where more than 40 percent of adolescent births lack father’s age information, compared to just 17 percent in the 15 to 19 age group.GIVEN these concerning statistics, different advocates have spoken out about the need for comprehensive education and open dialogue on sexual health. For Sydney, a passionate adolescent advocate, open conversations about sexual health within families and communities are not indecent but a fundamental right. She said that sexual health espouses broader rights beyond mere activity and ought to be discussed openly and respectfully.On the other hand, Julia Mari, representing the Young Feminists Collective, emphasized the significance of honoring motherhood by empowering young people to make informed decisions about parenthood. The bill, she noted, seeks to protect their future by equipping them with the knowledge and resources necessary for their well-being and success.Meanwhile, Pastor Jo Biasong, a family planning advocate and evangelist, pointed out the need to build safe and supportive spaces within religious congregations. He said that protecting a child is integral to fostering open dialogue and enabling children to advocate for their rights within church communities.On the government side, DepEd Assistant Secretary Dexter Galban shared the critical link between adolescent pregnancy and overall well-being. He cited the implementation of Comprehensive Sexuality Education in the DepEd, beginning with age-appropriate information and progressing as learners mature. This program aims to prioritize youth and contribute to national development.UNDERSECRETARY Angelo Tapales of the Council for the Welfare of Children stressed the need for new ways to address these challenges. He emphasized the importance of believing that children can make decisions best for them.Mylin Mirasol Quiray, acting division chief of the Commission on Population and Development, urged Malacañang to re-issue Executive Order 141, making adolescent pregnancy a national priority beyond family concerns. She noted the significant effect of adolescent pregnancy on girls’ lives and the national economy.The Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Bill (HB 8910) was overwhelmingly backed in the Lower House with 232 affirmative votes. But its Senate counterpart, Senate Bill 1979, faces uncertainty as it awaits consideration for the second reading.Advocates stress the urgency of passing the bill. Aurora Quilala, deputy executive director of the Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development, cited extensive consultations and alignment with ground realities, stressing the critical need for legislative action.With Congress soon adjourning and reconvening in July, crusaders are urgently pressing for the bill’s passage. They particularly urge the Senate to conduct the second reading promptly. Quick action is crucial before the legislative session pauses for recess until after the State of the Nation Address in July and shifts attention to re-election campaigns in October. Advocates emphasize the importance of advancing this legislation swiftly to address the pressing issue of adolescent pregnancy in the Philippines.Roderick L.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/05/21/if-youve-tried-meditating-but-cant-sit-still-heres-how-and-why-to-try-again/,"If you’ve tried meditating but can’t sit still, here’s how — and why — to try again","The first time Marcelle Hutchins sat down to meditate, she put on a guided session, relaxed her shoulders and tried to close her eyes. She lasted two minutes.“I had a deadline, and I thought, ‘I don’t know if I can sit still this long,’” said Hutchins, who was working as a radio journalist.At the urging of her father, a longtime practitioner, she tried again and managed to finish a 10-minute video on her third attempt. “I remember feeling this sense of joy and relaxation,” she said. “I used to be that person who said, ‘I can’t meditate.’”Hutchins has since become a certified meditation teacher — and serves as an example that busy, restless people who try once should try again. Research shows a daily meditation practice can , improve and , among other benefits.The trick is to get over that initial barrier. Experts say it’s more achievable when you throw common misconceptions out the window. For instance, many people try meditation only once because they feel they’re doing it wrong or that they can’t turn off their brain.That’s not the point, says Tara Brach, who holds a doctorate in psychology and has trained more than 7,000 people to be meditation teachers.“It’s not about stopping thoughts. The mind generates thoughts the way body creates enzymes,” she said. “It’s about being able to get larger than the thoughts and witness them.”There is no right way to meditate, Brach stressed.The key is to relax and focus on something in the present moment. Feel your breath pass through your nostrils, listen to a guided recording, mentally scan your body from head to toe, repeat a loving phrase to yourself or try countless other techniques.You can sit on the floor, in a chair or on a cushion. If you can’t get comfortable, lie down. You don’t even need to close your eyes, though it’s recommended to try.There is no standard amount of time to begin with, but set an achievable goal.“You can customize it to who you are,” said Brach, author of several books, including .“Start with the most you can comfortably do without having to feel like you want to quit,” she saidThat could mean starting with as little as a few minutes, said John Mitchell, an associate professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University who uses . The goal should be working meditation into a routine and focusing on the quality of the practice, not the quantity.“Then the question is, what do we do to create success so we can have momentum and start off without feeling like you’re failing right way?” he said.When you inevitably get distracted — everyone does — notice the thought or urge to move, acknowledge it and bring your attention back to where you are.Instead of judging yourself, get curious for a minute about the nature of restlessness, Brach said. Ask yourself, “What does it really feel like if I want to jump out of my skin?”Then take a long, deep breath, and sit for one more minute. If you still want to move, then move. But Brach recommended doing so mindfully. Stand up, do a light stretch, take a deep breath and sit again. You will be surprised at how that sense of restlessness will change over time, she said. “It will evolve.”If the restlessness builds to a point where you are uncomfortable, consider taking a slow, meditative walk, Mitchell said. Stay alert but calm, focusing on the sounds, sights and smells around you, or maybe on the sensation of the wind and sun on your face.“You’re not restricted,” he said. “You don’t have to sit there in silence and be still all the time.”After sticking through the first session, you will almost certainly feel calmer, no matter the length. But to get the full benefits, , research shows you need to practice consistently.For people having trouble starting, that can be daunting, but Brach suggested trying a few techniques to find the right fit.“It takes a bit of experimentation to find the style of meditation that works for your particular body, mind and personality,” she said.Luckily, there’s a universe of free meditation resources online.“Nobody reading this needs to go buy anything,” she said.Image credits:"

Christopher “Bong” Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, if he has any knowledge of the alleged MLM scheme, Herbosa admitted that he was just aware of the “perks” given by the pharmaceutical companies to the doctors.“[What I’ve heard of are] trips to foreign conferences, and probably meals in expensive restaurants,” Herbosa said, partly in Filipino.“It’s only now that I’ve learned of this multi-level marketing. And it’s only now that I’ve learned how exorbitant the gifts are,” the health chief added.Herbosa revealed that he became aware of the alleged scheme when it was mentioned in a previous Senate hearing and he received a message from someone through social media about it afterwards.Meanwhile, Sen. Raffy Tulfo, who brought with him a list of doctors involved in the alleged multilevel marketing scheme, grilled the official of Bell-Kenz Pharma present at the hearing.Tulfo asked Dr. Luis Raymond Go, chairperson and chief executive officer of Bell Kenz-Pharma Inc., whether they give commissions to doctors as incentives for prescribing their medicines to the patient.Go denied this and said their company follows the laws, regulation, and ethical standards as they offer “high- quality” but affordable medicines.“Mr. Chair, in recent days, our company has been found [ . . . ] and smeared in a web of misinformation through various media channels,” Go said as he refuted before the panel what he called “baseless accusations” and asserted their group’s “commitment, integrity and compliance.”However, Tulfo claimed he holds several bank checks proving that the pharmaceutical company is providing incentives to its member-doctors.Also present at the Senate panel on health and demography’s hearing were Senators Joseph Victor Ejercito and Jinggoy Estrada.Ejercito, meanwhile, expressed concern that the reported practices involving unscrupulous pharmaceutical companies and doctors would drive up healthcare costs in the country.Ejercito noted ethical, legal and policy concerns over the alleged collusion between some doctors and Bell-Kenz Pharma Inc., supposedly resulting in pricier and unnecessary prescriptions.“The scandal undoes our efforts to make healthcare more affordable,” said Ejercito, who stressed that laws such as the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act were passed to reduce the Filipinos’ health expenses. “What’s the purpose of this if one individual prescribes pricier medicine?” he asked aloud, in Filipino.The senator said the UHC Act has reduced out-of-pocket payments to 44 percent in 2022.On the other hand, Estrada asked the DOH to act immediately on the alleged unethical practice of some doctors colluding with a pharmaceutical firm in the prescription of medicines.“This hearing is an opportunity to recommit ourselves to the Hippocratic oath and the sacred relationship between healer and healed. Let it serve as a reminder of our responsibilities and values,” Estrada said.Get to bottom of the controversySenator Go vowed to get to the bottom of the controversy as he sought the protection not only of patients’ rights, but also of doctors over the alleged collusion with pharmaceutical firms.“We don’t wish to see the day when the people lose their trust in our doctors’ prescriptions, and their medical advice, just because of a few scoundrels. A grave danger is to have an unintended consequence of creating a public perception that all pharma companies and doctors are unclean,” Go said.Herbosa, meanwhile, said that doctors involved in the alleged scheme may face charges.Image credits: Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

Symptoms come on rapidly over two to three days. They can include difficulty closing an eyelid, a drooping eye or mouth or paralysis of an entire half of the face.Cases can be mild or severe.It can affect anyone but is most likely to occur between the ages of 15 and 45, according to the National Institutes of Health.No one knows. But people more at risk include those who have high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity or are pregnant.It’s been associated with infections such as the herpes simplex virus and Epstein-Barr virus, as well as Lyme disease and autoimmune disorders. The NIH says other possible triggers may include impaired immune reactions to minor illnesses or injury.There isn’t a single test to diagnose Bell’s palsy but doctors start by physically examining facial muscles. It’s important to seek care to rule out more serious conditions such as a stroke.Treatment depends on the person’s symptoms and severity. Doctors may prescribe steroidal medications to reduce the nerve inflammation or antivirals. If there’s any involvement of the eyelid, patients receive care to protect the eye from dryness, such as an eyepatch or eye drops or ointments.Fortunately, Bell’s palsy is temporary for the vast majority of patients. The NIH says most recover some or all facial function within a few weeks to six months.Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/29/phap-papo-partner-for-ethical-interactions-in-the-healthcare-sector/,"PHAP, PAPO partner for ethical interactions in the healthcare sector ","Several organizations representing patient organizations, medical device and biopharmaceutical industry associations, healthcare professional and hospital groups have partnered to advance patient welfare through ethical interactions.The Philippine Consensus Framework for Ethical Collaboration is an initiative being pushed forward by country counterparts of reputable global healthcare organizations namely the International Alliance of Patient Organizations (IAPO), World Medical Association (WMA), International Council of Nurses (ICN), International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA), and International Pharmaceutical Federation (IPF). These international organizations developed the “Consensus Framework for Ethical Collaboration Between Patients’ Organizations, Healthcare Professionals, and the Pharmaceutical Industry” in support of high-quality patient care.In 2020, the Philippines became one of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations that has adopted its own Consensus Framework. The goal is to put patients at the center of all healthcare efforts through the advancement of ethical principles. “We welcome the Consensus Framework as a commitment to putting the patients’ interests as top priority when making medical decisions. All these crucial interactions must be in support of patients for us to be better informed and empowered to decide on the most appropriate treatment from the options available to us. The ethical and professional conduct of everyone in the healthcare community is critical to ensuring that patients’ rights are protected and that the patients have the ability to make decisions based on their needs and preferences,” said Philippine Alliance of Patient Organizations (PAPO) President Ms. Karen Alparce- Villanueva. PAPO is the umbrella organization of 50 disease-specific patient groups representing at least a million Filipino patients nationwide. Their aim is to strengthen the voice of the patients in the country so that the healthcare system is designed and delivered in a way that will answer the needs of patients. PAPO is also a member of the International Alliance of Patient Organizations(IAPO) which is a unique global alliance of national, regional and international groups representing patients as well as holds a Non-State Actor status with the World Health Organization (WHO). “We are honored to be one of the signatories of the Philippine Consensus for Ethical Collaboration as this initiative is aligned with our mandate to promote ethics and professional conduct in the pharmaceutical industry and the healthcare ecosystem. The Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines and our Members are united in our resolve to act ethically and professionally so that all medical decisions will be made in the best interest of patients,” said PHAP President Dr. Diana Edralin. A member of the IFPMA, PHAP represents the biopharmaceutical medicines and vaccines industry in the country. Its Members are in the forefront of research and development efforts for COVID-19 and other diseases that affect Filipinos.The Consensus Framework is a principles-based commitment to support ethical conduct across the organizations from government, to private sector, not-for-profit groups, healthcare professionals and providers, and patient associations. It builds on the APEC Mexico City Principles for Voluntary Codes of Business Ethics in the Biopharmaceutical Sector which was adopted in 2011 during the U.S. APEC host year and recognized by APEC Leaders and Ministers. The Philippine Consensus Framework espouses the following principles: Put Patients First; Support Basic and Ethical Research and Innovation; Ensure Independence and Ethical Conduct; Promote Transparency and Accountability; Establish Trust and Solidarity; Prioritize Quality Care and Innovation; and Foster Respect for All. Meanwhile, the Consensus Framework does not replace the individual ethical codes of its 20 organizational signatories representing patients, healthcare providers, nurses, pharmacists, medical technologists, hospitals, non-profit international organizations, medical device and biopharmaceutical industry. The PHAP Code of Practice, for example, remains in full force among its members. “As a sector that strongly believes in the conduct of professional business practices, PHAP has undertaken pioneering initiatives in helping ensure that we remain committed to promoting people’s health with integrity. We established the PHAP Code of Practice in 1993 to govern our actions, and we are proud of our members because they have deeply embedded integrity in their culture, decisions and interactions,” said PHAP Executive Director Mr. Teodoro Padilla. Adherence to the PHAP Code of Practice is a requirement for its membership. It is aligned with the Mexico City Principles, the Code of Practice of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), and the Department of Health (DOH) Administrative Order on DOH AO 2015-0053 Implementing Guidelines on the Promotion and Marketing of Prescription Products and Medical Devices.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/25/get-better-sleep-with-these-5-tips-from-experts/,Get better sleep with these 5 tips from experts,"Spending too many nights trying to fall asleep — or worrying there aren’t ? You’re not alone.Nearly say they don’t get the recommended seven to nine hours a night. Some of the major causes: Stress, anxiety and a culture that experts say is about productivity, not rest.“You need to understand what your body needs and try your hardest to prioritize that and not just see sleep as kind of what’s left over of the day,” said Molly Atwood, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.Don’t fall for online fads or unproven methods to fall asleep and stay asleep. Instead, try these simple tricks recommended by sleep experts.Work-related stress is inevitable, and it can be hard to disconnect. Try creating a “buffer zone” between the end of your work day and your bedtime.Experts suggest leaving career work and daily responsibilities alone about an hour before bed. Don’t check email, pay bills, do chores or scroll endlessly through social media. Instead, create a routine where you relax with a book, indulge in a hobby or spend time with loved ones.“It goes back to the core value of mindfulness,” said Dr. Annise Wilson, an assistant professor of neurology and medicine at Baylor University. “Anything that helps to center you and just helps you focus and release a lot of that tension from the day will then help promote sleep.”Eating a large meal right before bedtime can disrupt your sleep, so try to grub in the early evening hours.“I would say that eating a large meal is impactful simply because it’s like giving your body a really large job to do right before sleep at a time when things are supposed to be shutting down,” Atwood said.But don’t go to bed super-hungry, either. Try snacks with protein or healthy fats, like cheese, almonds or peanut butter on whole grain bread.Having a nightcap or post-dinner espresso might feel relaxing, but it could lead to a long night.While alcohol can help you fall asleep initially, it can disrupt your sleep cycle, reducing the quality of sleep and increasing the chances you’ll wake up more often in the middle of the night.Caffeine is a , a chemical that contributes to the feeling of sleepiness — and it can take your body up to 10 hours to clear caffeine.For these reasons, experts suggest finishing up your caffeinated or boozy beverages several hours before bed.Light from phones and computer screens can – or the internal clock that naturally wakes us up – by suppressing melatonin, which assists with sleep.But you’ll need self-discipline to stop streaming or scrolling, said Dr. Dianne Augelli, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.“TikTok doesn’t want you to stop,” Augelli said. “Only you can stop you, so you have to learn to put that stuff away.”If nothing’s working and you’ve struggled to get a good night’s sleep for more than a month, experts say it’s time to go to a doctor. This is especially true if your sleepless nights are interfering with your work performance or your mood.“It doesn’t matter how much relaxation you do. At a certain point, it’s not going to be effective if there’s a significant amount of stress,” Atwood said. “… It might involve some problem-solving to figure that out.”Image credits:"

Medica, Inc. and MedEthix Inc., were recently awarded the Supply Chain Initiative of the Year, Hospital Partnership of the Year, and the Most Differentiated Service of the Year awards.MedEthix was recognized for leveraging the synergy of strategic alliances to ease the access of Molnupiravir in the Philippines at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.I.E. Medica was also awarded for its efforts in implementing solutions to its end-to-end supply chain operations to meet the nation’s healthcare product supply chain needs.“This marks the first time native Philippine pharmaceutical brands have won in these categories. The brands are active proponents in the importation, registration, and supply of healthcare products in the Philippines,” the BrandComm Asia statement said.The two firms are sister companies.I.E. Medica and MedEthix executives, Monaliza Balnig Salian, co-founder, president and CEO, and Ma. Victoria P. Sugapong, COO, accepted the awards on behalf of the pharma group at the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore, which was held on late March.In her acceptance speech, Salian said the Philippine pharmaceutical industry “is heavily dependent on importation; thus, we continuously look for ways to improve our supply chain operations.”“As a young pharma group, I.E. Medica and MedEthix are aware of the overwhelming needs of our countrymen for quality, affordable, and accessible healthcare solutions, and so we will continue to respond to these unmet needs, as Filipinos, for the Filipino,” she addedThe awards are conferred by the respected regional publication Healthcare Asia magazine.I.E. Medica said it was on track to secure the Level 1 Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) Certification from the Philippine Customs Administration to comply with supply chain security standards and the benefits of improved accessibility to healthcare goods brought about by streamlined import-export systems across borders. It obtained the Super Green Lane certificate in 2017 for having demonstrated its initial compliance with the cargo security risk management framework required for accreditation as an AEO importer.The MedEthix, on the other hand, secured its first four hospital partners from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the compassionate special permit (CSP) for Molnupiravir, the oral drug indicated for mild to moderate cases of Covid-19 infection. It later expanded the distribution of Molnupiravir from the first four CSP grantees to more 80 health institutions and more than 500 doctors across the country.“As recipients of the three prestigious awards for the pharma category in the Philippines, I.E. Medica and MedEthix remain committed to providing a wide range of products that cover almost all therapeutic areas to meet the ever-changing healthcare needs of Filipinos,” Salian said.Manuel T.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/25/vaccination-is-still-the-most-effective-method-vs-pertussis/,Vaccination is still the most effective method vs pertussis,"The number of pertussis or whooping cough cases in the Philippines continue to grow at an alarming rate and sadly, so does the number of fatalities.The Department of Health (DOH) reported that for the first three months of the year, 1,112 cases have already been recorded, with around 54 deaths from January 1 to March 30, 2024.The health agency also revealed that out of the total number of cases, around 77 percent of them were children below five years old, with adults 20 years of age and above accounting for four percent of the cases.As the number of pertussis cases continue on an upward trend, the DOH also noticed a continuing increase of cases in five regions, mainly Eastern Visayas, Cagayan Valley, the administrative region of CARAGA or Region 13, Central Luzon, and the Cordillera Autonomous Region or CAR. And there are now pertussis outbreaks in Quezon City, Pasig City, Iloilo City, and Cavite.AS defined by the Philippine College of Physicians (PCP) “pertussis is an acute respiratory infection caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. The infection poses a significant threat particularly among infants and young children who are at risk of severe symptoms and life-threatening complications and outcome. While teens and adults may experience milder symptoms, there is a risk of severe illness, especially for those with pre-existing health conditions and the unvaccinated elderly population.”And the PCP is deeply concerned by this continuing rise in cases of pertussis across the nation. It said that pertussis “is a highly contagious respiratory disease that can have serious consequences, particularly for infants, young children, and individuals with compromised immune systems.”The rising cases of pertussis thus prompted the PCP to issue a position paper complete with recommendations and strategies to address the issue, highlighting the critical “importance of vaccination, early detection, and appropriate treatment in preventing the spread of pertussis and protecting vulnerable populations from its potentially severe complications.”The PCP also expressed its full and unequivocal support to the call of the DOH in conducting enhanced vaccination campaigns across the country, with the hope of increased vaccination coverage and to protect all infants and children to vaccine preventable diseases.“We urge all stakeholders, healthcare providers, local government units and community leaders to collaborate in preventing the spread of pertussis and other vaccine preventable infections including measles, diphtheria, influenza and pneumonia,” the PCP said.Regarding vaccination, the PCP highly recommends getting a single Tdap vaccine, a common vaccine that protects against three serious bacterial infections such as Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis for infants and children. It said the three-dose primary immunization series with DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis) recommended at ages 1 1⁄2, 2 1⁄2, and 3 1⁄2 months, plus booster of one dose at 12-18 months and another booster dose between 4 to 6 years old.For Adolescents, on the other hand, who have already completed the recommended childhood DTaP series, a single DTaP booster should be given, particularly recommended for adolescents aged between nine to 18 years old.As for Adults, the PCP said those aged 19 to 64 years old should receive a single Tdap booster in lieu of one Td booster shot. With regard to adults 65 years old and above who has yet to receive a Tdap booster should receive one booster dose, particularly if contact with infants is anticipated.The PCP paper also strongly suggested that the Tdap vaccine be administered to pregnant women of all ages, ideally in the third trimester or between 27 and 36 weeks of each pregnancy.For those who are particularly susceptible or have not been vaccinated previously, the Tdap vaccine may also be administered during the first trimester, the paper added.The paper also cited that several studies have consistently shown that the Tdap vaccines helps significantly decrease the incidence of pertussis by over 92 percent and decrease mortality rates by 97 percent. In fully vaccinated individuals the PCP said “symptoms tend to be less severe, with a reduced likelihood of experiencing prolonged coughing spells, apnea, and cyanosis. Extensive safety evaluations have confirmed that Tdap vaccines are safe for use in children and adults, pregnant women and seniors over the age of 65, with no unexpected safety concerns reported.The PCP likewise called on parents and caregivers to be vigilant for symptoms of pertussis such as cough, colds, fever, and to seek immediate medical attention. “Early diagnosis and treatment are key to improving patient outcomes and reducing transmission,” it said.In conclusion, the organization, a group composed of leading medical health professionals, also reiterated its strong support to the government, the DOH and the healthcare community in dealing with the pertussis outbreak.“We encourage everyone to participate in vaccination campaigns and adhere to public health guidelines. We are one in protecting our communities, our children and the vulnerable populations from the potentially devastating effects of these vaccine-preventable infections.”"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/25/doh-told-to-expedite-flu-immunization-campaign-for-seniors-to-prevent-outbreaks/,DOH told to expedite flu immunization campaign for seniors to prevent outbreaks,"Over the past year, the Philippines witnessed a staggering 45 percent surge in cases of influenza-like illnesses (ILI), indicating a notable uptick in respiratory diseases. This poses a significant threat, especially among senior citizens who are more susceptible to heart attacks and pneumonia once contracting the flu virus. Compounding this issue, is the 568 pertussis cases that have emerged in numerous communities across the country, further emphasizing the critical need for immediate vaccination efforts.Vaccine experts, meanwhile, called on the Department of Health [DOH] to expedite the flu immunization campaign to prevent an outbreak that could severely impact senior citizens and to mitigate potential outbreaks before the expected peak incidence between June and November.“The recent outbreak of respiratory diseases is a testament to the importance of early preparation in mitigating the impact of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). The DOH must act now and expedite the release of flu vaccines to the public before the peak incidence to safeguard the elderly from severe complications like pneumonia,” stressed Dr. Rontgene Solante, Infectious Disease Expert and lead convenor of the Raising Awareness on Influenza to Support Elderlies (RAISE) Coalition. Under the Expanded Senior Citizens act of 2010, the DOH is tasked to administer free vaccination against the influenza virus and pneumococcal disease for indigent senior citizens.Nevertheless, the RAISE Coalition and various legislators have been advocating to expand this further to cover all senior citizens in the country. Dr. Lulu Bravo, RAISE Coalition co-convenor, called on the DOH to expand free flu vaccination for all seniors. She stated, “Many elderly depend solely on government-provided free vaccines as their primary protection against the flu.”Additionally, she stressed, “It is crucial to vaccinate all seniors, similar to the proactive measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Controlling pertussis will take time, and its concurrent rise with flu cases could strain our healthcare system’s capacity to respond effectively.”Apart from the urgent need for flu vaccines, the two health experts also highlighted the importance of tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccination for the elderly population amid the outbreak, emphasizing its importance beyond just infants and children. Getting vaccinated not only helps reduce potential transmission but also acts as a protective measure for households and the wider community. As a multi-sectoral group that has been working with esteemed medical societies, the RAISE Coalition emphasizes the critical role of the government in prioritizing timely response and vaccination programs, particularly for the elderly population.Ensuring their access to preventive healthcare, including vaccination, is not just essential but also a fundamental right, crucial for safeguarding their overall well-being and reducing the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs).Furthermore, the coalition encouraged senior citizens to proactively inquire at their health centers for their free flu vaccinations.Meanwhile, UNICEF said the measles and pertussis outbreak in the Philippines is a wake-up call. The aid organization pointed out that the country is experiencing outbreaks in the Bangsamoro region and pertussis outbreaks in parts of Luzon and Visayas while nearly 70 percent of provinces and cities are at high risk for polio. All three are highly infectious diseases for children.The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao embarked on a Measles Outbreak Response Immunization at the beginning of the month after declaring the outbreak mid-March. The region had already reported more than 500 measles cases before the start of the campaign on April 1, 2024. This number is already half of the cases reported for almost 2023 and could be much higher, troubling for a region that has great aspirations for its children and future. “Immunization is one of the crucial components of a robust health system. On the 50th year of the Essential Programme of Immunization, we’ve gone from a world where the death of at least one child was something every parent expected to a world where every child has a chance if they get their vaccines. To stem the outbreak, we urge leaders to go to the hardest-hit communities to see with their own eyes the many challenges being faced by families and health workers,” UNICEF Philippines Representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov said. To support the measles and pertussis outbreaks, UNICEF is helping the emergency procurement of two million doses of measles vaccines, fielding immunization coordinators, cold chain managers and social mobilizers in the poorest performing provinces, engaging community leaders to address refusals, and providing cold rooms to keep the vaccines potent, among others. One million measles vaccines are projected to arrive in the coming weeks, with a million more expected in the coming months.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/25/death-talks-end-of-life-planning-is-healthy-practical-insurer/,"DEATH TALKS: End-of-life planning is healthy, practical–insurer","UNDOUBTEDLY, the Covid-19 crisis is a very tragic part of human history to date, claiming millions of lives internationally. When this novel virus first came out in China at the latter part of 2019 and abruptly hit the rest of the world the following year, the entire globe was caught unprepared to curb its alarmingly immediate spread.Almost all the nations were not spared from the massive impact of this fatal disease, overwhelming the health systems, particularly of the Third World countries like the Philippines. This deadly virus also brought immense fear among the general public given the recorded high mortality rates over time. Mental issues also emerged due to uncertainties as to when this would end, most especially to those people with co-morbidities who are considered more susceptible to contracting such illness.The grim scenario of hospitals overflowing with patients fighting for their lives; the piling of dead bodies waiting to be cremated in private funerals homes or public crematories; and the denial of traditional, decent death rites in favor of hurried, impersonal incinerations have caused grave concern, inconvenience, distress, grief, and even trauma to both the survivors and families left behind by the deceased victims.THERE still, however, appeared a silver lining no matter how gloomy this health malady has been, according to PhilPlans Chief Sales and Marketing Officer Ronald Bautista.“When Covid-19 happened, it made us realize that there’s really a need for a memorial plan or a proper memorial service,” he said during a panel discussion at the PhilPlans’ 35th Anniversary: Empowered Entrepreneur Bazaar event that was held in Makati City last April 17, 2024.In fact, he told reporters that the memorial plan, which used to be the least performer among their three products pre-Covid period, has become the leader from its onset to post-pandemic, accounting for up to 65 percent of their total sales. Pension and education plans now rank at second (30 percent) and third (5 percent), respectively.“We’re thankful that since the pandemic, there has been openness to everybody,” Pearl Siasoco, area manager at Siasoco & Associates, noted of the positive market reception on memorial plans at present.Needless to say, such insurance products need further pushing to Filipinos who openly value and celebrate familial ties, but discreet when it comes to discussion about death.“For generations, Filipino families have prioritized strong bonds, yet a crucial conversation has often been left unspoken,” said PhilPlans Assistant Vice President Edgardo P. Aytona. “The tide is turning. We’re thrilled to see more Filipinos recognizing the importance of pre-planning for end-of-life needs. By taking the time to discuss and plan preferences, families can navigate this difficult time with greater emotional and logistical ease, allowing them to focus on cherishing the memory of their dearly beloved.”PLANNING ahead for death goes far beyond the practicalities of arranging one’s funeral.Thinking about resting in peace could be detrimental to mental and well-being, especially for those who are sick. So for memorial planholders, they need not have to worry on their burial, thus relieving them from the stress or anxiety on whether their death wish and will be granted. Feeling secured and fulfilled, this could somehow positively impact them physically, emotionally and psychologically.On the part of their dependents, it would be painful to lose their loved ones, much more of the urgent need to make important decisions about their final desires. Unplanned passing can leave families in emotional turmoil, not to mention struggling with financial encumbrances and contradicting choices. Hence, it’s unhealthy not only to their hearts, but also to their families’ financial status and relationship.PhilPlans understands the sensitive issue of end-of-life planning given the still conservative Filipino culture. Nevertheless, the insurer believes it’s a family matter that needs to be discussed because the pros outweigh the cons. To allay fears and discomfort about pre-planning, the industry leader offers various tips on how to start these conversations with sensitivity.Start small, per the firm, by sharing your thoughts on deathcare options, like cremation or memorial gardens. Then, focus on honoring loved one’s death wishes. Next, listen with empathy through acknowledging the emotional weight of the topic and creating a safe space for open communication.TO get started with the planning for death, PhilPlans suggest the proper gathering of information on different pre-need plan options and their benefits. The company offers a variety of customizable packages to suit individual needs.In initiating the conversation, choose a calm and private moment to talk to dear ones. Work together with them by talking about preferences for end-of-life care, funeral arrangements, and memorial services.Don’t forget to document your wishes. Writing down your preferences for medical care, financial matters, funeral arrangements, and other pertinent details guarantees that your wishes are known and followed.Not to be ignored, of course, is consultation with professionals. Through the guidance of a team of experienced estate planners, lawyers and financial advisors, you are assured that each pre-planning aspect is handled effectively, giving you the confidence that your final wants will be carried out smoothly.“No one understands your journey better than you do. By proactively planning, you provide your loved ones with a roadmap on how to honor your legacy with warmth and affection,” said PhilPlans President and Chief Executive Officer Jaime B. Dizon.“Consider the relief you could offer to your friends and family. By sparing them from tough decisions during an emotional time, you give them the space to reminisce and celebrate their fond memories of you, knowing they are fulfilling your final wishes exactly the way you wanted it to be. It is a profound act of love and a final gift to those you cherish,” he added.Image credits: Roderick L.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/25/healthway-cancer-care-hospital-offers-world-class-cancer-care-at-affordable-prices/,Healthway Cancer Care Hospital offers world-class cancer care at affordable prices,"For AC Health, the dream was to bring world class cancer care to the Philippines but at affordable prices. That dream is now a reality with the Healthway Cancer Care Hospital (HCCH) which opened its doors to patients in February 2024.Strategically located in Arca South, Taguig City, HCCH is just a 20-minute drive from the airport. It provides a comprehensive range of services, including consultations, imaging chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. In its inaugural months, it has already served hundreds of patients addressing a wide spectrum of cancer cases, from colorectal and breast to lung and head and neck cancers, catering to patients of all ages.“This is what will distinguish this facility. It offers world class cancer service with partnerships with international groups such as Siemens, AstraZeneca, Roche, MSD, National Cancer Center of Singapore and so many more. It’s world class quality cancer services at more affordable prices so that we can cater to more Filipinos who are undergoing cancer,” related Paolo Borromeo, President and CEO of AC Health, during a recent media roundtable discussion.HCCH prioritizes patient comfort and well-being with superior recovery facilities, including 100 beds and a 12-bed Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The hospital features an integrated outpatient department with a specialized women’s health unit, ensuring comprehensive care. Its advanced cancer imaging center offers leading interventional oncology, radiology, and nuclear medicine procedures, aiding in early cancer detection.The cancer treatment units boast a fully-equipped radiation oncology section with Varian’s latest Linear Accelerator and 18 chemotherapy infusion hubs for administering chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Additionally, the hospital houses four specialized operating theaters, two advanced endoscopy rooms, and other ancillary services to support patient needs.“We invested heavily in state-of-the art equipment. Our main machines, diagnostic and radiation therapy are in partnership with Siemens and Varian. We are confident that with our partnership with Siemens, we have the best possible technology that we can use for diagnosis and radiation,” Borromeo added.The hospital’s Centers of Excellence (COE) program provides comprehensive care for various cancer types, covering the entire spectrum from screening to survivorship focusing on four key areas—breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and head and neck cancer. It also offers specialized cancer programs for pediatric oncology, gynecologic oncology, hematologic oncology, and among others.Going beyond conventional pain and nutrition management, it distinguishes itself with its groundbreaking Quality of Life (QOL) program—the first of its kind in the country. This holistic initiative addresses all facets of patient well-being, including psychosocial support, from diagnosis through treatment and beyond. Seamlessly integrated with the COE program, the QOL initiative ensures that patients receive comprehensive care tailored to their individual needs.When necessary, patients can be paired with a dedicated patient navigator, guaranteeing a comforting and supportive experience throughout their journey. By consolidating comprehensive cancer care services under one roof, it not only elevates patient care standards but also eliminates the need for patients to seek treatment overseas or move between different hospitals.“As we continue to champion personalized cancer care and cost-conscious services, we are committed to make a difference in terms of the lives of our patients. I also wanted to highlight the fact that our pricing strategy here is to provide the most competitive rates for Filipinos,” Borromeo said.Jaime Ysmael, Healthway Medical Network President and CEO, added that HCCH is also “leveraging on the integrated network that we are creating, enabled by technology.”“We are actually investing in a hospital information system, electronic medical records system that will unify across the network. This is how we deliver care, a multidisciplinary integrated practice approach which we call connected care circle,” Ysmaeil said.Dr. Ramy Roxas, HCCH Medical Director, pointed out that since HCCH is part of a network with six other hospitals, clinics in the malls and corporate clinics, this set up would be ideal to implement screening programs among the network.“We hope that cancer screening will become the norm and we will start this with our network employees. We can start with the corporate clinics that we run, and then move on to the hospital or Apex hospital,” Dr. Roxas explained.Ysmael added that the network will change the way cancer screening is done. This will help get more accurate detection of cancer.“The power of our network is the pool of doctors that are at our disposal, opening up communication lines and tapping into their expertise and referrals,” he added.With over 188,000 cases diagnosed annually and financial barriers hindering treatment, HCCH strives to offer cost effective rates for cancer screening, diagnostics, and treatment, expanding access to care.“The Healthway Cancer Care Hospital is an affirmation of our commitment at AC Health to improve cancer services in the country. Our vision is to lead in cancer care, providing world-class treatment at a lower cost, thus extending the best value to a wider base of Filipinos,” shared Borromeo."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/25/leading-the-way-precision-imaging-sets-new-standards-in-cancer-diagnosis/,Leading the Way: Precision Imaging Sets New Standards in Cancer Diagnosis,"Chong Hua Hospital is dedicated to achieving its mission to provide excellent patient-centered care with state-of the art equipment, as well as advanced high-quality services in the Visayas region.On January 31, 2024, Chong Hua Hospital launched the first Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET-CT scan in the whole Visayas and Mindanao.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/25/new-clinical-trials-recruitment-model-powered-by-ai-blockchain-launched-in-phl/,"New clinical trials recruitment model powered by AI, blockchain launched in PHL","REVOLUTIONIZING medical research in the country, the Philippine Alliance of Patient Organizations (PAPO) has teamed up with Care.Trials Inc. (CTI) to launch a new model of patient engagement in clinical trials with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technologies.With their partnership, CTI’s solution is designed in a way that even a grandmother can explore it in just a couple of minutes. It features anonymous browsing of trials; simple mechanisms for liking and connecting with trials; pre-screening capabilities; unbiased advocacy; and a strict no pressure policy, ensuring no unsolicited emails or messages.According to CTI Chief Executive Officer Pradeep Goel, their tie up is meant to connect patients directly with clinical trial research, while ensuring their privacy and engagement as well as producing efficient outcomes. Together, they reinvent the enrollment process for clinical studies, making it more efficient for both patients and research teams. “[It is] a whole new approach that is rooted in empowering and engaging the patient without mining their data and earning patient trust by protecting them and advocating on their behalf,” he said. “At the same time, we bring powerful new tools to study teams to identify and connect with the right patient and effectively determine if they are suitable and eligible to participate. Our goal is to accelerate research such that cures for all diseases can be found faster.”For PAPO President Karen Alparce-Villanueva, their collaborative effort signifies their mission to empower Filipino patients by arming them with the right tools they need to advocate for their rights and actively get involve in their health care. “By integrating Care.Trials’ innovative technology, we are enhancing our network’s strength and activity, enabling patients to become more informed and productive members of society,” she noted.What comes nextBEING a leading group championing for patient rights and welfare in the Philippines, PAPO serves as a strong and active network of patient groups that empowers more than 50 disease-specific groups of patients nationwide.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/25/drop-in-chronic-kidney-disease-in-type-2-diabetes-seen-with-new-drug/,Drop in Chronic Kidney Disease in Type 2 Diabetes seen with new drug,"A medical expert is optimistic about the potential drop in the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) cases in the country over the next five to 10 years.Dr. Ronald Perez, the Head of Nephrology and Hemodialysis Unit at Capitol Medical Center, said during a press briefing at Bayer Philippines on April 23, 2024, that there is currently an annual estimated rise of 10 to 12 percent in chronic kidney disease patients who require dialysis. However, he expressed confidence in reducing this figure to 5 to 6 percent per annum with the introduction of the latest treatment approach for managing CKD in Type 2 Diabetes, known as Firenone (Firialta).“I hope that we will be able to raise awareness that there is hope in decreasing or curbing the chronic kidney disease patients,” he said.Dr. Perez emphasized the prospect of fewer patients requiring dialysis or kidney transplants.“Although this is not a quick fix, but we will realize that in the next 10 years,” he said. He also noted that this anticipated decline would alleviate the strain on the healthcare sector and the release PhilHealth funds, allowing for increased allocation towards other healthcare resources.Based on the 2023 PhilHealth report, more than P17 billion is being spent to cover dialysis costs of Filipinos, which supports over three million dialysis claims. Dr. Perez presented the Fidelio (focuses on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD and T2D) and Figaro (concentrates on renal outcomes in patients with CKD and T2D) trials.A total of 13,000 patients were randomized globally, with around 6,000 in Fidelio and 7,500 in Figaro. In terms of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, Finerenone demonstrated a 14 percent reduced risk of CV morbidity and mortality compared to the placebo. This reduction in risk encompassed various events such as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalization due to heart failure.Regarding kidney outcomes, the study assessed the time to kidney failure or a sustained decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) of more than 57 percent from baseline, as well as kidney-related death. Patients treated with Finerenone showed a notable 23 percent decrease in EGFR, indicating a reduction in the progression to CKD and the need for dialysis.The EGFR blood test is a measure of how well your kidneys are working. The eGFR is an estimated number based on a blood test and your age, sex and body type.Furthermore, the study demonstrated a significant reduction in CKD progression with Finerenone treatment compared to placebo. Specifically, Finerenone led to a 32 percent decrease in the urine-albumin failure ratio between baseline and the end of the four-month treatment period.Meanwhile, Dr. Perez’s patients, who participated in a medical trial conducted between 2015 and 2019 in The Medical City, faced challenges due to the limited availability of suitable candidates. With ongoing trials globally, particularly in China, which had a significant population, the Philippines encountered difficulties in enrolling patients, especially those with chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4. Despite these enrollment challenges, patients who received the experimental drug experienced a notable 50 percent reduction in albuminuria, without any instances of dialysis initiation during the study. However, there was a risk of increased serum potassium levels with the drug venerenone, necessitating careful monitoring due to the potential lethality of potassium to heart muscles. Dr. Perez emphasized the critical importance of managing potassium levels, highlighting its lethal effects, akin to those in lethal injections where potassium chloride is administered. It is noted that no patients died during the trial period.However, in 2021, statistics from the International Diabetes Federation revealed that 4.3 million Filipino adults are living with diabetes.Research indicated that about one-third of adult patients with diabetes also experience CKD due to T2D, equating to roughly 1.43 million CKD patients. Meanwhile, data from the National Kidney and Transplant Institute (NKTI) further illustrated that roughly one Filipino develops chronic renal failure every hour, contributing to an estimated 7 million Filipinos grappling with CKD.Bayer Philippines Medical Director of Pharmaceutical Carmela Luisa Pagunsan emphasized that this newest treatment pillar, when integrated with the current standard of care, represents a significant step towards slowing down the progression of CKD. This, in turn, alleviates the burden on patients and their families who are already grappling with various physical, emotional, and financial challenges associated with multiple complications.When BusinessMirror asked about the possibility of combining Firenone with other medications for CKD management, given that CKD often arises from hypertension and diabetes, it was confirmed that such a combination is feasible. Firenone, being a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, has been researched for its ability to mitigate inflammation and fibrosis in the kidneys, thereby reducing the risk of kidney failure. Patients can concurrently use medications for hypertension and diabetes alongside Firenone.When BusinessMirror asked about the precautions with the administration of the firenone, Dr. Perez outlined the monitoring of serum creatinine levels and ensuring patient protection. If serum creatinine levels increase by more than 30 percent, clinicians should consider discontinuing finerenone. Additionally, potassium levels should not exceed 4.8 millimoles per liter. Exceeding these levels necessitates stopping the drug and observing for two weeks before potential re-administration. Persistent elevation suggests advanced diabetic kidney disease, rendering the drug ineffective. Regarding dietary interactions, Perez advised limiting fruit intake due to potassium concerns and suggested reducing protein consumption to 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, approximately equivalent to two matchbox-sized servings of pork or beef, one drumstick of chicken, or one pound of fish per meal.Dr. Perez further added that while he does not discourage the use of herbal medicine and holds no bias against them, he does caution against their indiscriminate combination. His concern lies in the potential interactions between various herbal remedies when combined into a single concoction or drug, which can exacerbate side effects or nullify their intended benefits. On the other hand, Pagunsan, further emphasized the importance of avoiding regular use of over-the-counter pills, as many of them can be toxic to the kidneys. Specifically, she warned against the use of Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), a type of pain reliever commonly known for its potential kidney toxicity.Image credits:"

He noted: “BLC has conveniently brought cutting-edge technology to Western Visayas, reaffirming our mission to provide life-changing vision services to every corner of the country.”For BLC Chief Executive Officer and Head Ophthalmologist Dr. Ches Heredia, the Bacolod satellite clinic mainly aims to do comprehensive eye screenings for interested patients.“If the assessment indicates their eligibility for Lasik, we then schedule their procedure at our Iloilo clinic. This eliminates the need for patients to travel extensively for follow-up appointments. Instead, they can simply cross to Iloilo (via ferry) for their surgery and return to Bacolod for follow-up check-ups at our satellite clinic,” he said.SHORT for Laser-Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis, Lasik is a kind of refractive surgery for the correction of myopia, hyperopia, and an actual cure for astigmatism since it is in the cornea. Commonly referred to as laser eye surgery or laser vision correction, it serves as an alternative to wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses.“Our dedication to excellence in vision care extends beyond accessibility; it encompasses our unwavering commitment to utilizing cutting-edge technology and delivering customized treatments to each patient,” said BLC Chief Operating Officer Dr. Ricky Aranzamendez III. The Lasik center boasts of top-of-the-line machines that perform the best ophthalmic treatments. One of which is the Schwind Amaris Excimer Laser, a high-performance laser system used in refractive surgery to reshape the cornea and correct vision problems such as myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), and astigmatism.“With over 20,000 eyes already transformed under our care, our globally-trained and highly-experienced doctors stand ready to continue this legacy of life-changing vision,” he stressed.Existing and prospective clients of Borough Lasik Center Bacolod can avail of its opening promo for limited slots on free comprehensive eye screenings and exclusive all-in Lasik packages from as low as P50,000.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/25/for-makati-medical-center-the-future-is-now-with-acquisition-of-da-vinci-xi-robotic-system/,"For Makati Medical Center, the future is now with acquisition of da Vinci XI Robotic System","Back in 2010, premier hospital Makati Medical Center had wanted to acquire a robotic surgical system to live up to its vision of being the leading healthcare facility in the country with top notch service, expertise and technology.At that time, it was disapproved because there were other priorities that needed to be addressed. These priorities, according to Dr. Saturnino P. Javier, Medical Director and Interim Co-President and CEO of Makati Medical Center, were “very basic, simple needs that the hospital had to address on top of the robotics platform.”“But comparing that time to today, many things have changed. If you put in that robotics technology last week, there are people who can use it already. Back in 2010, the doctors were on their learning curve. Today, it is different,” Dr. Javier said during the launch of the da Vinci Robotic System.He added that “because we allowed it to slip through our hands, another hospital benefitted from it and keep in mind that those doctors who operate, a good number of them are MakatiMed based.”“So another hospital took advantage of the expertise of our own doctors to make this platform work,” Dr. Javier said.Another reason for pushing for the acquisition of the system is that MakatiMed wanted to offer an option to patients. He pointed out that patients have preferences and he sometimes “heaves a sigh of frustration whenever I learn that someone has been transferred to another hospital because the equipment is not available in MakatiMed.”“We want to make sure that our line of equipment is complete so that we don’t have any more leakages to other hospitals. We will give our patients the complete line of options from which to choose from,” he said, adding that the hospital will couple the technology with the kind of compassionate service that the hospital is known for.“I think the difference lies in terms of who drives the technology and when I saw who drives it or who uses it, it’s the doctors, the team, the nursing team who will all be part of the operators group using that particular technology. So the technology is just one aspect of the care. You still need to have the compassionate service and the expertise,” Dr. Javier added.For him, the acquisition of the robotic system cements MakatiMed’s position as the leading hospital not only in the country but in the Metro Pacific Health group of hospitals as well.“So far, MakatiMed is the only hospital in the Metro Pacific Health group that has the robotic surgery platform,” he added.The da Vinci Xi Robotic Surgery System offers several advantages. It allows surgeons to make smaller incisions, reducing the risk of infection and promoting faster healing. Patients experience less pain and discomfort, leading to shorter hospital stays and quicker recoveries. This means they can return to their normal routines sooner, with minimal scarring and reduced need for blood transfusions. The da Vinci System is versatile as it caters to treatments in the fields of urology, hepatobiliary, cardiovascular, thoracic, and general surgery, OB-Gyne, and otorhinolaryngology or ENT. In each area, it enables surgeons to perform procedures with greater precision and minimally invasive techniques. This groundbreaking advancement in surgical technology means that patients now have the option to receive this precision surgical care at MakatiMed, setting a new standard for surgical excellence in the Philippines. Beyond technological advancements, MakatiMed prides itself on its unwavering dedication to providing compassionate care, ensuring that every patient receives personalized attention throughout their surgical journey—saving time and resources through a holistic service. With the introduction of the da Vinci Xi® Robotic System, MakatiMed marks a significant milestone towards shaping the future of surgery. Patients can trust they are in good hands, receiving top-notch care with the latest technology available."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/25/asian-hospital-extends-medical-services-through-heal-program/,Asian Hospital extends medical services through HEAL Program,"To ensure that its quality healthcare services reach as many Filipinos as possible, premier medical institution Asian Hospital and Medical Center, has a referral program that targets private and government institutions.Launched in June 2023, the HEAL or Hospital Engagement and Alliance Linkage Program is Asian Hospital’s referral program that is designed to establish impactful partnerships with private and government hospitals, clinics, lying ins, dialysis centers and other healthcare providers.“Our mission is to enhance patient care continuity by providing access to specialized services,” explained Hennesy Lou Miranda, Asian Hospital’s Director for Marketing and Patient Experience.“The good thing about our HEAL Program is that Asian Hospital complements and extends existing services of the referring institution through this collaboration. We tailor our support to address the unique needs of their patients and bring them back to them,” she added.This arrangement brings benefits to both Asian Hospital and the referring institution. It also contributes to the success of the program which results in building the foundation for collaborative growth.“One of the benefits of this program is that the HEAL partner doctors can be credentialed to practice at Asian Hospital through the collaboration with the Medical Affairs Unit. They also get invitations to exclusive events like lay fora, scientific symposiums, lectures, networking opportunities,” explained Ramil Camanag, Asian Hospital’s Senior Manager for Strategic Partnerships.He added that the program also offers preferential rates to partner hospitals as well as a direct billing arrangement to HEAL partners. This allows HEAL partners to focus on addressing their patient’s needs.“What is important here is that we offer continuity of care for specialized procedures such as Tomotherapy and Brachytherapy to government hospital cancer patients with our No Balance Billing,” Camanag added.As of April 2024, Asian Hospital has served 57 patients from government hospitals from November 2023 to March 2024 for the “No Balance Billing Tomotherapy and Brachytherapy” procedures of the Asian Cancer Institute for cancer cases of the cervix, endometrium, breast, brain, lung, maxilla nasopharynx, and rectum.Asian Hospital also entertains patients from nursing homes and hospital partners with close collaboration with the Emergency Department, Outpatient/Inpatient Navigation Team to address patients’ emergency needs.Additionally, Asian Hospital addresses the needs of hospital partners for specimen referrals not available in their institutions with proactive communication on relaying details and information of Pathology and Laboratory and Nuclear Medicine to HEAL Patients.“We are strengthening the HEAL Program by offering specialty experts and services from our Centers for Excellence like the Asian Cardiovascular Center and the Asian Cancer Institute, our new machines like the 256 slice CT Scan which delivers the fastest CT scans and improved imaging with low dose radiation,” Miranda said.She added that the hospital also plans to expand the partnerships to other hospitals as well.“We plan to expand the partnerships not limited to our Metro Pacific Health group of hospitals but also to other group of hospital networks. We are also starting to reach out not only to Luzon healthcare partners but also to other provinces in the Visayas like Cebu and Iloilo,” Miranda said.To partner with AHMC’s HEAL contact the Strategic Partnerships Unit at (02) 8 7719000 local 8091 / 8631; 0919-3119738 / 0995- 981 3004 and heal@asianhospital.com."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/25/phl-is-a-complex-inspiring-case-study-in-sexual-reproductive-health-rights-unfpa/,"PHL is a complex, inspiring case study in sexual, reproductive health, rights–UNFPA","Despite global gains in sexual and reproductive health and rights over the last 30 years, millions of women and girls, including Filipinas, have been deprived of access and opportunities, according to the 2024 State of World Population report, released recently by UNFPA, the United Nations’ sexual and reproductive health agency.In its report titled, “Interwoven Lives, Threads of Hope: Ending inequalities in sexual and reproductive health and rights,” gender inequality and other forms of discrimination have thwarted the broad gains in sexual and reproductive health for women and girls. Women and girls who are poor, belong to ethnic, racial and indigenous minority groups, or are trapped in conflict settings, are more likely to die because they lack access to timely health care.As far as the Philippines is concerned, UNFPA Philippines Country Representative Dr. Leila Joudane pointed out that it is a paradox because of the several contradictions.“The Philippines serves as a complex, and in many ways, inspiring case study. We’ve seen significant advances in some areas, yet profound inequalities persist,” she said.“Access to contraception, reductions in maternal death, and the continued fight for gender equality are successes to be honored. Yet we know the fight for sexual and reproductive health and rights is far from over, especially for marginalized communities, young people, and those left furthest behind,” she added.The Philippines has made strides when it comes to maternal and reproductive health since 1994. Antenatal care for women increased by 30 percent (from 53 to 83 percent), unmet need for Family Planning has been halved (from 30 to 12 percent), and important laws like such as the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012, the Act Prohibiting the Practice of Child Marriage, and many others have been enacted.Over half of all preventable maternal deaths are estimated to occur in countries with humanitarian crises and conflicts; that’s nearly 500 deaths per day. Women from indigenous ethnic groups are more likely to die of causes related to pregnancy and childbirth.Women with disabilities are up to 10 times more likely to experience gender-based violence than their peers without disabilities. People of diverse sexual orientation and gender expression face rampant violence and steep barriers to care.“This report underscores a sobering truth: inequalities are widening and the rights of women, girls, and gender-diverse people face increasing pushbacks. This report delves into the critical issues that continue to shape our world and provides a roadmap for realizing the promises we made in Cairo for the International Conference on Population and Development [30 years ago],” explained Joudane during the local launch of the report at the University of the Philippines.The event, attended by government officials such as those from the National Economic and Development Authority and the Commission on Population and Development, also celebrated the 30th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). From a focus on population control, the ICPD was pivotal in convincing the world’s nations to prioritize reproductive justice by recognizing the rights and choices of individuals—especially women and girls—to make informed choices about their bodies, their lives, and their futures. Through the ICPD in 1994, 179 governments, including that of the Philippines, committed to placing sexual and reproductive health and rights at the core of sustainable development.Further, UNFPA Philippines presented additional data on how access to family planning, especially among the poorest or lowest socioeconomic quintile, has greatly expanded due to the implementation of the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012. Nevertheless, while the law improved access for economically disadvantaged women, it has also resulted in lower access to family planning among adolescents due to the need for parental consent.UNFPA Deputy Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific Dr. Aleksandar Sasha Bodiroza, said the report is “a celebration of progress and a stark reminder of the work that remains.”“Millions of women and girls remain far behind, and progress is slowing or stalled on key measures: 800 women die every day giving birth, unchanged since 2016; a quarter of women cannot make her own health-care decisions and around the same number cannot say no to sex with their partner. In 40 percent of countries with data, women’s bodily autonomy is diminishing,” Bodiroza said.Rizal Raoul S. Reyes has covered technology, science, business, property and special reports.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/25/go-bats-for-improved-public-health-services/,Go bats for improved public health services,"Senate Committee of Health and Demography Chairman Senator Christopher “Bong” Go personally joined the celebration of World Liver Day at the Philippine Children’s Medical Center (PCMC) in Quezon City last April 19, 2024.In his speech, Senator Go talked about the success of the Pediatric Access to Liver Transplant (PasLit) program which he initiated during the administration of former President Rodrigo Duterte.The program has significantly benefitted numerous children and is part of a broader consortium involving the Office of the President, the Department of Health, PCMC, and The Medical City (TMC). This collaboration provides comprehensive medical support for pediatric liver patients, enhancing the country’s capacity for life-saving transplant procedures.Highlighting the event were the touching accounts of two recipients of the PasLit program. The first, Sophie Aguilo, a six-year-old diagnosed with biliary atresia, underwent a successful liver transplant on November 17, 2020. As the first patient-beneficiary of the program and one of the few liver transplant recipients at TMC, Sophie had her regular follow-ups at PCMC and was reported to have no complaints during her last check-up last February 14.The second story shared was that of three-year-old Gianna Visto, also diagnosed with biliary atresia, who received her liver transplant last February 22 at TMC with her mother as the donor. Gianna is reportedly doing well post-operation.“This PasLit program is only available here in the Philippines. Between Medical City, PCMC and DOH, we already have two success stories I felt some tightness in my chest when I saw them earlier. However, when I learned of their success stories, it made me feel a little better because there is hope and we can help more patients because of this program,” shared Go in an interview. In line with his advocacy for improved public health services especially for the poor, Go explained that the reason for the program is to enhance medical training programs and services for treating liver diseases such as biliary atresia in the country.“I was frequent visitor of PCMC before. There were a lot of parents who bring their children here to seek treatment. The parents beg for help. But we cannot balme them because some of them what to have their procedure done abroad like in India. It is cheaper there,” Go said, citing how PasLit program started.With this, he stressed the importance of local treatment options to prevent patients from seeking medical attention abroad, thereby making healthcare more accessible and timely for Filipino children.“Now, they have a choice. They have a choice to be treated in the Philippines. We have a lot of very good and well-trained doctors. We already have many good facilities like PCMC and we already have private hospitals like The Medical City. This is the reason why we came up with the program so that there is hope for them,” he shared. The head of TMC’s Liver Disease Management and Transplantation, Dr. Vanessa de Villa appreciated Senator Go for supporting the PasLit program.“I am very thank for this because it is true to your mandate that you promote this program and promote Filipino healthcare. You could have extended financial assistance so that patients can seek treatment abroad. That, however, will not help the Philippines’ progress,” Dr. de Villa explained. “And I will speak for myself, from my hospital. It is an important matter that we think of our country, we think for the Filipinos. Let’s think of who we should be helping—our fellow Filipinos or foreigners? We can achive all this if we come together and help each other,” Dr. de Villa further shared.During his visit, Go extended financial assistance, grocery packs, basketballs and volleyballs to select patients. Meanwhile, his Malasakit Team organized a feeding program for the hospital’s patients and watchers."

New heat warning system signals extreme danger,"Forget about red hot. A new color-coded heat warning system relies on magenta to alert Americans to the most dangerous conditions they may see this summer.The National Weather Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday — Earth Day — presented a new online heat risk system that combines meteorological and medical risk factors with a seven-day forecast that’s simplified and color-coded for a of “For the first time we’ll be able to know how hot is too hot for health and not just for today but for coming weeks,” Dr. Ari Bernstein, director of the National Center for Environmental Health, said at a joint news conference by government health and weather agencies.Magenta is the worst and deadliest of five heat threat categories, hitting everybody with what the agencies are calling “rare and/or long-duration extreme heat with little to no overnight relief.” It’s a step higher than red, considered a major risk, which hurts anyone without adequate cooling and hydration and has impacts reverberating through the health care system and some industries. Red is used when a day falls within the top 5% hottest in a particular location for a particular date; when other factors come into play, the alert level may bump even higher to magenta, weather service officials said.On the other hand, pale green is little to no risk. Yellow is minor risk, mostly to the very young, old, sick and pregnant. Orange is moderate risk, mostly hurting people who are sensitive to heat, especially those without cooling, such as the homeless.The five categories rest on strict science-set numerical thresholds, like the Saffir Simpson hurricane scale that is familiar for its Category 1 through 5 terminology, though the heat version is specific to location, said National Weather Service Director Ken Graham. The thresholds were calculated using local weather data, local climatology that shows what people are used to at certain locations at each time of year, and localized heath and medical data for when heat illnesses and deaths show up in the area, he said.“Heat is a threat to our health,” CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen said. She said last year more than 120,000 people were taken to the emergency room in the United States because of heat. Last year was one of the deadliest years in decades for heat, according to government records.Heat is by far the No. 1 weather cause of death in the United States, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Rick Spinrad, citing CDC data of 1,200 deaths per year. Last year was the Both the weather service and CDC will put versions of the tool on their websites. Enter a ZIP code on the to get more focus on health risks and air quality and zoom in on the online for more detailed forecasts and explanations. Both versions include heat risk for the next seven days and there is a . The CDC site is and the weather service version is There are numerous other meteorological indexes for heat, Graham said. Those include the , which factors in humidity; , which is aimed at outdoors heat stress in the sun; and , which brings in radiation and other urban heat factors.“This is a way to simplify that,” Graham said. “You’ve got to be able to simplify the stuff so that people actually want to look at it first of all and most importantly understand it.”A version of the heat risk map has been in use in California and other parts of the West for about a decade, he said.Health officials Cohen and Bernstein said even as heat gets worse with climate change, society can try to reduce deaths by better warnings and better planning. Doctors should talk with people before the summer begins about what vulnerable people should do in advance before heat waves, they said. For example, some heart medications interact with outdoor heat and people shouldn’t stop taking their medications, but they could take other precautions, as can teenagers with asthma, said Bernstein, a pediatrician by training.Those precautions will be needed soon, Graham said.The Weather Service’s for May and June shows likely above-average temperatures for much of the United States, Graham said. “So as summer approaches, it’s going to be as hot as ever and even more so if we get above average.”“Heat waves are getting hotter, longer, more frequent and you’re getting less relief at night,” Graham said, citing numerous studies in the past decade. “So it’s becoming increasingly serious.”Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/20/health-and-wellness-corporate-giveaways-promote-well-being-among-employees/,Health and wellness corporate giveaways promote well-being among employees,"Every good employer wants to foster a health-conscious workplace culture for their employees. After all, when employees are given the time to focus on their health and wellness, they get to come to work feeling refreshed and recharged. There are a lot of strategies employers can implement to encourage their employees to take great care of their well-being. One of which is through health and wellness . These incentives can help employees improve their social, physical, and mental health while also giving them the motivation to live a healthier lifestyle. If you’re looking for items that make great health and wellness giveaways for your employees, consider the following:Water bottles are essential for staying hydrated throughout the day, especially in a busy work environment. Thus, using high-quality water bottles during corporate giveaways is a great way to promote hydration in the workplace. Look for durable, BPA-free bottles with convenient features like flip-up straws or leak-proof lids. You should also choose water bottles made from eco-friendly and sustainable materials to help reduce your employees’ environmental impact. Moreover, consider customizing the bottles with your company logo for added brand visibility and loyalty.Workout gear such as resistance bands, yoga mats, and foam rollers make excellent corporate giveaway items for several reasons. For one thing, they can encourage physical activity among employees and motivate them into leading a healthy lifestyle, including increased energy levels and improved mood. Additionally, workout gear can enhance their flexibility and strength as they go about their training. With these items, your employees can stay both physically and mentally fit. Fitness gadgets have become increasingly popular for tracking activity levels and providing valuable insights into one’s health. Gadgets such as fitness trackers and smartwatches are often used to monitor statistics like the number steps taken, the amount of calories burned, and sleep patterns. Thanks to their functions, these gadgets make perfect giveaway items that can encourage your employees to engage in physical activities and set doable fitness goals.Promoting healthy eating habits among employees can also contribute to overall wellness and productivity. A great way to do this is to offer small kitchen appliances such as air fryers, blender bottles, or salad spinners as corporate giveaways. These appliances make it easier for employees to prepare nutritious meals and snacks at home. Plus, when more employees have these small kitchen appliances, they can share healthy recipes and tips for meal planning and preparation, encouraging healthy eating habits as a result.Providing employees with access to nutritious meal plans can support their overall health and wellness goals. Offering subscriptions to meal delivery services or partnering with nutritionists allows you to create customized meal plans tailored to employees’ dietary preferences and goals. Healthy meal plans can also help employees save time on meal preparation, make healthier food choices, and maintain balanced nutrition. By promoting healthy eating habits, you can contribute to a positive workplace culture and improve employee satisfaction and productivity.Participating in running events, such as 5K races or marathons, can be a fun and motivating way for employees to stay active and build camaraderie. That’s why giving away admissions to local running events can provide your employees with the opportunity to join these events and not worry about the sign-up fees. Doing so not only promotes physical activity but also fosters teamwork and a sense of accomplishment.Investing in employee wellness by offering gym memberships as corporate giveaways can have long-lasting benefits for both individuals and the organization. Access to a gym provides employees with a variety of fitness equipment, classes, and amenities to support their health and fitness goals. Look for gym facilities that are conveniently located near the workplace and offer flexible membership options. Consider subsidizing or fully covering the cost of memberships to remove barriers to participation and promote a culture of wellness.Subscriptions to meditation apps or online platforms provide your employees with access to guided meditation, mindfulness practices, and relaxation techniques that they can use anytime, anywhere. These subscriptions can also encourage them to incorporate meditation into their daily routines, helping them manage their stress levels, improve their focus, and enhance their overall well-being. What’s more, giving away meditation subscriptions demonstrates your commitment to supporting your employees’ mental and emotional health, leading to greater resilience and productivity in the workplace.Stress management is crucial for employee well-being. That’s why relaxation gift boxes give them the tools to unwind and recharge, providing them with a moment of relaxation that can have a positive impact on their productivity, creativity, and overall job satisfaction. Items that you can add to these gift boxes include scented candles, essential oils, bath bombs, and relaxation teas. Treat your employees to a day of pampering and self-care with spa gift vouchers. Spa treatments such as massages, facials, and manicures offer physical and mental rejuvenation, helping employees alleviate stress and tension. Partner with local spas or wellness centers to offer discounted or complimentary services to your employees. Spa gift vouchers can serve as a thoughtful gesture to show appreciation for their hard work and dedication.Offering thoughtful and practical corporate giveaways aimed at improving one’s well-being can create a culture of wellness that benefits both your employees and the company as a whole. By caring about the health and happiness of your workforce, you can foster a positive work environment and improve employee engagement and retention—ultimately driving business success."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/04/18/caap-told-shape-up-on-davao-airport/,CAAP told: Shape up on Davao airport,"DAVAO CITY—The city government expressed its dismay on the management of the airport here and told the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines XI “to act swiftly and improve the facilities and services” at the Davao International Airport.The city government issued the call on Tuesday and posted it on its website after it took notice of a string of comments from Davao residents and visitors on the state of airport facilities.“This has been a recurring issue. The local government has constantly raised these concerns to the CAAP XI, which is the agency mandated to manage the Davao International Airport, yet we see no significant improvement until today [Tuesday],” the city government said.The complaints ranged from poor or no water services at the rest rooms and untidy floors to poor air conditioning system, poor lighting inside the building and lack of push carts.The city government said that while it has no direct control over the DIA, “the city government continues to support CAAP XI in various ways for the welfare of the public.”The city government said it has provided augmentation security personnel within the DIA compound to ensure the safety and security of passengers and the public, as it also disclosed that it recently turned over additional push carts.“While we acknowledge that CAAP is preparing for the transition of airport management to the Davao International Airport Authority [DIAA], it must not fall short in delivering its mandate to maintain our airport,” the statement added.Meanwhile, the City Health Office (CHO) warned that it would be exacting fines and sanctions to violators of the Davao City Mosquito Borne Disease Protection and Control Program or City Ordinance 0401 (series of 2020).CHO Tropical Division Head Melodina Babante said dialogues were now being conducted between the City Treasurer’s Office, City Legal Office and the Barangay and Cultural Communities Affairs Division in order to penalize residents whose homes or places of business are found to have mosquito breeding sites.Under the city ordinance, the dumping of old tires and batteries, as well as uncovered plastic drums, water tanks and containers are prohibited as these can become breeding sites for dengue-carrying mosquitoes, the City Information Office said.Failure to adhere mandates a P1,000 fine and a two-day community service for first-time offenders, a fine of P3,000 and a four-hour community service for the second offense; and a P5,000 fine and a four-hour community service for the third offense.Babante said the implementation of the penalties is one of the methods by which the CHO is trying to curb dengue cases which spiked in 2023.In 2022, Davao City logged 1,481 dengue cases which resulted in 21 deaths. In 2023, however, cases ballooned to 6,269 which led to 52 fatalities.From January to April 18 this year, the CHO already recorded 1,140 dengue cases which led to the death of eight people. This is higher than the six deaths logged for the same period last year.“Right now we challenge all barangays to create the said task force because for us in the Tropical Division, our everyday activity is to go to the barangays, even ones without reported cases of dengue,” Babante said.Babante said only 32 out of the 182 barangays in the city have a Dengue Task Force that monitor the cleanliness of their respective areas and actively search and destroy mosquito breeding grounds.

It is a form of cancer that originates from breast tissue. When diagnosed and treated early, breast cancer is often curable.In the Philippines, breast and ovarian cancer are two of the most prevalent types afflicting Filipinos, with breast cancer leading the incidence rate at 17.6 percent.Detoxicare Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, a subsidiary of Detoxicare Phils Inc., recently inked a partnership deal with a global, science-led, patient-focused biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. This collaboration will spearhead next-generation sequencing for breast cancer, marking a significant step forward in the fight against this debilitating disease.“Detoxicare’s commitment to making advanced diagnostics affordable and within reach has been a driving force in reshaping the landscape of healthcare accessibility,” Dr. Gjay Ordinal, President of Detoxicare Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, announced during the recent “Personalizing Her Treatment: Integrating Testing and Genetic Consenting in the Management of Women’s Cancers” event. “By combining the pharmaceutical expertise of AstraZeneca with Detoxicare’s proficiency in molecular diagnostics, we are poised to usher in a new era of personalized medicine.”Integrating advanced technologies into clinical practice will be instrumental in personalizing treatment approaches, optimizing therapeutic efficacy, and ultimately improving patient survival and quality of life.Reinforcing commitment to Filipino patients, Lotis Ramin, AstraZeneca Country President said, “We are redefining oncology in AstraZeneca, where we aspire for a future where cancer cure is possible through our life-changing medicines, alongside partnerships and ecosystem solutions that allow early detection, diagnosis, and equitable cancer care for patients.” She added, “We are grateful to Detoxicare for this collaboration that enables better access to innovative and holistic approaches that will truly deliver impactful benefits for the cancer community.” In the field of oncology, biomarker testing plays a pivotal role in identifying specific molecular characteristics of tumors and guiding treatment decisions. When combined with next-generation sequencing (NGS), medical experts gain comprehensive insights into the genetic mutations and alterations driving cancer progression, allowing for tailored treatments with unprecedented precision. This approach not only enhances treatment efficacy but also minimizes unnecessary toxicity and side effects, leading to better patient outcomes. While the partnership highlights its impact on breast cancer, the process can also be applied to other types of cancers as well. Detoxicare also offers a wide variety of testing services for various cancers including Pan Lung Cancer, a single test which detects 11 actionable genes for lung cancer, and KRAS/NRAS for colorectal cancer. Other offerings include tests for respiratory diseases such as Covid-19 and pneumonia; infectious diseases such as meningitis, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted diseases; and clinical pathology, which covers diabetes testing, lipid profiling, and hepatitis, among others.For more information about Detoxicare Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, please visit www.molecularlabph.com.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

In short, they are being wise.Things are about to change as a landmark deal was closed between UNO Digital Bank and Singlife Philippines, which could give a great number of people access to a more affordable and seamless way to safeguard their health via insurance options.Both the leading digital bank and first purely web-based insurer in the country entered into this unprecedented partnership on the back of the nation’s ascent to upper-middle-income status and the anticipated strong demand for health surety products.According to UNO Digital Bank President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Manish Bhai, their company aims to provide a trusted platform to meet the people’s financial needs.“We have already started our journey in offering multiple options to our customers to save, borrow, and transact in the past years and we are very excited to introduce this protect phase and to take the first step with Singlife Philippines. With this partnership we are one step closer to making a holistic experience for our customers,” he said.With its goal to help Filipinos on their financial wellness journey, Singlife, on its part, is excited to team up with UNO Digital Bank on this mission. “Our companies are aligned in our approach of using cutting-edge technology to solve customer pain points. We provide a better way to get access to much-needed products and help them achieve their financial goals at every life stage,” noted Singlife Philippines Cofounder and Executive Director Sherie Ng.WITH their tie-up, individuals and their families can gain from quality health insurance sans hurting their pockets with the “Cash for Medical Costs” plan that provides financial coverage for hospitalization and 125 critical conditions.The “3-in-1 Protection Plan,” on the other hand, offers affordable financial coverage against dengue, Covid-19, and accidents for as low as P79 per month. Insured individuals and their families can benefit from coverage of up to P750,000 at an affordable price.Meanwhile, the “Cash for Income Loss” gives planholders and their dependents a monthly financial aid for up to seven years in case of disability or death from an accident, thus ensuring their financial stability at a tough time.“We are committed to being Filipinos’ constant and reliable partners throughout every financial stage of life. We aim to help them achieve their financial goals, one of which is by providing affordable and accessible access to insurance plans,” Bhai said. Using UNO Digital Bank’s application, which enables users to save, borrow, pay bills, and shop, they can now directly access different affordable and comprehensive Singlife insurance options.“UNO aspires to be at the leading edge of financial innovation and bring best in class products and services to the tens of millions of ordinary Filipinos who are served by the traditional banks. The access to products and services is expected to help them improve their life by offering them flexibility, convenience, personalization, and control.Our partnership with Singlife will serve a significant step towards achieving our mission,” UNO Digital Bank Chairman Kalidas Ghose stressed.Roderick L.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/23/kate-princess-of-wales-reveals-she-has-cancer-and-is-undergoing-chemotherapy/,"Kate, Princess of Wales, reveals she has cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy ","Kate, , has cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy, she revealed Friday in that followed weeks of speculation about her health and whereabouts.The princess disclosed in a video message recorded Wednesday in Windsor and broadcast Friday. It came after relentless speculation on social media ever since January, when she was hospitalized for unspecified .Kate asked for “time, space and privacy” while she is treated for an unspecified type of cancer that was discovered after what she described as “major” surgery.Wearing a casual striped sweater and jeans, Kate sat on a wooden bench in front of a lawn dotted with daffodils. The flowers, which bloom in early spring, are often used as a symbol of hope for people fighting cancer.“I am well,” she said. “I am getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal.”Kate, 42, hadn’t been seen publicly since Christmas until of her with her husband, Prince William, heir to the throne. It showed them walking from a shop that sells produce grown on the royal family’s Windsor estate.The news is another jolt for the royal family since the announcement last month that was being treated for an unspecified type of cancer that was discovered while undergoing a procedure for a benign enlarged prostate.Charles said he is “so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did,” according to a statement released by Buckingham Palace. The king, who received prostate treatment in the same hospital and at the same time Kate had her surgery, remained in the “closest contact with his beloved daughter-in-law” in the past weeks.The king and Queen Camilla “will continue to offer their love and support to the whole family through this difficult time,” the palace said.Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, who have been estranged from William and Kate since their move to California in 2020, wished the princess well.“We wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace,” they said in a statement.Before Friday, Kensington Palace had given little detail about Kate’s condition beyond saying it wasn’t cancer-related, the surgery was successful and recuperation would keep the princess away from public duties until April. Kate said it had been thought that her condition was non-cancerous until post-surgery tests revealed the diagnosis.“This of course came as a huge shock, and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family,” she said.By choosing to speak directly to the country and the world about her condition, rather than issuing a statement through the palace, Kate offered a level of intimacy and transparency atypical of a member of the royal family and may help tamp down runaway conjecture. The king’s disclosure of his condition was also notably open by royal standards.Kate said it had taken her time to recover from the surgery before starting “preventative” treatment, which she said was in the early stages.Dr. Shivan Sivakumar, associate professor in oncology at the University of Birmingham, said it’s unclear what the princess meant by “preventative” chemotherapy but he presumed that it’s what is known as “adjuvant” chemotherapy in the medical profession.“This is chemotherapy after an operation to prevent recurrence,” he said. “This is to attempt to destroy any circulating cancer cells.”Kate said it has been “an incredibly tough couple of months” for her family. She said it had taken time to tell her three children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis in a way “appropriate for them” and reassure them she will be OK.The announcement came after the start of the Easter holidays, which will shield the children from media coverage of the news.British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement that Kate “has shown tremendous bravery.””“We are incredibly sad to hear of the news,” said White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who opened her briefing with reporters moments after news of cancer treatment broke. “We are taking this in, this terrible news, as all of you are.”Charles, 75, has withdrawn from public duties while he has cancer treatment, though he’s appeared frequently in photos carrying on meetings with government officials and dignitaries and was even seen going to church.Kate, on the other hand, had been out of view instead of appearing at charity events and promoting causes such as supporting children early in life, leading to weeks of . Attempts to put rumors to bed by releasing a photo of her on Mother’s Day in the U.K. surrounded by her three smiling children backfired when The Associated Press and other news agencies retracted the image because it had been manipulated.Kate the next day acknowledging she liked to “experiment with editing” and apologizing for “any confusion” the photo had caused. But that did little to quell the speculation.Even the footage published by The Sun and TMZ that appeared to show Kate and William shopping sparked a new flurry of rumor-mongering, with some armchair sleuths refusing to believe the video showed Kate at all.Earlier this week, a British privacy watchdog said it was investigating a report that staff at the private London hospital where she was treated tried to snoop on her medical records while she was a patient for The former Kate Middleton, who married William in a fairy-tale wedding in 2011, has boosted the popularity and appeal of the British monarchy worldwide more than any royal since Princess Diana.The princess is the oldest of three children brought up in a well-to-do neighborhood in Berkshire, west of London. The Middletons have no aristocratic background, and the British press often referred to Kate as a “commoner” marrying into royalty.Her brother James Middleton posted on Instagram: “Over the years, we have climbed many mountains together. As a family, we will climb this one with you too.”Kate attended the private school Marlborough College and then University of St. Andrews in Scotland, where she met William around 2001. Friends and housemates at first, their relationship became widely publicized when they were pictured together on a skiing holiday in Switzerland in 2004.Kate graduated in 2005 with a degree in art history and a budding relationship with the prince."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/23/what-is-known-about-kates-cancer-diagnosis/,What is known about Kate’s cancer diagnosis,"Kate, the , has disclosed that and — though in a video announcement Friday, she did not say what kind of cancer or reveal details of her treatment.Here’s what is known: had what was described as abdominal surgery on Jan. 16. The news wasn’t announced until the next day, when Kensington Palace that was recovering from a planned operation.At the time, officials said her condition wasn’t cancerous but did not specify what kind of surgery, saying only that it was successful.During the video announcement Friday, said: “Tests after the operation found cancer had been present,” and that she was in the early stages of treatment.She didn’t say what kind of cancer was found, nor did she give details of her chemotherapy. The statement from Kensington Palace said Kate found out about the cancer after post-surgery tests were done.While it’s rare to find cancer after surgery for a noncancerous problem, it does happen in about 4% of such surgeries, said Dr. Yuman Fong, a surgeon at City of Hope cancer center in Southern California.“That 4% figure represents someone who’s going to the operating room for what is thought to be benign disease” such as a procedure to remove the gallbladder or ovarian cysts, Fong said.Yes, cancer is rare in young adults. But in developed countries, among younger adults. Kate is 42.“We hate it when young people get cancer, but at the same time, they are the ones that recover best,” Fong said.The palace statement said no details would be provided about her cancer or her treatment, other than she started it in late February.“We will not be sharing any further private medical information. The Princess has a right to medical privacy as we all do,” the statement said.After successful surgery, chemotherapy is often used to help kill any stray cancer cells and to prevent the cancer from coming back. Treatments have evolved, and when chemo is used now, it’s sometimes for shorter periods or lower doses than it once was.Fatigue, nausea, tingling in the hands and feet, and sometimes hair loss are side effects of chemotherapy, said Dr. Monica Avila of Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. But there are medications for improving these side effects. And cold caps that cool the scalp can prevent hair loss, Avila said.“A patient can take anywhere from a few weeks to a month or two to recover from those effects,” Avila said. Numbness and tingling can take longer to disappear, she said.The palace statement said that will be up to her doctors. “The princess is now on a recovery pathway,” the statement said.___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/21/intermittent-fasting-may-cause-cardiovascular-risk-study-says/,"Intermittent fasting may cause cardiovascular risk, study says","Does intermittent fasting for 8 hours really work?An abstract published by the American Heart Association on Monday, March 18, showed that over 20,000 adults who followed an 8-hour time-restricted eating schedule—a type of intermittent fasting—had a 91 percent higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease.“Overall, this study suggests that time-restricted eating may have short-term benefits but long-term adverse effects. When the study is presented in its entirety, it will be interesting and helpful to learn more of the details of the analysis,” said Christopher D. Gardner, Ph.D., FAHA, the Rehnborg Farquhar Professor of Medicine at Stanford University in Stanford, California, and chair of the writing committee for the Association’s 2023 scientific statement, Popular Dietary Patterns: Alignment with American Heart Association 2021 Dietary Guidance.The study also stated that people with heart disease or cancer also had an increased risk of cardiovascular death.Compared with a standard schedule of eating across 12-16 hours per day, limiting food intake to less than 8 hours per day was not associated with living longer, it added.Likewise, people with cardiovascular disease who follows restricted eating schedule additionally had a 66 percent higher risk of death from heart attack or stroke.“One of those details involves the nutrient quality of the diets typical of the different subsets of participants. Without this information, it cannot be determined if nutrient density might be an alternate explanation to the findings that currently focus on the window of time for eating. Second, it needs to be emphasized that categorization into the different windows of time-restricted eating was determined on the basis of just two days of dietary intake,” Gardner said.Senior study author Victor Wenze Zhong, Ph.D., a professor and chair of the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in Shanghai, Chinap, said that restricting daily eating time to a short period, such as 8 hours per day, has gained popularity in recent years as a way to lose weight and improve heart health.“However, the long-term health effects of time-restricted eating, including risk of death from any cause or cardiovascular disease, are unknown,” he said.In this study, researchers investigated the potential long-term health impact of following an 8-hour time-restricted eating plan.They reviewed information about dietary patterns for participants in the annual 2003-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) in comparison to data about people who died in the US from 2003 through December 2019, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Death Index database.Future research may examine the biological mechanisms that underlie the associations between a time-restricted eating schedule and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and whether these findings are similar for people who live in other parts of the world, the authors noted.Image credits: Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/21/experts-say-shunning-shingles-can-put-ones-health-life-at-risk/,"Experts say shunning shingles can put one’s health, life at risk","SEVERAL years ago, the host of a popular late-night show in the US said he had shingles once and immediately, the female guest somewhat referred to shingles as a form of STD or sexually transmitted disease.Of course, the host vehemently denied that shingles is an STD.CONTRARY to the late-night show guest’s belief, shingles is definitely not a disease caused by unsafe copulation. Also known as “Herpes Zoster,” shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that can cause chickenpox. Health experts said that those who have had chickenpox before are those who may contract shingles since the virus lies dormant in the nerve tissue and may resurrect several years later. It is also a painful and debilitating viral infection that when overlooked, may result in serious complications, and may put to risk the health of many who suffer from it, if unattended properly.Infectious disease specialist Dr. Rontgene Solante said that once the virus infects the body, it does not go away and will stay there and reactivate once the person reaches a particular age group or when the body’s immune system weakens. “You might ask where does the virus hide in the body. Well, it’s really an intelligent virus because it hides in the body’s central nervous system,” Dr. Solante commented in his presentation during the launch of the “Sabi Nila: The Truth About Shingles” nationwide awareness campaign organized by global biopharma company GSK and several health experts.He cited global data which showed the incidence of zoster increases with age. Although those aged 30 or 40 years may be vulnerable to shingles, once one reaches the age of 50, the risk increases exponentially. “If you are aged 50, 60, or 70 and 80 years old, you are also prone to the complications of zoster, which is PHN or Postherpetic Neuralgia that can extend for a longer period of time.”Dr. Solante said that before, they thought that age may be a triggering factor to reactivate zoster or shingles, but there are also other conditions, especially for those aged below 50 years old. These include chronic respiratory condition, or those with asthma, smokers, COPD or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, those infected by Covid-19 due to decreased immune response, HIV-AIDS, auto-immune disease like rheumatoid arthritis, steroids use, those with chronic renal disease.“These are the underlying conditions where people don’t need to be 50 years old and above to have shingles,” Solante averred.THERE are several stages, Dr. Solante said, before the symptoms of shingles are felt. There is the “prodromal” stage, which is before the appearance of the shingles rash. This is where the patient suffers from headache, sluggishness, and to some, loss of appetite, and then an abnormal sensation on the site of the rash.After that is the acute phase, which he said will last two to four weeks, and this is the time that patients will think it’s shingles because of the presence of a vesicular rash, which appears on only one side of the body. “It can’t appear on two sides of the body because it involves a specific area of the body’s nerve, and then associated with severe pain. Once the rash appears, the level of pain intensifies where patients will even find it difficult to dress up or do household chores,” Dr. Solante explained.Then after one month, there comes subacute herpetic neuralgia (SHN), which comes with a tingling sensation at the rash area, which can be so disturbing that the patient cannot sleep or move with ease or can even lead to depression.“The pain can really affect the normal living function of a patient, and the shingles complication can extend beyond three months or what we call PHN, featured with indescribable pain, with no treatment since the pain can be abated temporarily, which can last, for some, even for years,” Dr. Solante emphasized.Patients are also advised to refrain from touching or worse, scratching the surface of the rash for it might cause some deformities or scar in the skin, and shingles is really beyond the appearance of rash. “When we have patients with shingles, we just don’t talk about the rash but also the complications, and some patients need to be hospitalized because of those complications.”There is also the Herpes-Zoster Ophthalmicus which affects the nerve endings of the eyes, which may appear as lesions around the eye. But the danger there, Dr. Solante noted, is that it can also cause blindness in some patients and is quite difficult to treat. Other complications of zoster are inflammation of the brain or encephalitis, the Ramsay Hunt Syndrome or the paralysis of half of the face, which can cause distortion in hearing, and happens mostly on the elderly, Bell’s Palsy or weakness of one side of the face, or even cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events.“There is now a direct correlation between shingles and stroke because the virus can also penetrate the blood vessel where it will transfuse the brain. One may not be hypertensive; it’s really about the virus causing the stroke that is common now in the above-50-year-old bracket,” Dr. Solante said.Shingles have many other effects that may not be really visible to others like lack of sleep, no enjoyment of life because of limited mobility caused by pain, scars in the face that may cause embarrassment, performance of daily general activities, mood, working conditions, social relationship. “These are beyond the rash, beyond what we know about shingles. We need to know things that can help bring back life,” Solante averred.THE many truths about shingles that the public does not know of is what made GSK mount the “Sabi Nila: The Truth About Shingles” nationwide awareness campaign, with the hope of educating the public about the risks, impact and prevention of shingles, which Solante earlier described as a debilitating viral infection.The campaign also seeks to show how shingles impacts quality of life and the importance of consulting with a doctor, set right many common misconceptions about the disease and provide reliable information coming directly from healthcare professionals and even those who have, at one point in their lives, suffered from it, like Karen Davila, an award-winning broadcast journalist and shingles sufferer who was present during the launch. She shared her story to stress the importance of awareness about shingles. “I have had it twice. I felt depressed, scared, and honestly ashamed. I would not want anybody to experience that.”Bottomline, the panelists in the launch emphasized the value of consulting with a doctor first about how to prevent shingles, and that the campaign will surely help provide the public with enough knowledge through educational materials from health experts that will dispel myths and provide accurate and reliable information about shingles so that every Filipino can make informed decisions about their health."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/21/capitol-medical-center-is-now-a-contracted-philhealth-facility-for-kidney-transplants/,Capitol Medical Center is now a contracted PhilHealth facility for kidney transplants,"Capitol Medical Center, Inc. (CMCI) proudly emphasized the equity and accessibility of healthcare in the Philippines as it recently became the 10th Z Benefit Package contracted facility of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation or PhilHealth and 25th nationwide for Kidney Transplantation.The Z Benefit Package for Kidney Transplantation is structured to offer financial support to qualified members undergoing kidney transplant procedures. This initiative is geared towards enhancing accessibility and affordability for PhilHealth members seeking critical and costly medical interventions.Since the 1970’s CMCI has been one of the leading hospitals in the Philippines to perform kidney transplantations. This significant milestone for the institution aligns with its rich heritage of being one of the first to perform successful living donor kidney transplants in the country as shared by Dr. Angel Joaquin M. Amante, head of CMCI Organ Transplant Center.In 2003, CMCI was the first transplant center to perform Laparoscopic Nephrectomy. The institution established an integrated program for Organ Donation, marking the first stand-alone organ procurement in the country in 2006.Currently, the institution is armed with two comprehensive PhilHealth packages to support patients with renal disease. The hemodialysis treatment which consists of 156 dialysis sessions per year, and the Z Benefit Package where patients can be provided with the best care and world-class kidney transplantation procedure at a reasonable cost.The tireless efforts of the esteemed doctors and nurses achieved this partnership. With hard work and dedication, CMCI undoubtedly stands tall as the beacon of a high-quality healthcare facility, true to their call of providing “Right care, Right Here.”“This initiative reflects our unwavering commitment to make life-saving treatments more accessible and affordable to those in need of treatment.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/21/ai-powered-x-ray-system-sets-new-benchmark-in-medical-imaging/,AI-Powered X-ray system sets new benchmark in medical imaging,"An information technology company has unveiled a new benchmark in medical diagnostics with the introduction of an Artificial Intelligence or AI driven X-ray system capable of detecting over 30 pathologies in just a minute.According to Advanced Abilities, an all-Filipino technology company and an independent solutions aggregator, the AI Smart Scan represents a significant leap forward in medical technology. This portable, AI-driven X-ray system boasts a speedy detection system capable of delivering up to 200 scans in just eight hours. When asked about how this portable system works and how it determines the verification process, DeepTek Co-founder Ajit Patil told BusinessMirror that it operates as an online system, sending the scan to the cloud, where the cloud server processes it, taking two to three minutes.DeepTek is the software behind AI Smart Scan, called Augmento PACS, a medical imaging AI company based in India.The other system is the edge system, which sits next to the X-ray machine and directly processes the scan, called the Genki system. Angelo Antonio “AA” Buendia, CEO and President of Advanced Abilities, mentioned that the advantage of the Genki system is that it works without the internet. So, if you’re conducting remote screenings on an island without internet access, the scans can be processed immediately for the patient.Having a cloud system though will automatically centralize the data as you go, eliminating the need to worry about data management. The technology company asserts that its AI Smart Scan is capable of distinguishing between normal and abnormal cases by streamlining the detection process and generating reports based on initial radiologist assessments. Additionally, it boasts a user-friendly interface and a conscientious AI system that continuously evaluates its performance to ensure alignment with human radiologist interpretations.Furthermore, according to Buendia, the company is diligently working on an update that will expand its detection capabilities to include telephonics, Alzheimer’s, and cardiac risk assessments.FURTHERMORE, the technology company also unveiled Absol, a cutting-edge testing immunodiagnosis solution. Absol functions as a portable point-of-care rapid test kit that conducts blood tests for a range of conditions including cardiac, thyroid, metabolic, and inflammatory disorders. Additionally, they introduced RevDX, a portable device designed for complete blood count testing which delivers rapid results with just a single prick. Both Absol and RevDX boast the promise of accurate results within a remarkably short timeframe of five to 30 minutes.Buendia expressed excitement about the impact of these advancements, stating that “the results are empowering.”MEANWHILE, President of the Philippine Medical Association Dr. Maria Minerva Calimag emphasized the significant role of AI in enhancing the accuracy of medical diagnostics. According to Calimag, AI technology can greatly improve the detection process, particularly in screening procedures. With a high sensitivity rate exceeding 90 percent, AI-enabled tools result in efficient screening, allowing medical professionals to swiftly identify potential health issues. Following the screening phase, confirmatory tests are conducted promptly. While favorable test results alleviate concerns, any detected problems necessitate further confirmation and subsequent medical intervention. “That with the radiologist plus the AI, you have a higher sensitivity and specificity,” Dr. Calimag said. She emphasized that such technology improves the number of detected and confirmed cases, leading to better outcomes. From the perspective of medical practitioners like Dr. Calimag, AI emerges as a pivotal tool in improving diagnostic accuracy. She highlighted AI’s capacity to evolve through continuous learning from extensive data sets, refining its ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases. As the AI system accumulates more information, its proficiency increases, emphasizing the essential nature of ongoing learning and advancement in AI-driven diagnostic technology.“Good patient outcomes, better diagnosis, faster and more efficient healthcare,” Dr. Calimag said. While Buendia expressed that these technologies are not intended to replace human efforts, but rather to assist them, “it’s a tool that makes our productivity outputs more efficient.”“Our goal here is to be able to come up, partner up, deliver products or solutions like this, democratize it, make it accessible, and reach as many Filipinos as possible,” Buendia concluded."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/21/new-ai-tools-can-record-your-medical-consult-draft-a-message-from-your-doctor/,"New AI tools can record your medical consult, draft a message from your doctor","Don’t be surprised if your doctors start writing you overly friendly messages. They could be getting some help from artificial intelligence.New AI tools are helping doctors communicate with their patients, some by answering messages and others by taking notes during exams. It’s been 15 months since OpenAI released ChatGPT. Already thousands of doctors are using similar products based on large language models. One company says its tool works in 14 languages.AI saves doctors time and prevents burnout, enthusiasts say. It also shakes up the doctor-patient relationship, raising questions of trust, transparency, privacy and the future of human connection.Here’s a look at how new AI tools affect patients:In recent years, medical devices with machine learning have been doing things like reading mammograms, diagnosing eye disease and detecting heart problems. What’s new is generative AI’s ability to respond to complex instructions by predicting language.Your next check-up could be recorded by an AI-powered smartphone app that listens, documents and instantly organizes everything into a note you can read later. The tool also can mean more money for the doctor’s employer because it won’t forget details that legitimately could be billed to insurance.Your doctor should ask for your consent before using the tool. You might also see some new wording in the forms you sign at the doctor’s office.Other AI tools could be helping your doctor draft a message, but you might never know it.“Your physician might tell you that they’re using it, or they might not tell you,” said Cait DesRoches, director of OpenNotes, a Boston-based group working for transparent communication between doctors and patients. Some health systems encourage disclosure, and some don’t.Doctors or nurses must approve the AI-generated messages before sending them. In one Colorado health system, such messages contain a sentence disclosing they were automatically generated. But doctors can delete that line.“It sounded exactly like him. It was remarkable,” said patient Tom Detner, 70, of Denver, who recently received an AI-generated message that began: “Hello, Tom, I’m glad to hear that your neck pain is improving. It’s important to listen to your body.” The message ended with “Take care” and a disclosure that it had been automatically generated and edited by his doctor.Detner said he was glad for the transparency. “Full disclosure is very important,” he said.Large language models can misinterpret input or even fabricate inaccurate responses, an effect called hallucination. The new tools have internal guardrails to try to prevent inaccuracies from reaching patients—or landing in electronic health records.“You don’t want those fake things entering the clinical notes,” said Dr. Alistair Erskine, who leads digital innovations for Georgia-based Emory Healthcare, where hundreds of doctors are using a product from Abridge to document patient visits.The tool runs the doctor-patient conversation across several large language models and eliminates weird ideas, Erskine said. “It’s a way of engineering out hallucinations.”Ultimately, “the doctor is the most important guardrail,” said Abridge CEO Dr. Shiv Rao.As doctors review AI-generated notes, they can click on any word and listen to the specific segment of the patient’s visit to check accuracy.In Buffalo, New York, a different AI tool misheard Dr. Lauren Bruckner when she told a teenage cancer patient it was a good thing she didn’t have an allergy to sulfa drugs. The AI-generated note said, “Allergies: Sulfa.”The tool “totally misunderstood the conversation,” said Bruckner, chief medical information officer at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. “That doesn’t happen often, but clearly that’s a problem.”AI tools can be prompted to be friendly, empathetic and informative.But they can get carried away. In Colorado, a patient with a runny nose was alarmed to learn from an AI-generated message that the problem could be a brain fluid leak. (It wasn’t.) A nurse hadn’t proofread carefully and mistakenly sent the message.“At times, it’s an astounding help and at times it’s of no help at all,” said Dr. C.T. Lin, who leads technology innovations at Colorado-based UC Health, where about 250 doctors and staff use a Microsoft AI tool to write the first draft of messages to patients. The messages are delivered through Epic’s patient portal.The tool had to be taught about a new RSV vaccine because it was drafting messages saying there was no such thing. But with routine advice—like rest, ice, compression and elevation for an ankle sprain—“it’s beautiful for that,” Linn said.Also on the plus side, doctors using AI are no longer tied to their computers during medical appointments. They can make eye contact with their patients because the AI tool records the exam.The tool needs audible words, so doctors are learning to explain things aloud, said Dr. Robert Bart, chief medical information officer at Pittsburgh-based UPMC. A doctor might say: “I am currently examining the right elbow. It is quite swollen. It feels like there’s fluid in the right elbow.”Talking through the exam for the benefit of the AI tool can also help patients understand what’s going on, Bart said. “I’ve been in an examination where you hear the hemming and hawing while the physician is doing it. And I’m always wondering, ‘Well, what does that mean?’”U.S. law requires health care systems to get assurances from business associates that they will safeguard protected health information, and the companies could face investigation and fines from the Department of Health and Human Services if they mess up.Doctors interviewed for this article said they feel confident in the data security of the new products and that the information will not be sold.Information shared with the new tools is used to improve them, so that could add to the risk of a health care data breach.Dr. Lance Owens is chief medical information officer at the University of Michigan Health-West, where 265 doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners are using a Microsoft tool to document patient exams. He believes patient data is being protected.“When they tell us that our data is safe and secure and segregated, we believe that,” Owens said."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/21/family-development-sessions-offer-crucial-support-to-stop-tb/,Family Development Sessions Offer Crucial Support to Stop TB,"The Betser family from Zamboanga Sibugay shares a story common to many. Faced with tuberculosis (TB) infecting three family members—son Lloyd Vincent, husband Bernard, and daughter Leah—their limited income initially led them to seek alternative treatments like faith healing and self-medication.Arlyn, Bernard’s wife who earns P4,000 as a household helper, felt immense pressure during that challenging time.The family is one of the partner-beneficiaries of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) in Region 9. Through the Family Development Sessions (FDS), one of the key components in the implementation of the 4Ps, they learned the importance of knowing the symptoms, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of TB. More importantly, they realized the value of seeking prof essional help and that self-medication could make things worse.After her family recovered, Arlyn requested for a special FDS to be conducted among her co-4Ps beneficiaries in their area. Arlyn shared her story so others like her would learn.“Napakalaking tulong ang FDS sa amin dahil nalaman ko kung paano magamot ang TB, paano maiiwasan, at ano ang gagawin para hindi makahawa sa iba (FDS is a big help because we learned how to cure TB, how to prevent it, and how to curb its spread),” said Arlyn.THE Betser family was one of the families gathered to share personal stories of battling TB during an event organized by the Department of Health (DOH), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)’s TB Innovations and Health Systems Strengthening Project (TB IHSS) implemented by FHI 360. FHI360 is an international nonprofit organization working to improve the health and well-being of people in the United States and around the world.Representatives from the DSWD and USAID also attended the event dubbed “Empowering Families Against Tuberculosis: Success Stories and Insights from the Implementation of Family Development Session on TB Awareness” which was held at the Luxent Hotel in Quezon City last March 14, 2024.Tuberculosis remains a global concern, according to Health Secretary Teodoro J. Herbosa.“TB is a public health emergency and needs concerted action from all stakeholders. We’ve made notable progress in the fight against TB, including finding 2.1 million people with TB,” he said.FDS, a continuing education program conducted nationwide, is regarded as an important intervention to fulfill the family development thrust of the 4Ps. It intends to strengthen the capacities of 4Ps families, particularly the parents/grantees, to become more responsive to the health and education needs of the family and their children, to become more socially aware, and to be involved and participative in community development activities.Another success story is that of the Arimado family. When Lhian Arimado started to experience weight loss, frequent chills, and occasional vomiting, her mother Cecilia, a market vendor, knew something was wrong. During her pre-graduation photoshoot, Lhian suddenly felt weak and unable to stand. Cecilia took her to a clinic in Legazpi, Albay where she was later referred to a health center for further evaluation. There, Lhian was diagnosed with TB. However, it was only through FDS that Lhian was able to start taking her medications.“Ang FDS ang nagbigay daan para sa paggaling ng aking anak (FDS was the key towards the healing of my daughter),” Cecilia said. “Pinagkalooban nila ang aming anak ng mga gamot at bitamina at tinuruan kung paano maalagaan ang aming sarili at ang mga kamag-anak na may tuberculosis. (They gave her medicines and vitamins, and they taught us how to better care for ourselves and for others).”Marites M. Maristela, DSWD Assistant Secretary for National Household Targeting Office and 4Ps, said that it was in 2016 when the DOH conducted the National TB Prevalence Survey. Based on the survey, a beneficiary of the 4Ps is 1.6 times more likely to get sick of TB than a non-beneficiary.TO address the higher TB rates among beneficiaries, DSWD pilot-tested an FDS guide on TB awareness in San Juan City, Bataan, and Cavite also in 2016. In 2019, DSWD started to work with USAID’s TB Innovations and Health Systems Strengthening to roll out the FDS on TB Awareness. Revisions based on the session guide were delayed by Covid-19 but completed in 2022 with USAID support.Maristela explained that during an FDS on TB awareness, attendees who themselves may be experiencing TB symptoms or who have a family member experiencing them are referred to local government or barangay health units for further assessment and treatment.“FDS sessions have emerged as a valuable strategy for raising TB awareness within family units, fostering behavioral changes, reducing stigma, promoting community engagement, and ensuring long-term impact in the fight against TB,” said Vilma Cabrera, DSWD Undersecretary for National Household Targeting System (NHTO) and 4Ps.Cabrera explained that the campaign’s success hinged on several key approaches which include community engagement, family-centered interventions, health education and awareness, behavior change communication, multi-sectoral collaboration, and empowerment and capacity building.HOWEVER, Cabrera acknowledged that implementing these sessions was not without hurdles. Despite challenges like limited access to remote areas, stigma, resource constraints, and healthcare system vulnerabilities, the agency was able to overcome these and achieve its goal of empowering communities against TB. Their success stemmed from a multi-pronged approach: deploying mobile clinics, training community health workers, establishing support groups, and forging strong partnerships.Looking forward, Cabrera further noted the campaign’s long-term potential through sustained community engagement and ongoing family support. Key measures for future success include long-term sustainability, training and capacity building, technology integration, use of digital platforms, community engagement, and continued partnerships and collaboration.“By implementing these measures, we can ensure sustained community engagement and ongoing support for families beyond the immediate campaign period, maximizing our long-term impact on TB control and prevention,” she concluded.For more information about TB, healthylungs.ph.

Although curable, the Department of Health (DOH) said that TB remains one of the 10 leading causes of death in the Philippines.According to the World Health Organization, the Philippines currently has the highest TB incidence rate in Asia.To address the global tuberculosis (TB) crisis and target actions, resource mobilization, and advocacy efforts to effectively combat TB on a global, regional, and national scale, the DOH, in collaboration with the Stop TB Partnership, and USAID, hosted a Regional High-Level Meeting from March 14 and 15, 2024.Outlined in the United Nations High-Level Meeting (UN HLM) Political Declaration on TB, the active planning of advocacy efforts, with a focus on raising awareness among political leadership and high-level stakeholders regarding the burden of TB and the urgent need for a comprehensive response were on the meeting agenda.RECOGNIZING the financial challenges in tackling TB, the collaboration strategized on increasing funding from domestic budgets, external financing partners, and innovative financing mechanisms.This includes exploring sustainable ways to secure the necessary resources for TB prevention and care.“We live in historical times. Today, in Manila we kicked off the first of six meetings we will host around the world highlighting regional cooperation on TB efforts in countries,” said Stop TB Partnership Executive Director, Dr. Lucica Ditiu.Dr. Ditiu said that the Philippines and Indonesia are a true inspiration for other countries in the region as well as globally for their high-level political commitment and for the great achievements in the TB response, with “a record number of people with TB having access to diagnosis, treatment, and care in 2022 and 2023, including new tools and international recommendations.”“We see an incredible ambition from countries, and we see it is feasible to end TB but, unfortunately, our biggest challenge of continuous low levels of funding remains. We must not get discouraged by it. We must not accept the current status quo and we must speak up and remain united more than ever and believe in ourselves. Because yes, We Can End TB!,” added Dr. Ditiu.“THE global tuberculosis crisis demands urgent and concerted action. In our pursuit to combat TB on a global scale, we are committed to active advocacy, resource mobilization, and strategic planning. The DOH, together with the Stop TB Partnership, the World Health Organization, the Global Fund, USAID, and TB communities and patient support groups, is resolute in raising awareness among political leaders and stakeholders about the urgency of addressing the TB burden,” Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said.Herbosa said that they acknowledge the resource constraints and, “together, we will explore innovative financing mechanisms to ensure sustainable resources for TB prevention and care.”Distinguished participants during the event, aside from Herbosa and Dr. Ditiu, include Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia, H.E.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/21/filipinos-urged-to-be-kidney-donors/,Filipinos urged to be kidney donors,"A group of kidney transplant donors and recipients urged Filipinos last week to donate kidneys, saying thousands of patients need them to have a second chance in life.Kidney Transplant Association of the Philippines (KTAP) assistant auditor Liberty Calla said around 3,000 individuals who have kidney failure need transplantation.“We advocate kidney transplantation kasi sa kidney transplantation po doon nagkakaroon ng (because with kidney transplantation there is) quality of life,” she said in a Bagong Pilipinas Ngayon interview aired over PTV-4.Calla said she received kidney from a deceased donor.KTAP Liturgy Community chair Abraham Mirandilla received a kidney from a living non-related donor.“At least 18 years old and above, pwede po mag-donate. Usually, ang kina-campaign talaga ay related, pero dahil sa kulang, minsan hindi naman talaga nagma-match eh, so meron din pong non-related (can donate, usually related [donors to patients] are campaigned, but there is shortage of donors, sometimes kidneys do not match, so there is also non-related),” he said.In February, National Kidney and Transplant Institute (NKTI)-Human Organ Preservation Effort (HOPE) chief transplant coordinator Peter Paul Plegaria said the NKTI said dialysis patients nationwide are at around two million but there are only 260 individuals on the waiting list for organ donation.Plegaria said HOPE visits trauma hospitals in the National Capital Region, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Region 4-A (Calabarzon) and Southern Luzon to look for potential donors of kidneys and other viable organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, corneas, and bones.“Sa HOPE po namimigay kami ng organ donor card sa mga binibisita naming schools, opisina at saka sa driver’s license po natin, nandoon po ‘yung for donation, may che-check (At HOPE, we distribute organ donor card to schools, offices we visit, and in our driver’s license, for donation is mentioned, you just have to check) if you want to donate,” Calla said.Apart from organ donation, the KTAP also advocates for kidney disease awareness and prevention since 1986.

It is designed as pocket-friendly for as low as P298 annually and uncomplicated to claim.Once availed, policyholders will get exclusive e-gift vouchers worth P100 via Giftaway and can be claimed 20 days after purchasing the policy. Customers may avail themselves of multiple policies with critical illness coverage of up to a maximum of P2 million.BANKING on their partnership, FWD Philippines seeks to foster a sense of trust and reliability among Filipino digital natives who primarily use GCash for their financial needs and provide accessible protection against these most dreaded diseases.“We’re optimistic that this seamless and innovative partnership with GCash can inspire and drive more young Filipinos to become protected,” noted FWD Philippines Chief Partnership Officer Irene Andas.“We hope that by making this plan available via GCash, we can bridge the protection gap and make it easier for them to become prepared for such challenges,” Vandenberghe added.On their part, GCash Vice President and Group Head of New Businesses Winsley Bangit expressed high hopes for their team up.“We share FWD’s commitment to help more Filipinos, especially when it comes to health and financial protection. With just a few taps, one can now get year-long protection against these top three illnesses,” he said."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/21/muscle-strength-can-be-maintained-by-eating-healthy-exercising-regularly/,"Muscle strength can be maintained by eating healthy, exercising regularly","THE muscles in our bodies are generally soft tissues and are essential tools to keep the body moving, whether you’re doing regular exercises at the gym or running full marathons. Aside from physical activities, muscles are vital in moving and supporting various organs like the heart, for example, which is perhaps the hardest-working muscle that beats constantly so that humans survive.The body’s muscles are a complex setup made up of more than 600 ones, mainly made of thousands of small woven fibers. These fibers are stretched and pressed together to move the organs or the body so that it will function, while providing the strength and energy to support movement, stability, digestion, circulation, and many other bodily functions.According to the Cleveland Clinic, a nonprofit multispecialty academic medical center that integrates clinical and hospital care with research and education, the muscles that move the body have two types of movements, voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary actions are movements that humans can control, where it can perform an action and the muscles move the body to make that action happen. Involuntary movements, on the other hand, are those that happen automatically without even thinking about them. The clinic says the beating heart and the muscles in the chest and back that move the ribs when breathing are examples of involuntary movements.Using a combination of voluntary and involuntary movements, muscles help the body in terms of vision, hearing, breathing, speaking and swallowing, food digestion and eliminating body waste, movement, pumping blood through the heart and blood vessels, even giving birth, and stores and releases energy that the body uses as part of metabolism, the clinic pointed out.HOWEVER, just like any complex machinery, the body’s muscles also experience wear and tear due to constant use. Over a period of years, the muscle mass and strength may dissipate gradually, sometimes starting at the age of 30 years. However, this loss may also be because of a serious condition called sarcopenia, which is more common due to age.According to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) sarcopenia is the “age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass plus loss of muscle strength and/or reduced physical performance without reference to comorbidity.” Since October 1, 2016, the International Classification of Disease defines sarcopenia as a “disease, a major clinical problem that mostly affects older people with adverse outcomes, including poor quality of life, increases in falls, fractures, disabilities, institutionalization, and increased mortality risks.”Studies have also shown that there are many different factors that may cause sarcopenia, such as age-related changes, lifestyle factors, and chronic diseases.According to Dr. Jose Dimaano, Jr., Medical Director for Abbott’s nutrition business in Asia Pacific, muscles are the largest component of the total body lean mass, which is everything that makes up the body except for fat. “In fact, muscles usually account for 50 to 60 percent of our body weight. This is why healthy muscles are essential to a person’s physical strength, organ function, skin integrity, immunity and wound healing.”DR. Dimaano pointed out that muscle health matters, more importantly for older adults who are vulnerable to involuntary age-related muscle decay. Starting around the age of 40, he said adults can lose up to eight percent of their muscle mass per decade, and this rate of loss almost doubles after the age of 70.“As we age, muscle fibers shrink. Muscle tissues are also replaced more slowly, and often by tough, fibrous or fatty tissues that are rigid. And if you don’t meet your nutritional and exercise needs, your muscles will be less efficient in their ability to contract, leading to diminished strength and function,” said Dr. Dimaano.Speaking of sarcopenia, Dr. Dimaano said it may affect nearly one in three people over the age of 50. Sarcopenia can significantly impact a person’s quality of life and drive health complications. He said drastic muscle decay can impede one’s ability to do simple tasks such as walking, climbing a flight of stairs or even standing up from a chair. The condition can also increase incidences of falls and fractures that can cause disability, hospitalization and loss of independence.“Malnutrition is one of the many factors that can quicken muscle mass loss among older adults,” Dr. Dimaano added. “What’s tricky is that malnutrition is actually common but often goes undetected because it can be asymptomatic or dismissed as part of the aging process.”To prove his point, Dr. Dimaano stressed the value of early detection and intervention to address nutritional gaps to prevent sarcopenia, adding that healthy eating and properly exercising daily are both critical elements in preventing and treating sarcopenia.He said that by choosing a balanced diet full of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats and key vitamins and minerals, like calcium and vitamin D, these can help protect muscle mass, while older adults should also look to protein and HMB (β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate), a small molecule found in the body after the amino and the leucine is metabolized. Protein, he said, found in protein-rich food types such as meat, fish, beans, soy and nuts, forms, builds and repairs the physical structure of every part of the body.“We often don’t get the right amount of nutrients our body needs from our meals alone,” Dr. Dimaano pointed out. “That’s why Abbott develops science-based nutrition for people of all ages, including oral nutrition supplements with HMB to help Filipino adults stay strong and active.”“What we want people to understand is that while aging is natural, age-related muscle decay doesn’t have to be inevitable. Eating healthier, engaging in physical activity and using HMB nutritional supplementation are the right steps toward preserving muscle strength,” he concluded."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/21/training-future-healthcare-leaders-asian-hospital-holds-its-8th-commencement-exercises-launches-heartthrobs/,"Training Future Healthcare Leaders: Asian Hospital holds its 8th commencement exercises, launches heartthrobs","Premier healthcare institution Asian Hospital and Medical Center is preparing for the future of healthcare in the country with the recent conduct of the 8th Residents’ and Fellows’ commencement exercises and the launch of “Heartthrobs.”A total of 21 physician graduates from Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Adult Critical Care Medicine, Advanced Minimally Invasive Surgery and Breast Surgery participated in the 8th Residents’ and Fellows’ commencement exercises together with their parents at The Palms Country Club last March 14, 2024.The commencement speaker was Muntinlupa Mayor Rozzano Rufino “Ruffy” B. Biazon who lauded the graduates for their “dedicated years of hard work, sacrifice, and unwavering commitment to the noble pursuit of healing and caring for others.”“While your residency at Asian Hospital may be coming to an end, your journey as medical professionals is only just beginning. The road ahead may be challenging, filled with obstacles and uncertainties but I have no doubt that each and every one of you possesses the resilience, determination and compassion needed to overcome any obstacle that may come your way,” he said.Dr. Beaver Tamesis, Asian Hospital President and CEO, commended the graduates for their determination and dedication to achieve their goals, noting that they started their residency and fellowship “during the depths of the pandemic.”“The hospital did well during this time. You helped patients during this difficult time and we were lucky to have you. We are eternally grateful that all of you went through that period with us,” Dr. Tamesis said.Dr. Madeleine Grace Sosa, Chair of the Medical Training Program Committee, pointed out that it was in 2014 that the Asian Hospital management decided to the take the lead in the “formation of training programs as the launching point for the new generation of medical professionals, to teach and train graduates of medicine to continue the legacy of excellence in healthcare.”“Medicine is a stressful career field but the opportunity to pass on what you know to new doctors can be an extremely rewarding experience. In the near future, we look forward to more training programs in our hospital. As we reach the third decade of Asian Hospital, we will be prepared to see our trainees coming back to serve our community. We will continue to build an academic environment where culture of learning and teaching continue to predominate,” she said.Speaking on behalf of the graduates, Dr. Rachelle Anne Cruz said she and her fellow graduates did not expect to be in the midst of a pandemic but said the experience made them resilient, strong and adaptable.“I would like to believe that the past three years were a breeze, but it was not. Yet, through it all, we’ve persevered, come out stronger, wiser and more resilient. We are usually called the generation of millennial doctors but as I reflect, I believe that we are also a generation characterized by our deep sense of empathy and social consciousness,” she said.“We understand that healthcare is not just about treating disease but it’s also about caring for the whole person and addressing the social element of health that impact their well-being. We are a generation full of empathy and compassion for our patients and recognizing our ability to connect on a human level is just as important as our medical knowledge,” Dr. Cruz added.For his closing remarks, Dr. Jose Acuin, Asian Hospital’s Chief Medical Officer, shared a wise Japanese saying which said the reason to live consists of four things. The first thing is that you need to do something that you love doing. Secondly, you should be good at that something that you love doing.Third, that something should be something the world needs. Lastly, that something you are good at, that you love doing and what the world needs, is something you should get paid for.“It is important that you find your way and I hope that seeing your parents, seeing the joyful lives that they live, your significant other, will give you the inspiration as well to do the same,” Dr. Acuin said.To encourage the older population to have their heart health checked, Asian Hospital and Medical Center recently launched a campaign called YourHearthrobs@AsianHospital. The intended audience of this social media campaign is the younger generation who can convince their parents and grandparents to have their hearts checked.Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority indicated that in 2023, heart disease is the leading cause of death among Filipinos with ischemic heart disease topping the cause of death. This is followed by cancer and cerebrovascular diseases.“People nowadays rely heavily on social media to know more about certain diseases and the tests to get. However, the disadvantage is not all information on social media is correct so we, as experts in this field, want to help in bridging gaps and prevent misinformation,” stated Hennesy Lou Miranda, Director for Marketing and Patient Experience at Asian Hospital.To bridge this information gap, Asian Hospital will tap “Heartthrobs” or heart experts to seed heart health information on various social media platforms. They will also be tapped to give Wellness Talks at community and corporate events; convention speaking engagements as well as media engagements. The Corporate Affairs Team will provide the heartthrobs with the necessary media training.Three heartthrobs have so far been recruited for this task: Dr. Lauren Kay Evangelista, Dr. Jaime Alfonso Manalo Aherrera, and Dr. Michael Joseph Reyes. Dr. Evangelista’s advocacy is to improve heart failure care and outcomes in the Philippines through multiprofessional and collaborative care. An active consultant of Asian Hospital, she is one of the five heart failure specialists of the Philippine Core Member of the Council of Heart Failure in the Philippine Heart Association.Dr. Aherrera is an interventional cardiologist at Asian Hospital. He was recognized as the Most Outstanding Fellow in Training by the Philippine Hospital Association and was awarded as Outstanding Young Scientist by the National Academy of Science and Technology Philippines.Dr. Reyes got his interventional cardiology fellowship at the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital and is an active consultant of Asian Hospital. He is presently the Training Officer of the Asian Cardiovascular Institute Fellowship Program.“We are very optimistic that with the help of our three heartthrobs and the younger generation, parents and grandparents will realize the need to have their hearts checked on a regular basis,” Miranda said."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/14/a-healthy-work-environment-is-the-key-to-healthy-living/,A healthy work environment is the key to healthy living,"THE Philippines has its own Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Standards crafted back in 1978, and later amended in 1989. These standards were meant to “safeguard the worker’s social and economic well-being as well as his physical safety and health.”Almost three decades later, these standards were updated via Republic Act No. 11058 or “An Act Strengthening Compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Standards and Providing Penalties for Violations Thereof,” which was passed on August 17, 2018, and came with a corresponding Implementing Rules and Regulations that was published almost four months later through Department Order No. 198.These standards were not meant to be just a piece of paper but meant to be enforced widely in the country, where employers are mandated to adopt and use “appropriate practices, means, methods, operations or processes, and working conditions to ensure safe and healthful employment.”Studies have shown the critical connection between health and work, where healthy workers would have greater chances of employment than those who have health issues. While issues with physical health can affect work chances, an unhealthy work environment can also affect health and bring about problems such as stress, anxiety, depression, hypertension and other negative health issues. This, in turn, can also affect the company in terms of more employee absences due to sickness, lower worker productivity, among others. The link between health and work became more evident during Covid-19, which showed the importance of having effective systems in place to protect workers’ health and at the same time secure their job and their ability to earn.WHILE gainful employment provides Filipinos the financial security to provide for the family, their work can also be a contributory factor when it comes to occupational risks that can either positively or negatively affect their health and financial security.Dr. Jeffrey Pfeffer from Stanford University, who is also an expert on workplace health, said there are several factors that can directly impact the health of employees while working, one of which is job design, including control over work. He said organizations “can guard against these dangers by creating roles with more fluidity and autonomy, and by erecting barriers to micromanagement.”There is also the issue of overtime and number of hours worked. Many Filipinos often choose to work longer hours for that added boost to their monthly paycheck. However, according to Pfeffer, long work hours have been associated with adverse health effects, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, disability. “Employers need to acknowledge this fact and encourage workers to leave after their workday is done to enjoy time with family and friends, without the stigma often associated with ‘leaving early.’”For many Filipinos who value work and at the same time put a premium on family commitments, the conflict of choosing between work and family is oftentimes a constant struggle. These days, Pfeffer pointed out that “people need to choose their employer not just for salary and promotion opportunities, but on the basis of whether the job will be good for their psychological and physical health.” He advised employers to “ensure that your employees know that family and other personal commitments are a part of life, and give them the flexibility to not miss out on important moments with family. If employees are happy at home, they will bring their best selves to work every day.”He likewise recommended that organizations should stop worrying about healthcare costs and instead focus on their company’s work environment, which according to Pfeffer, is “a source of a lot of the stressors, which create chronic disease.”Offering health insurance is also a way to help improve overall work environment and create a place where workers can do great work while at the same time remain healthy. “Companies that build great workplaces also improve human physical and mental health and lifespan,” Pfeffer said.FOR PhilCare President and CEO Jaeger Tanco, he said the company understands the intrinsic link between health and professional longevity. This is why PhilCare, Tanco said, continues to come up with products and services that were designed specifically with that critical link in mind.Among these products, he said, include ActivNation, a series of corporate programs designed to help employers keep their workforce healthy, with customizable corporate plans to meet the specific needs of a business regardless of its size, plus prepaid healthcare plans to help workers, particularly those in the freelance economy so that they, too, can access quality medical and mental health services.Aside from that, PhilCare also appoints liaison officers in companies to make sure the utilization of its services is a shared responsibility between PhilCare and the business.Just recently, PhilCare came out with the results of its recent study, “The ABCs of Pinoy Xs and Ys,” which is the sixth in PhilCare’s groundbreaking series of nationwide health and wellness studies that began in 2014. This latest installment builds on the insights of the first generational study about Gen Zs that came out in late 2023 and puts the spotlight on Generation X, or those between ages 43 and 58, and Generation Y, also known as Millennials, or those between ages 27 and 42.“We recognize the challenges and aspirations of Generations X and Y by empowering them to navigate their careers with vitality and retire well by prioritizing their health,” Tanco explained. “We aim to be the steadfast partner of employers and workers in achieving holistic well-being.”"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/14/innovation-alliance-with-regulators-sought-to-uplift-local-beauty-industry/,"Innovation, alliance with regulators sought to uplift local beauty industry","THE Chamber of Cosmetics Industry of the Philippines (CCIP) is aiming for innovation and sustainable partnership with government regulators like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with the end goal of accelerating the beauty sector’s further development while maintaining the high-quality and safe standards for personal and skin care products in the domestic market.This was among the key topics discussed during the induction of the CCIP’s newly elected Board of Trustees held recently at the Discovery Suites Hotel in Ortigas City. FDA’s Center for Cosmetics and Household/Urban Hazardous Substances Regulation and Research Director Engr. Ana Trinidad Rivera facilitated the oath taking ceremonyThe commitment pledge, on the other hand, was led by FDA Director General (DG) Dr. Samuel Zacate. Others present in the event were FDA Attorney III Pamela Angeline Sevilla and FDA Office of the Director General Executive Assistant Daniella Nicole De Vera.The meeting, likewise, served as a courtesy call with Dr. Zacate, who joined in a dialogue about the cosmetics industry’s concerns on FDA regulations. He underscored how crucial innovation is for the local cosmetics sector and expressed his desire to empower industry players by making regulations more enabling while still compliant to the principles of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).The Philippine policy environment for cosmetics is mainly based on the Asean Cosmetic Directive, an initiative that pushes trade among Asean member-states by harmonizing technical industry requirements while maintaining safety and quality standards.“It’s a challenge that the FDA wants to help tackle with the local cosmetics industry,” said Dr. Zacate.DR. Zacate is an advocate for the “F-Pop Initiative,” the agency’s project in partnership with the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) Korea.The campaign seeks to promote “functional cosmetics” so as to make the Philippine beauty industry more competitive in terms of product innovations as compared to neighboring countries, such as South Korea, China and Japan.Also, he delved on plans for digitalization to optimize FDA’s e-portal and, eventually, migrate cosmetics and food registrations for automatic posting.“It was a fruitful meeting. We see that the FDA recognizes the industry’s needs and painpoints,” noted CCIP President Christine Reyes.The chamber’s leader is expecting for more constructive talks and potential solutions with the FDA. She sees it as the beginning of a more sustainable alliance between the beauty industry and the FDA.Being a collective voice for the industry, CCIP champions favorable policies and regulations with government agencies like the FDA, thus, guaranteeing a more enabling environment for cosmetics businesses to operate and grow.Roderick L.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/14/whole-of-society-approach-pushed-at-cancer-summit-to-fight-cancer/,‘Whole of society’ approach pushed at cancer summit to fight cancer,"Convening stakeholders from diverse sectors, the 2024 Philippine National Cancer Summit (PNCS) championed a “whole of society” approach, emphasizing its potential to significantly improve cancer care in the Philippines.With the theme “Advancing Integrated Cancer Care Systems for the Filipino,” the summit was co-organized by the Philippine College of Surgeons Cancer Commission Foundation (PCS CanCom), the Cancer Coalition Philippines (CCPh), and the Philippine Cancer Society (PCS).The event fostered a collaborative environment by uniting a broad spectrum of stakeholders from the national and international cancer community, including medical professionals, patient advocates and survivors, academic and research institutions, industry partners, the private sector, local government representatives, and key national agencies.The summit aimed to achieve several key goals which include to identify and share best practices, models, and innovations in integrated cancer care; discuss the progress of the National Integrated Cancer Control Act (NICCA) implementation and localization efforts; establish concrete quality metrics in cancer care by introducing tools, frameworks, and defining standards for patient care, and formulate actionable recommendations to improve the quality and accessibility of cancer care throughout the Philippines, among others.Cancer remains a major public health challenge, contributing to 7.84 percent of the country’s disease burden and ranking as the third highest cause of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY). Breast cancer is the most common among women, accounting for 31.4 percent of cases, while lung cancer is the most prevalent and deadliest among men, with 19.5 percent of cases, based on recent statistics.In the face of these alarming numbers, the two-day summit offered new hope and direction, aligning with the goals of the NICCA. Enacted on February 14, 2019, the NICCA provides a comprehensive framework to ensure the availability of quality and affordable cancer care services, aiming to improve survival rates and alleviate the financial burden on patients and their families.DR. Manuel Francisco “Ramy” Roxas, chairperson of PCS CanCom which spearheaded the summit, highlighted the event’s importance in bringing together stakeholders from various sectors to improve cancer care.“During this summit, we are reminded of the importance of collaboration, innovation, and empowerment against cancer. We are here to listen to each other and inspire each other to continue to improve cancer care for our people,” he stated, emphasizing a “whole of society” approach to the cancer fight.Cancer care with a whole-of-society approach is a strategy that goes beyond the walls of hospitals and clinics. It underscores collaboration between various sectors of society to improve prevention, detection, treatment, and support for people with cancer.In his keynote address read by Philippine Cancer Center Head Dr. Alfonso Nuñez III, Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Teodoro “Ted” Herbosa pointed out the significant challenge cancer poses to public health and its expensive consequences. He stressed the need to educate and inform communities about health-maintaining behaviors and disease prevention.MEANWHILE, Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Benjamin “Benhur” Abalos Jr. said he aims to unite stakeholders to devise a unified plan for cancer care at the local government level.“We should really sit down, look at the capacity of each, harmonize everything, and do a master plan. That is what I commit to this group that we’re going to do,” said Abalos.Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte likewise shared the city’s efforts. “We are in the process of crafting the localized version of the NICCA. The city government can allocate a more significant amount of resources when we have the local version of the national law. Hopefully, this can be done by the second quarter of this year,” said Belmonte.The QC mayor also stated that their overall goal is to establish and maintain a system that combines scientific advancements and practical applications into a comprehensive program aimed at reducing cancer morbidity and mortality in the country, particularly in Quezon City.“Serving as frontline implementers of healthcare policies, all LGUs play an important role in integrating national guidelines with local needs through active collaborations with community stakeholders,” said Belmonte as she mentioned the DOH, Philippine Cancer Society, Cancer Warrior PH, PhilHealth, as among the stakeholders.ON the second day of the summit, Paolo Maximo F. Borromeo, CEO and President of Ayala Health and Presidential Adviser on Health, talked about the power of partnerships in improving cancer care in the country.“Since last year’s National Cancer Summit, I am proud to say that we have inaugurated and opened the Healthway Cancer Care Hospital [HCCH], the country’s first dedicated cancer specialty hospital. With a total investment of P3 billion, our goal is for this 100-bed facility to offer the best value hospital for cancer care,” said Borromeo.Located in Arca South in Taguig City, the 100-bed facility is equipped with 18 chemotherapy infusion units, four operating theaters, two Linear Accelerators (LINACs), and all the essential diagnostic and imaging machines, including PET-CT, optimized for cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment.“In the short time since its inception, the Healthway Cancer Care Hospital has achieved remarkable milestones in patient care and medical procedures,” said Borromeo, citing the hospital’s recent achievements, including the first colorectal and breast cancer surgeries, the first chemotherapy administration, the first histopathology case, and the first patients to complete radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine procedures within its state-of-the-art facility.HE emphasized that robust partnerships that embody collaboration and synergy across various sectors are the key to achieving this.“In healthcare, particularly in the context of cancer care, it’s crucial to acknowledge that no single entity can effectively tackle the complex challenges alone. Our partnership framework embodies the foundation of our approach—a commitment to forging strategic alliances with key stakeholders across various sectors to amplify our impact, empower patients, and drive positive change,” added Borromeo.He enumerated these collaborations: partners in both national and local governments, as well as financing, technical, pharmaceutical, healthcare institutes, corporate, and patient and advocacy groups.Day 2 of the summit also featured DOH Undersecretary Enrique A. Tayag who discussed the progress and gains in cancer care and NICCA implementation and Dr. Nuñez who tackled the PCC’s journey towards becoming the country’s apex cancer referral hospital.The 2024 Philippine National Cancer Summit, held on February 29 and March 1 at Novotel Araneta, served as a vital platform for stakeholders to collaborate and share innovations in cancer care, aiming to transform the landscape of cancer treatment and management in the Philippines.By emphasizing the crucial role of early screening and intervention for prevalent cancers, the summit sought to gather collective efforts toward a future where Filipinos no longer fear cancer. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure everyone has access to the necessary care and support to fight this disease."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/07/sleepasil-beyond-melatonin-a-new-era-of-sleep-and-stress-relief-begins/,Sleepasil: Beyond Melatonin—A new era of sleep and stress relief begins,"Sleepasil, one of leading food supplements for sleep and stress relief in the Philippines recently celebrated its 18th year in the market with a new look and broader visions.The brand, which has been trusted by millions of Filipinos since 2004, recently underwent a packaging redesign and a brand positioning relaunch. The new packaging features a streamlined and contemporary appearance that reflects the brand’s premium quality and innovation.“I saw its growth from the way it was before. Sleepasil has been the leading food supplement in the country and right now we’re on our way back there,” Sleepasil Associate Brand Manager Alex Bravo told BusinessMirror.The new brand positioning, on the other hand, highlights the unique benefits of Sleepasil beyond melatonin.“Sleepasil is more than just melatonin. It is also made of chamomile, valerian root, and lemon balm, which are natural ingredients that help you relax, feel less anxious, and get ready for the next day,” Bravo said.Bravo, who has been with the company for almost six years, said Sleepasil is designed to be more uplifting and motivational, striving to empower consumers to exceed their potential.“The more inspirational side of things is that hindi lang ito melatonin [this is not just melatonin], this is actually helping you be more than what you can be. Because when you have a good night’s sleep, you can do more, you can achieve more, you can live more,” he added.Meanwhile, one of the Sleepasil Category Managers Isa told BusinessMirror the company’s impressive 18-year tenure in the market, emphasized the trust earned from consumers that has sustained its longevity in the industry.She humorously referenced Sleepasil’s transformation as akin to receiving a visit from a “fairy godmother,” alluding to the magical rejuvenation of the brand.Isa shared the meticulous redesign process, which involved transitioning from the old packaging to the smooth and modern design now available in leading drug stores across the Philippines and various online e-commerce platforms.In addition to the aesthetic overhaul, she outlined the strategic motive behind the rebranding effort, “we also want to reposition or relaunch the brand positioning of Sleepasil.”“We really want to differentiate Sleepasil and we want it to stand out for what it is unique for,” she added.Through these initiatives, Sleepasil aims to not only revitalize its image but also reaffirm its commitment to providing consumers with a premium sleep aid solution that stands out in terms of quality, effectiveness, and distinctiveness.Furthermore, alongside the consumption of Sleepasil, personal tips from the company’s executive shared on how to get a better sleep, such as dimming the lights, keeping the room cool, and avoiding gadgets before bedtime.It is recommended to take Sleepasil an hour prior to sleeping for optimal effectiveness, emphasizing its efficacy in aiding relaxation and promoting restful sleep.“Because of the other active ingredients, you’re getting not just a melatonin supplement but also a stress relief supplement. So, in just one product, you are already getting multiple benefits that you don’t have to outsource from other stand-alone supplements,” she concluded."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/07/campaign-to-eliminate-cervical-cancer-in-the-workplace-launched/,Campaign to eliminate cervical cancer in the workplace launched,"Cervical cancer is a type of cancer affecting the cervix. It is considered a preventable disease and is curable when detected early.However, the Department of Health (DOH) said it remains the second most common type of cancer among Filipino women ages 15 to 44 years old.To create awareness of the urgent issue of cervical cancer, Women Workers for Health Empowerment Network (WHEN), launched “Stronger Together than Cancer: A Cervical Cancer Elimination in the Workplace” campaign last March 3, 2024.The launch was in partnership with Jhpiego through its Centralized Laboratory Model for HPV Screening (CLAMS) Project, Quezon City Health Department, Department of Health, Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), and partners, and took place at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani in Quezon City.This initiative aligns with DOLE’s workplace cancer prevention guidelines and contributes to DOH’s national cancer control program, focusing on improving screening coverage and providing CCE-related information and services in the workplace.Dr. Julie Caguiat, WHEN Convenor, emphasized that this campaign is a significant milestone for our community.“By collaborating with different community partners and women workers, we aim to create a healthier workplace and contribute to the broader effort of eliminating cervical cancer. Prevention starts by empowering women to take charge of their health, and together, we can make a difference,” she said.“The Stronger Together than Cancer campaign will popularize women-led and worker-led initiatives for improved sexual and reproductive health outcomes, safer and healthier workplaces, and provide crucial information and services to women workers facing access challenges,” added Caguiat.Jacq Ruiz, WHEN Spokesperson, remarked, “Today marks the beginning of a transformative journey as WHEN joins hands with women to create empowered communities. Through collective efforts, we strive to enhance health empowerment for women workers, ensuring they have the tools and knowledge to protect themselves and their communities.”The launch also conducted a comprehensive free screening event using the newest technology of HPV DNA through self-collection with the support of Roche.This momentous event introduced HPV DNA testing as a secondary prevention strategy, aiming to simplify cervical cancer screening for women.“Since 2021, Jhpiego has worked closely with DOH, local government health offices, the private sector, and civil society organizations, introducing innovative approaches like HPV DNA testing through self-collection. Regular cervical cancer screening is not just a health measure; it is an act of empowerment and self-care. By taking charge of your health, you contribute to the well-being of your community and future generations. This aligns with WHO’s strategy to eliminate cervical cancer globally by 2030,” said Dr. Ingrid Magnata, Jhpiego Country Program Manager.“Jhpiego is committed to promoting women’s health globally. The Cervical Cancer Elimination in the Workplace Campaign is a testament to that commitment. Together with our partners, we aim to create a workplace where every woman’s health is a priority,” she added.The DOH reminded the following measures can help reduce the risk of having cervical cancer:Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/03/07/phap-calls-for-creation-of-circle-of-care-carers-law/,"PHAP calls for creation of Circle of Care, Carers’ Law","The Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines (PHAP), which represents the research-based pharmaceutical sector in the country, is strongly advocating the creation of a Circle of Care that will not only support cancer patients in their journey but their carers as well.Dr. Diana Edralin, PHAP President and General Manager of Roche, emphasized the need to treat cancer patients holistically because the disease is not only affecting the patient physically, but mentally and emotionally as well.“Treating a person as a whole is a marathon, not a sprint. It will not end tomorrow; in fact, we do not know when it will end. We need inspiration and support to continue with that journey. We need to pay attention to what is needed beyond medicines and we also need to nourish the mind, body and spirit,” she said.Dr. Edralin was one of the panelists in the discussion titled “Creating a Circle of Hope: Supporting Everyone on the Cancer Journey.” It was part of the Philippine National Cancer Summit 2024 which was held last February 29 to March 1, 2024 at the Novotel Hotel. The theme of the summit was “Advancing Integrated Cancer Care Systems for the Filipino.The other panelists were Dr. Necy Juat of the Philippine Society of Medical Oncology; Dr. Jun Ruiz, a gastroenterologist at The Medical City; Kathe Koran “Nikoy” De Guzman, Spokesperson of ICANSERVE Foundation Inc; and Carmen Auste, CEO of the Cancer Warriors Foundation. The panel discussion was sponsored by PHAP with the support of Teodoro Padilla, PHAP Executive Director.The PHAP president also introduced Roche’s “Strokes of Hope” advocacy which “support health and wellness activities of patients, survivors and caregivers through a meaningful art workshop that will help them express their inner thoughts and emotions and will enable them to explore positive outlets through art.”“This creative process will support our patients’ growth, increase insight, decrease stress, heal trauma and improve interpersonal relationships; therefore achieving a sense of fulfillment that will give them more hop as they fight cancer,” read the description of the program.The discussion also highlighted the need to look after the carer. Auste defined a caregiver as someone who is paid to look after a patient. A carer, on the other hand, is a family member, a neighbor or a friend who is tasked to look after the patient without any pay involved.According to Auste, the patient groups are drawing up the provisions of a Carer Law that will extend much needed support to them. These provisions will include a paid carer’s leave which will allow them to go on leave with pay and transportation and travel discounts for carers who need to accompany their loved ones to their check-ups.“It is also important that carers be given health cards because as they look after their patients, they forget to look after themselves and eventually, they end up being sick as well. There should also be provisions to prevent discrimination in the workplace for carers. The fact that carers have to look after a sick loved one should not hinder their chances of being promoted or from availing of training programs,” Auste added.Dr. Edralin added that there is also a need to capacitate carers because not everyone is trained to care for patients who are chronically ill. She pointed out that PHAP has partnered with the Department of Health to come up with Healthy Pilipinas which provides reliable information for patients and carers.“Pharmaceutical companies are also pushing for the institutionalization of patient navigation so that those who are diagnosed with cancer will know where or what to do,” she said.Dr. Edralin also reiterated the need for community support, for patients to connect with support groups and even use digital platforms to keep connected. It is also important to have an outlet where patients, carers and even doctors and allied medical professional can express their emotions and frustrations.“Art therapy is a good way to relieve depression. Strokes of Hope is the reminder of the day that you fell down but you know you survived. Art can be in different forms and the pharmaceutical industry is here to partner with you because ultimately, the person approach, the community approach, will complement what you have been doing and we will continue to listen to see how we can support your further,” she said.To build a circle of hope, Dr. Edralin said this can be done by “bringing all this passion and energy together.” While the journey will not be an easy one, Dr. Edralin said at the end of the day, “we need each other and we need to bring all our efforts together because this is the only way that this can be sustainable.”“A person approach means that we have to continue to stay connected as human beings. Medicine is the art, the paint brush is the human connections,” she said."

Ledesma Jr. assures President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. that members and their beneficiaries can expect better and more responsive health benefits packages that they can avail of at any accredited health facility nationwide. he declared. The PhilHealth Chief’s pronouncement came on the heels of President Marcos, Jr.’s recent call that Ledesma recently announced that the 30-percent increase in most of its case rate packages already took effect for all admissions starting February 14, 2024, the first time that an across-the-board increase was implemented since the all case rate scheme was launched in 2013. “ said Ledesma.Coverage for breast cancer under its Z Benefits Package also jumped from P100,000 to P1.4 million or an increase of 1300%. In 2023, the PhilHealth Board approved the expansion of its coverage of hemodialysis from 90 to 156 sessions per year. This has increased the annual benefit coverage of patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 to P405,600 from P234,000. In 2023, PhilHealth paid a total amount of P17.43 billion for hemodialysis claims alone.PhilHealth also significantly increased its coverage for certain conditions that are included among the high burden disease in terms of finances and effect on the quality of life of patients. It increased the benefits packages for acute ischemic stroke from P28,000 to P76,000; and acute hemorrhagic stroke from P38,000 to P80,000. Ledesma said these two packages alone have increased by 200% percent. adding that PhilHealth even improved its Z Benefits Packages for colorectal cancer and on selected orthopedic implants.In October last year, it launched the Outpatient Mental Health Package which provides outpatient coverage for general and specialty mental health services for P9,000 and P16,000 per patient annually, respectively. The Agency is partnering with the National Center for Mental Health for the initial implementation of the package and is currently contracting more providers at the grassroots level to make this even more accessible to more than three million Filipinos with mental health conditions. PhilHealth was able to implement the benefits enhancements despite the suspension of the scheduled adjustment in contribution rate in 2023 from 4 percent to 4.5 percent. he added.For 2024, members have more to expect from PhilHealth. said Ledesma. He further said that guidelines for outpatient therapeutic care benefits package for severe acute malnutrition in children aged 5 years old and below and services for physical medicine and rehabilitation will also be expected this year.Another benefit to look forward to is the enhancement of peritoneal dialysis under the Z Benefits Package. he stressed.For 2024, the Agency has allotted some P243 billion to pay for these benefits, P30 billion of which is earmarked for its PhilHealth Konsultasyong Sulit at Tama or Konsulta package. The Konsulta will be further expanded to include treatment for TB, animal bite, malaria and HIV/AIDS. This is in addition to expanding coverage for medicines from the current 21 to 53 through PhilHealth’s Guaranteed and Accessible Medications for Outpatient Treatment or GAMOT. Ledesma vowed."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/02/15/smile-train-philippines-puts-a-smile-on-every-childs-face/,Smile Train Philippines puts a smile on every child’s face,"Cleft lip and cleft palate are some of the most common congenital conditions in the world, where an estimated one in 700 babies is born with a cleft globally.The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) defines cleft lip and cleft palate as “birth defects that occur when a baby’s lip or mouth do not form properly during pregnancy,” and are commonly called “orofacial clefts.”Generally, people affected with a cleft condition may experience difficulty in eating, breathing, and speaking. However, from a psychological standpoint, many of them often experience bullying and other forms of torment, whether physical or emotional, which can negatively impact learning at school and ultimately employment as an adult.SMILE Train is a global organization that helps empower local medical professionals with training, funding, and resources to provide free cleft surgery and comprehensive cleft care to children globally. Here in the country, its local counterpart, Smile Train Philippines, has been one of the organizations that is at the forefront of creating awareness on the importance of early detection of cleft problems in babies, which should be done by three to four months for cleft lip, and nine to 12 months for cleft palate, and providing treatment for free.According to Smile Train Philippines Program Director Felix Grimares Jr., they dealt with about 5,000 surgeries of cleft each year and last year, Smile Train celebrated its 75,000th surgery. But despite these statistics, more babies still ask for care.Presently, he said what Smile Train offers is a comprehensive cleft surgery, where it will shoulder expenses not just for one but all surgeries if needed. It is an end-to-end package from pre-operation to post-operation, including medicines and laboratory tests during the course of the treatment. The number of surgeries may vary depending on the severity of the cleft. He said surgery for a basic cleft lip condition would normally take around 20 to 30 minutes; for palate, it would take about an hour because it’s more complicated.GRIMARES said admittedly, a lot of cleft patients have very minimal access to treatments, primarily due to the high costs, and PhilHealth does not cover that much. The Universal Health Care (UHC) law is now in its early stages of implementation, although the implementing rules and regulations have yet to be finalized. Hopefully, the UHC law can cover or improve the coverage for cleft treatment, which can be quite expensive, around P80,000 to P100,000, and can go as high as P150,000 in some hospitals. Of course, not all of these can be covered by PhilHealth, he pointed out, but they remain hopeful that as UHC progresses, coverage can also be expanded.“We have not yet begun talks with the Department of Health (DOH) but any form of support to Smile Train would be of great help, including coming from the legislature, which is something that Smile Train will explore. We are hoping that the movie can help push our advocacy.”Grimares said they have volunteer doctors who offer their time and services for free. Aside from the surgery itself, the package also covers pre-operative and post-operative needs like medication and the laboratory tests that comes after for the duration of the treatment, including speech therapy and orthodontics, even the lip revisions.At present, Smile Train has 60 doctor-partners nationwide doing surgeries, who are available anytime. Fortunately, he said, some of Smile Train’s partners are doing partnerships with local government units (LGUs). Some of their partners are doing surgeries in remote areas, and patients come from all over the country.With these conditions, there is a need for continuing treatment like for speech. Sometimes, the treatment depends on the age, and that the chance for recovery is higher when patients are younger, and that includes the speech plus psycho-social support. “Cleft patients are usually the ones subject to constant bullying so that’s also part of the development. Right now, we have been affiliated with two psycho-social departments, one at the Adventist University of the Philippines in Silang, Cavite, and at the Cebu Doctors’ University in Mandaue City in Cebu in terms of psychosocial support.”THE movie Grimares is referring to is “Every Day After,” a documentary helmed by Emmy-award winning director Elisa Gambino. It tells the story of the challenges and the enduring love of a sister determined to do everything she can to provide her brother with cleft condition all the love and care he needs.“Every Day After,” which held a private screening in Makati recently, provides a more nuanced look at the complexities of the healing process we don’t often see. More than showing health inequity around the world, the filmmakers wanted to show the real stories of cleft lip and palate patients, their families, and communities. More importantly, this film educates and raises awareness about this condition, dispelling myths and stereotypes, and promoting understanding and empathy towards those who live with it.The film was awarded Best Documentary in a number of international film festivals, including the Oscar-qualifying HollyShorts in Los Angeles, California, USA.For Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray, Smile Train’s Global Ambassadress for four years already, said she fell in love with her work on Smile Train. “I really believe in the system that they carry out. I’ve witnessed surgeries in over five countries around the world, including the Philippines. Being a spokesperson and ambassadress for the organization brings me a lot of fulfilment.”For kids and teenagers who were not immediately given treatment and have been subjected to psychological trauma, Gray said that when meeting with them, she always tries to find moments of joy like playing with them, for example. “As a child, being consoled in an adult way like saying ‘it will all be ok’ also has an impact but I believe that bringing children joy in simple ways allows them to be distracted. Most of them are nervous when they are about to undergo surgery, something which can be very daunting. I also converse with their family members or whoever their companion is, whether their parents or siblings. Although the child is the one receiving the surgery, a lot of the stress and the what ifs are on them. Giving them some form of strength is a wonderful thing that I could try to do, providing support to those who provide support since they are the ones who will be at the side of the patient while navigating through their cleft treatment journey.”Grimares also pointed to the financial impact on cleft patients, particularly with regard to employment. “Part of our program is we refer cleft patients to corporate partners to accept them for possible employment under their social responsibility efforts. A cleft surgery is really a life-changing one. Once the cleft condition is changed, it will also redound to a change in the life of the patient and give them the opportunity to live a normal life and get back to society and improve their quality of life.”"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/02/15/government-agency-raises-alarm-over-rise-in-teen-pregnancies/,Government agency raises alarm over rise in teen pregnancies,"The Commission on Population and Development (CPD) is closely monitoring the movement in recent numbers of pregnancies among very young adolescents nationwide, which saw a between 2021 and 2022.CPD noted a hike in total live births by young girls under 15 years old. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority’s most recent release of Registered Live Births in the Philippines, live births from this age group rose to 3,135 in 2022 from 2,320 in 2021, or went up by 35.13 percent.“Although live births from adolescent girls, 14 years old and below, is just 0.22 percent of total live births recorded, CPD is still deeply concerned about the increase in adolescent pregnancy, especially among our very young girls,” expressed CPD Executive Director Lisa Grace S. Bersales.Given the situation, Bersales is reiterating CPD’s call to its governmental partners and stakeholders to strongly support the agency’s call for the legislative branch to prioritize the passage of the “Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Bill.”“We cannot overemphasize the significance of having the bill enacted. It is my strong belief, and that of the agency’s, that its enactment will be essential in addressing the lingering concern of early child-bearing and motherhood among a great number of our juvenile Filipino girls,” said the undersecretary for population and development, or POPDEV.IN September 2023, the House of Representatives approved on its second reading , or the proposed “Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Act,” which provides for a national policy to arrest the growing number of cases of childbearing and childbirths among adolescents.Bersales reinforced Congress’ stand on the situation’s adverse effects not only on the affected persons, but on Philippine society in general: “I underscore Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez’s statement that this issue’s social cost and its negative impact on the national budget could run into billions of pesos—in terms of the government having to take care of young mothers and their babies; not to mention the human-development aspect that we have to take into consideration.”The CPD official pointed out that the bill’s passage will be vital in the implementation of the Philippine Population and Development Plan of Action or PPD POA 2023, which was approved by President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. via Memorandum Circular 40 on November 14, 2023. Under the action plan’s eight key strategies is the further advancement of Filipino teens’ health and development, where the phenomenon of early parenthood is specifically addressed. “PPD-POA covers bolstering of the implementation and promotion of Comprehensive Sexuality Education [CSE] in schools and communities, improved availability and access of adolescents to sexual and reproductive health and other social services, plus promoting and sustaining youth development and participation initiatives at the community level, with specific tactics to tackle adolescent pregnancies head-on at every level of society,” Bersales outlined.With regard to CSE and related measures, she insisted on the need to institute and support strategic interventions, such as those being implemented by the Department of Education that have effectively reduced dropouts due to teenage pregnancies. Recently, Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Z. Duterte mentioned in her “2024 Basic Education Report” that DepEd’s promotion of “Alternative Delivery Modes” was able to notably bring down the number of dropouts caused by teenage pregnancies and early marriages.“Above and beyond these well-laid plans of the government, it is our stand in CPD that the lasting solution to the prevalent concern of early teen pregnancies should begin at the household level,” the CPD chief emphasized. “While we exhaust efforts through a whole-of-government and whole-of-nation approach, we remind the parents and guardians of our youth that their roles in their respective families cannot be simply downplayed, as they are responsible in molding their children as productive members of the larger Philippine society.”"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/02/15/any-use-of-marijuana-still-punishable-by-law-doh/,Any use of marijuana still punishable by law—DOH,"Any use of marijuana is still punishable by law, the Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday.The DOH made this remark after the House Committees on Dangerous Drugs and on Health approved last week a bill that allows the use of medical marijuana.“The DOH reminds the general public that any use of marijuana at this point is still punishable by law, unless granted a compassionate special permit signed by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Director General that would allow its use and importation in the country,” the DOH said in a statement.“We shall keep the public updated should there be developments in the use of medical cannabis,” it added.The DOH said it recognizes the efforts of certain groups to legalize “medical cannabis use” which is different from recreational marijuana use.The agency said any initiatives should be based on the best available scientific evidence, weighed for cost-effectiveness and public health impact.“Legislation should also consider the regulatory capacity of all government agencies that will be involved should there be approval,” the DOH said.“However, the DOH does not support either the cultivation of cannabis plants or the manufacture of the cannabis product,” it added.The Philippine Medical Association said the use of marijuana for unproven medical indications is harmful.It said the legalization of cannabis will send a wrong message, especially to our youth, that the government considers cannabis as a safe substance, exposing citizens to unnecessary harm."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/02/14/cancer-survivor-pens-open-letter-to-pbbm-give-importance-to-cervical-cancer/,Cancer survivor pens open letter to PBBM: ‘Give importance to cervical cancer’,"Reggie Mutia Lambo Drilon, cervical cancer survivor, outspoken patient rights advocate, and current president of the Cancer Survivors Organization at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), is calling the attention of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr. to the plight of cancer patients, particularly female patients battling cervical cancer who are highly dependent on the government’s cancer health services for their treatment and survival.In an open letter to the President that Ms. Drilon published on their organization’s Facebook Page, just in time for the 5 anniversary of the enactment of the National Integrated Cancer Control Act (NICCA), she spoke of her hope that the President will recognize the physical, emotional, and financial burden of cancer and find the means to help the many Filipinas who are already afflicted, as well as those who will still be afflicted, by the disease. (Vaccination for many more [women and girls], expanded screening, and sufficient support for the patients who contracted cancer and are currently struggling to manage the disease, these are what we petition from you),” she implored the President.She harked back to her personal experience as a cervical cancer survivor, describing a decade-long pain-filled fight that rendered her unable to work and mired in debt—a common plight for many cancer patients. She also spoke of how cancer impacts the lives of not just the female cancer patients like her, but also the extended networks that provide what little support they can, only to feel helpless when the person they cherish—mother, wife, sister, friend—struggles to recover her health, or worst-case scenario, loses her life.Cervical cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer among Filipino women, said Ms. Drilon. Moreover, 11 women die from the disease on a daily basis; she says her own sister was one of the women lost to cancer. She expressed regret for learning too late that some types of cancer can be prevented, and that there is a vaccine that would have kept them both safe from cervical cancer.“(Please hear our plea, and give importance to cancer so that we prevent more women from contracting the disease, or from experiencing worsened symptoms and progressively deteriorating health due to the disease),” said Ms. Drilon. This Cancer Awareness Month of February, Ms. Drilon is raising awareness of the challenges experienced by cervical cancer patients, but also of the very real possibility that more women and girls will be saved through effective preventive measures such as expanded coverage for vaccination and screening, as well as quality and affordable cancer care, under a well-funded government initiative. The NICCA serves as the framework for all cancer-related activities of the government, including the National Cancer Control Program and the Cancer Assistance Fund.“(I am just one of many who are counting on the benefits under the National Integrated Cancer Control Act of the Philippines. We are hopeful that there will be a New Philippines for us, and for the cancer patients who still need assistance)” said Ms. Drilon. Read the complete letter on: . Ms. Drilon’s petition is aligned with the global initiative for cervical cancer elimination devised by the World Health Organization, where 90% of girls should be fully vaccinated with HPV vaccine by 15 years of age by 2030; 70% of women are screened with a high-performance test by 35 years of age and again by 45 years of age; and 90% of women identified with cervical disease receive treatment (90% of women with precancer treated, and 90% of women with invasive cancer managed). After a slow start during the pandemic, the Philippines needs to accelerate its efforts to meet these targets. ###"

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/02/13/renal-denervation-makes-waves-as-new-hypertension-treatment/,Renal Denervation makes waves as new hypertension treatment,"Are you struggling to keep your blood pressure in check despite medications and lifestyle changes? Turning off some kidney nerves might just be for you. At a recent medical consensus forum titled ‘Renal Denervation: A Blood Pressure Procedure,’ top hypertension specialists and interventionalists spotlight a new and promising approach for managing difficult-to-treat high blood pressure. The event was organized by the Philippine Society of Hypertension and the Philippine Heart Association, with support from Medtronic.Over the years, hypertension continues to be a health crisis in the Philippines. It is estimated that nearly every family is touched by high blood pressure in some way. Based on recent studies, 7 out of 10 older Filipinos are living with high blood pressure. With a high salt diet, coupled with a sedentary lifestyle, excess weight, and inadequate primary prevention care, hypertension has remained challenging to control for many Filipinos – a problem compounded by low health literacy on maintaining healthy blood pressure.Alarmingly, about 20-35% of patients have resistant hypertension-meaning their BP remains uncontrolled despite taking three or more blood pressure pills. “Hypertension is a silent killer here in the Philippines, leading to strokes, kidney failure, heart attacks. Unfortunately, some patients do not respond well to treatments even with multiple medications,” said Dr. Dolores Bonzon, President of the Philippine Society of Hypertension.Luckily, this might not be the case anymore. Now, an innovative blood pressure-lowering therapy called Renal Denervation (RDN) is making waves in medical communities worldwide, offering new hope for millions of people struggling to control their blood pressure.Designed for patients who do not respond well to conventional treatments, this 1 hour minimally invasive procedure uses radiofrequency energy to disable nerves surrounding the arteries to the kidneys that send signals to increase blood pressure. Disrupting these nerves helps relax the blood vessels, leading to a lasting decrease in blood pressure within 48 hours after the RDN procedure.“We’ve seen remarkable and long-term blood pressure reductions in patients treated with Renal Denervation. Many also felt improvement in their outlook and quality of life.” Said Dr. Jhoanna Marcelo, an Interventional Cardiologist from the Philippine Heart Center who has successfully performed multiple RDN procedures herself. This novel approach to controlling high blood pressure expands choices beyond just pills and diet and exercise for patients with lifetime maintenance medications for hypertension.“With better blood pressure despite less medication, patients were able to exercise without fear of blood pressure spikes and fewer risks for strokes.”Thanks to the recent development of a consensus statement and guidelines for using Renal Denervation in the Philippines, more medical doctors now have a solid framework for offering this innovative treatment to suitable patients. “The procedure is proven safe based on studies. Early patient cases locally have already shown remarkable results, too. Most importantly, the guidelines clearly describe which patients can benefit most from getting this treatment.” Said Dr. Raymond Oliva, a Hypertension Specialist at Philippine General Hospital and one of the authors of the Consensus Statement for Renal Denervation Treatment. Currently, Renal Denervation procedure is available in the following institutions in the country: Philippine Heart Center, St. Luke’s Medical Center, Cardinal Santos Medical Center, Manila Doctors Hospital, ManilaMed Medical Center Manila, Asian Hospital and Medical Center, and Cebu Doctors University Hospital.Start a conversation today. You have nothing to lose and potential years to gain. To learn more about how Renal Denervation can help reduce blood pressure, discuss your options with your physician or cardiologist."

In today’s modern era, that quest manifests in the scientific exploration of compounds like collagen, the protein that’s crucial for youthful skin, strong bones, and healthy, flexible joints. Did you know that collagen accounts for a staggering one-third of your body’s protein composition, making it the most abundant protein in the human body? This vital protein is the building block of not just your skin and bones but also your muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Collagen’s pivotal role extends beyond just providing structural support; it’s integral to the health and resilience of our skin, the flexibility of our joints, and even the strength of our bones. As we age, however, our body’s natural collagen production dwindles, leading to the common signs of aging such as wrinkled skin and less flexible joints. This has led to the global popularity of collagen supplements, especially hydrolyzed collagen drinks, into the spotlight for their potential to replenish declining collagen levels and support overall body health from the inside out.If you’re searching for a collagen drink that’s truly enjoyable, your quest may be nearing its end with the launch of Smarter Dose Collagen 5.Understanding the intricate relationship between inner health and outer beauty, Bambi Del Rosario-Young introduces Smarter Dose Collagen 5, a reflection of her vision to meld wellness with modern lifestyle needs.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/02/12/phl-cancer-summit-organizers-urge-filipinos-to-undergo-cancer-screening-for-early-detection/,PHL Cancer Summit organizers urge Filipinos to undergo cancer screening for early detection,"The Philippine College of Surgeons Cancer Commission (PCS CanCom) Foundation is encouraging the public to have cancer screening tests as early diagnosis is vital to higher survival among cancer patients.Based on data from PCS Cancer Foundation, the majority or 85 percent of those who get cancer are due to aging or unhealthy lifestyle and the remaining 15 percent are genetic or hereditary. A surgeon and specialist on colorectal cancer, Dr. Manuel Francisco Roxas who is also a chairperson of the PCS CanCom stressed that the key to cancer survival is early diagnosis.“For the majority of cancers when diagnosed early, they’re curable so, cancer can be curable when diagnosed early,” Roxas said during the recent Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum.Roxas who is also a medical director of the Ayala-owned Healthway Cancer Care Hospital raised concern that cancer is the third leading cause of death among Filipinos and is projected to rise due to the country’s aging population.In addition, the Department of Health Secretary Ted Herbosa informed the PCS Cancer Foundation that the government is planning to implement a program promoting cancer screening.“The health chief said the DOH wants to focus on cancer screening and prevention if the government’s screening program is good for the population of all healthy Filipinos. We will pick up cancer early, and hopefully, late-stage cancer will decrease, better survivors and less cost for expensive treatment.” Roxas said.Meanwhile, the PCS CanCom is looking forward to constructing the Philippine Cancer Center (PCC).“The Philippine cancer center will focus on the less common cancers, the more complicated cancers and they will be expert on it. For the more common cancers, the DOH hospitals with cancer centers will be more than ready to take care of them.” He said. The construction of PCC which is reportedly set to rise in East Avenue in Quezon City, is part of the mandate of the Philippine National Integrated Cancer Control Act (NICCA) which was signed into law in February 2019. The NICCA includes wide-ranging provisions covering the development of national and regional cancer centers. Currently, the country has 35 designated cancer control centers.In observance of World Cancer Awareness Day, the The The PCS CanCom together with the DOH, Cancer Coalition Philippines (CCPh), and the Philippine Cancer Society are convening a Philippine Cancer Summit this year, which will be held from February 29 to March 1, 2024, to provide free cancer screening examinations at Novotel in Quezon City where mobile buses will also be deployed for free screening for the public.They also organized a fun run and a cancer summit on February 11, 2024, at the CCP Complex.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/02/09/phl-winning-war-vs-smoking-with-balanced-holistic-approach/,"PHL winning war vs smoking with balanced, holistic approach","PANAMA CITY –– The Philippines is making significant strides in its fight against smoking through a “collective and balanced approach” that has helped bring down tobacco use from among adult Filipinos from 23.8 percent in 2015 to 19.5 percent in 2021.“This key achievement is the result of a collective and balanced approach, with whole-of-society and whole-of-government efforts in advocating and implementing effective policies and legislative measures,” Deputy Executive Secretary Hubert Dominic Guevara told the 10th Conference of the Parties (COP10) to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) being held at the Panama Convention Center.Guevara, who heads the Philippine Delegation, spoke on the conference’s opening session on Monday, February 5, to report the Philippines’ “notable progress” in implementing the FCTC since the country became a party to the treaty in 2005.Guevara said the Philippines has strengthened its multisectoral national strategy and coordinating mechanism on tobacco regulation and adopted new policies, including those that reduce tobacco harm.He pointed to the “Vaporized Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Products Regulation Act” (Republic Act 11900), which he described as a “landmark legislation” that “aims to reduce the harm caused by smoking” by establishing a “comprehensive and differentiated regulatory framework for the importation, manufacture, sale, and use of vaporized nicotine and non-nicotine products and other novel tobacco products.”Congress passed the measure in 2022 as part of the Philippine government’s holistic approach on tobacco control and regulation, joining other countries that have adopted “harm reduction” as part of their tobacco control strategies.Harm reduction is one of the three key “weapons” that parties to the FCTC may employ to control tobacco use. Article 1 (d) of the FCTC defines tobacco control as “a range of supply, demand and harm-reduction strategies” that member parties may adopt to “improve the health of the population by eliminating or reducing their consumption of tobacco products and exposure to tobacco smoke.”Harm-reduction strategies include the use of “heated or vaporized tobacco” in place of cigarettes, which are “burned.”There is a wealth of scientific evidence that the use of these so-called tobacco-harm-reduction (THR) products greatly reduces tobacco harm compared to smoking.In fact, at the Congressional hearing on the vaporized nicotine and non-nicotine products regulation bill in 2019, World Health Organization Representative Dr. Ranti Fayokun, scientist in the National Capacity-Tobacco Control Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases, told the House of Representatives that compared to cigarettes, using heated tobacco or vaporized nicotine is less harmful than smoking cigarettes.In New Zealand, smoking rate has dropped from 16.4 percent in 2012 to 6.8 percent in 2023 with several measures, including those that allow smokers to shift from smoking cigarettes to using heated (not burned) tobacco or vaporized nicotine, according to New Zealand’s report to the FCTC COP10 in Panama.New Zealand’s representative to COP10 said this was “achieved…through a mix of FCTC-endorsed measures, including regulation, community-based initiatives and targeted stop-smoking support.”“Our approach also involved a considered implementation of evidence-based harm-reductio measures that includes making a range of nicotine-replacement products available to people who smoke.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/02/08/public-private-collaboration-needed-to-make-affordable-medicines-accessible-to-filipinos/,Public-private collaboration needed to make affordable medicines accessible to Filipinos,"PUBLIC and private organizations are encouraged to work hand-in-hand to bring medicines and healthcare services closer to Filipinos, especially the underprivileged population.“Healthcare in the Philippines should not be synonymous to the following terms: expensive, difficult to access, only for the rich. Filipinos should not die because they can’t afford to buy medicines,” Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Dr. Teodoro J. Herbosa said in a televised message during the Access to Medicines Summit 2024 held at the Diamond Hotel Manila on February 6 and 7.The DOH chief’s statement was in reference to the increasing burden of shouldering exorbitant prices of medicines in the country on families. In fact, according to him, around 52 to 59 percent of the current health disbursement is attributed to household out-of-pocket expenditure, and 50.1 percent of the out-of-pocket expenditures were spent on pharmacies.Private hospital and community pharmacies are more than eight and four times higher respectively than international reference prices. The Philippine wholesale price for some medicines are up to two to nine times more than the member-countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).“DESPITE having comparative volume requirements for medicines, wholesale prices remain high in the Philippines. Retail prices of some branded generics already approximate the provinces of innovator brands. The realities on the ground are too difficult to ignore. While our health institutions have been discussing Universal Healthcare in opulent venues with overflowing food, Filipinos are finding it tough to access health services and medicines. Year by year, [it’s apparent] with the unavailability of services and medicines in their nearest health stations and centers, unavailable medications in government health centers and hospitals, and the absence of free medications and diagnosis,” he said.For Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited Head of India and Southeast Asia Growth and Emerging Markets Dion Warren, “ensuring equitable access to medicines is not just a matter of healthcare, but a fundamental human right.”Because the availability and affordability of medicines are a matter of life and death for countless individuals, accessing it becomes even more critical. Access to medicine means having access to healthcare facilities, trained professionals, diagnostic tools, supportive services, and the like.“It ensures that individuals can receive safe and effective care with necessary resources and the required expertise. Addressing challenges related to accessing medicine also goes beyond financial considerations. And while affordability is crucial, raising awareness and providing educational are equally important,” he noted.UNDERSTANDING that the challenge of improving access to medicine is not an overnight endeavor, Takeda Healthcare Philippines Inc. and RiseAboveNow Business Consulting Group continued to explore their collaboration in this year’s conclave, themed “Building Bridges. A Blueprint for Collaborative and Innovative Access to Medicines,” that focused on four key objectives.First, it highlighted successful efforts of organizations in improving access to medicines, serving as examples for others to learn from. Second, it fostered collaboration opportunities, promoting collective impact in enhancing access to medicines. Third, it initiated the development of a roadmap for stronger access to medicines through collaborative health innovations. Lastly, it advocated for policy changes and reforms to promote unbiased access to medicines across the region.The Access to Medicine Summit 2024 witnessed the participation of over 100 key stakeholders from the Philippines’ DOH, local government units (LGUs), academia, healthcare industry, patient support groups, financial institutions, and medical societies. It also featured 32 influential speakers from different sectors and nations such as Malaysia and Vietnam, who shared their expertise and commitment to shaping thoughts and driving change across Southeast Asia.“This summit marks a significant milestone in our collective journey towards improving access to essential medicines and health technologies. By bringing together diverse stakeholders from both the public and private sectors, we have created a valuable platform for sharing aspirations, showcasing progress, and identifying opportunities for collaboration. This convergence of times and efforts is crucial in addressing the challenges we face in ensuring equitable access to medicines for all Filipinos,” said Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go.AS the chairperson of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, he underscored the importance of investing further in the healthcare system, following the Covid-19 pandemic that caught the entire world by surprise, particularly those under-developed countries that were medically and economically unprepared to face such health crisis.“I continue to champion access to medicines for noncommunicable diseases,” Go said of the various initiatives he has taken to bring affordable yet quality healthcare services to Filipinos.One of which is his consistent push for additional budget for the National Integrated Cancer Control Program, particularly for the Procurement of Additional Drugs for Cancer and Expansion of Cancer Medicines Access Program, which was appropriated with additional P500 million in 2021 and 2023. For this year, the Committee approved P1.25 billion for the Cancer Assistance Fund, which can also facilitate access to needed medicines of cancer patients. Also, it constantly supported the additional budget for mental health medicines, which was reflected in the 2023 national budget that can still be used for this year.A known close aide to former President Rodrigo Duterte, he lauded his previous issuance of Executive Order (EO) No. 104, which imposes maximum drug retail prices on certain drugs and medicines in accordance to the Cheaper Medicines Act. The drugs covered by the EO include those which address chronic disorders, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, cancer and chronic pulmonary disease, among others.“I am urging the Department of Health and other concerned agencies to implement this effectively and ensure the availability, accessibility and affordability of medicines needed by Filipinos, especially our poor compatriots,” appealed Senator Go.ACKNOWLEDGING such a call for a collective public-private partnership, Takeda has already been supportive of the country in so far as making its life-transforming treatments more accessible to the local market.In an effort to bridge the affordability gap for patients affected with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, it launched the Patient Assistance Program in the Philippines in 2017 and expanded it other countries, including Indonesia, India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam.“In the Philippines, the financial burden of out-of-pocket payment for outpatient diagnostic procedures creates a significant barrier for patients. In recognizing this challenge, we collaborated with the Philippine Cancer Society to provide critical support and financial assistance for patients who require the CD30 testing. This is a specific biomarker to diagnose this disease,” Warren said.“Through this collaboration, we are breaking down the financial barriers that hinder access to essential diagnostic procedures. Together, we are making a tangible difference in the lives of patients ensuring they receive testing and the care they ultimately need. This is just a small example of the many efforts at Takeda’s undertaking,” he stressed.Image credits: Roderick L.

WEB Safe & Wise is its new initiative that focuses on addressing the risks emerging in the digital environment, while empowering children and young people to become effective digital citizens.Undersecretary Angelo Tapales from the Council for the Welfare of Children (CWC) and Margarita Magsaysay, OIC Executive Director of Inter-Agency Council Against Child Pornography (IACACP) to National Coordinating Center Against OSAEC and CSAEM, were among the speakers which also included Dr. Najat Maalla M’jid, the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations on Violence against Children; Julie Inman Grant, Australia’s eSafety Commissioner; Dr. Mikiko Otani, Immediate Past Chair of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, and officials from International Justice Mission (IJM), UNICEF East Asia and Pacific Office, ECPAT (End Child Prostitution and Trafficking) Philippines, ChildFund, and members of the tech industry including CleanDNS.“As the digital landscape continues to rapidly evolve, new opportunities for children and young people increase, but so do the threats they face online,” said Ryan DeSouza, Senior Advisor, Advocacy and Policy, and also head of the ChildFund’s WEB Safe & Wise initiative.“It’s imperative, therefore, that we work together—and with the children—to create a better digital world. ChildFund Alliance launched WEB Safe & Wise as a frontline defense against some of the most urgent risks to children online, including sexual exploitation and abuse of children,” added DeSouza.THE speakers all agreed that young people are powerful agents of change who must be involved in all stages of the process—from identifying the problem all the way through to implementing solutions to further protect children online.“Our goal, by working closely with children and young people, is to identify solutions they believe can benefit them, and also keep them safer, when they engage online,” said ChildFund Alliance Secretary General Meg Gardinier.The Children’s Advisory Council includes youth members from across the globe. Members of the Children’s Advisory Council who participated in the Safer Internet Day Event included young people from Ethiopia, India, Mexico, Mozambique, Paraguay, Uganda, Vietnam, and Philippines.Council member Azumi, who is from the Philippines, said she believes it is urgent that “all young people be given a voice in the fight for a safer online world.” Tihitina from Ethiopia shared that she is “eager to work on creating a web safe environment for children and young people and to contribute to driving change.” Moises from Mexico said he is seeking “ways to solve the challenges that girls, boys, and young people face in the online environment.”During the panel discussion, the youth representatives were asked “If you were a stakeholder, what actions would you take to keep children safe online?”Vidi from Indonesia underscored the two-pronged approach essential for online child safety: equipping parents with knowledge and raising broader awareness about the dangers children face. Vidi said one way to achieve this is by partnering with the government to develop educational materials easily understandable by children.As a member of the Children’s Advisory Council, Vidi and the other participants said they conduct activities, forums, and social media campaigns to educate children on how to stay safe online.IN the Philippines, the problem is so prevalent that UNICEF and IJM identified the country as the center of child sex abuse materials production. In the recent Scale of Harm report by the IJM, researchers found nearly half a million Filipino children in 2022 were trafficked online via live streaming, often by relatives or people they know, in order to produce child sexual exploitation material.Reynaldo Bicol, Jr., Director of IJM Manila Program Office, cited the factors that contributed to the proliferation of the crime which include language proficiency (almost everyone speaks English) making communication with international perpetrators easier, persistent use of social media platforms, and the accessibility of money remittance centers (facilitating quick financial gain).The country should also be vigilant about this disturbing trend—new forms of abuse, such as AI-generated imagery and financial sextortion—which are experiencing a significant increase, with dreadful consequences.For its part, the Council for the Welfare of Children promises to work closely with other government agencies to address online child sexual abuse and exploitation. Tapales said his department is working with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), as well as with the private sector to curb the violence and sexual abuse against children.Tapales shared that the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act (RA) 11930 or the Anti-Online Sexual Abuse or Exploitation of Children (OSAEC) and Anti-Child Sexual Abuse or Exploitation Materials (CSAEM) Act were signed in 2023.R.A. 11930, which amended the Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009, ensures the protection of every child against all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation, especially those committed with the use of information and communications technology (ICT).The IRR of the Anti-OSAEC law outlines the comprehensive guidelines and mechanisms to combat OSAEC, ranging from effective reporting to robust international cooperation. It covers the duties and responsibilities of the private sector, especially internet intermediaries and internet service providers, down to internet hotspots, cafes, or kiosks.The IRR also lists key instrumentalities in fighting OSAEC, including financial investigation of perpetrators, blacklisting of aliens, and age verification protocols.“What we want is stronger enforcement of the law because those provisions that would disrupt this crime are already there,” said Bicol.###"

Don’t self-medicate, consult with doctor","Prostate cancer is a type of cancer affecting the prostate, a small walnut-shaped gland in males that produces seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm. Like other types of cancer, it starts from one abnormal cell, and is thought to be caused by something that damages or changes certain genes in the cell.It is currently the third most common type of cancer among Filipino men, usually affecting older men, 65 and above , the Department of Health (DOH) said.However, the DOH said, the exact cause of prostate cancer remains unclear, but it likely involves various factors which increase its risk, including:Based on the Philippine Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) 2020, the number of new cancer cases in 2020 for both sexes and all ages is a total of 153,751 cases of which 8,242 (or 5.4 percent) were prostate cancer.Of these total number of cases, males of all ages who were diagnosed with cancer reached 67,257, of which 8,242 or 12.3 percent were prostate cancer.For incidence, mortality, and prevalence by cancer site, prostate cancer is 5th in the rank of new cases. It is 9th in rank in the number of deaths with an equivalent of 3,164, or 3.4 percent.DIFFERENT people have different symptoms for prostate cancer. Some men do not have symptoms at all.Some symptoms of prostate cancer are:If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, other symptoms can develop. The most common site for the cancer to spread is to one or more bones, especially the pelvis, lower spine and hips, which can become painful and tender.AVOIDING risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent prostate cancer. Risk factors include cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol intake, and obesity; thus, individuals may lower their risk by stopping/avoiding cigarette smoking, limiting alcoholic intake, and exercising regularly.Other risk factors which may increase the risk of prostate cancer include vitamin E intake, folic acid supplementation, a diet high in dairy products and calcium.“However, an individual must ask a doctor first to assess whether avoiding these nutrients are necessary. Protective factors, on the other hand, include folate [found in green vegetables, beans, and orange juice] and the use of medications which lower the level of male sex hormones in the body. However, self-medicating with these drugs is discouraged, and one must visit a doctor to determine whether the use of such drugs is warranted,” the DOH said.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/02/08/organon-takes-center-stage-in-dyslipidemia-solutions-at-pha-pcc-midyear-convention/,Organon takes center stage in Dyslipidemia solutions at PHA-PCC Midyear Convention,"Cholesterol management emerges as a prevalent concern in the Philippines, with high cholesterol levels now identified in individuals as young as 20. The 8th National Nutrition Survey reveals that nearly half of Filipinos aged 20 and above exhibit borderline high cholesterol, signifying a significant, potentially unnoticed health issue affecting one in every two individuals. Specifically, 46.9% of this demographic grapple with this condition.Highlighting the preventability and treatability of cardiovascular disease, healthcare company Organon Philippines is dedicated to public education and supporting initiatives aimed at updating doctors on the latest clinical practice guidelines for cholesterol management. To further these efforts, Organon actively participated in the recent Philippine Heart Association (PHA) – Philippine College of Cardiology (PCC) Midyear Convention 2024 in Clark, Pampanga. The convention, with a theme “Cardiology for All”, provided valuable insights into recent developments in cardiovascular disease management, featuring expert-led sessions and practical workshops.One of the key lectures titled “Addressing the Urgency ‘Treat to Goal’ in Dyslipidemia Management”, cardiologist and lipidologist Dr. Lourdes Ella Santos of UP-PGH CSCMC highlighted key findings from RACING Study. This study suggests that among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), using a combination of a moderately strong cholesterol-lowering medication with another drug called ezetimibe is just as effective as using a higher dose of statin monotherapy. They found that both approaches were equally effective at preventing serious heart problems like heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular-related deaths.Dyslipidemia characterized by a high level of cholesterol and/or triglycerides or a low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, poses a notable risk for heart problems, especially when it comes to keeping LDL-C levels in check to prevent cardiovascular issues. Using statins is a common approach, but it might not always bring LDL-C levels down to the desired target when used alone. Combining statins with ezetimibe improves the effectiveness of lowering lipids. The combination of ezetimibe and rosuvastatin is recommended in studies for a more effective reduction in LDL-C levels and lowering the associated risk of heart-related events compared to using statins alone.The impact of this problem is starkly evident in the country’s mortality statistics. Based on the 2022 report by the Philippines Statistics Authority, ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of death among both men and women in the country. What’s alarming is that younger Filipinos are now being diagnosed with heart disease due to unhealthy lifestyle choices. This is attributed to poor dietary habits such as consuming an excessive amount of food that are high in saturated fats, trans fats, and easily digestible carbohydrates.The trend of bad cholesterol management in the country worsened when the coronavirus pandemic broke out in 2020. According to Dr. Santos, most people may have overlooked cardiovascular risk factors during the lockdown.Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death worldwide. That’s why professionals stand by a simple motto when it comes to LDL-C level management—the lower, the better. To lower LDL-C levels in very high-risk populations such as the Philippines, a single-pill combination of ezetimibe added to statin-based therapy is being advocated by healthcare professionals to introduce this treatment into their practice. The benefits of single-pill combinations (SPC) for high and very high-risk patients are the following:Dr. Santos also pointed out the benefit of healthcare practitioners nationwide keeping themselves up to date with therapies such as the single-pill combination, which is now becoming a standard of therapy first line. “We want everyone to be comfortable with using single combination therapies even as first line lipid-lowering therapy options.” said Dr. Santos. “As we talked about yesterday, and today, when you have patients that are classified as very high risk, with a 10-year risk of developing a stroke or heart attack that is high, then the recommendation now is to consider starting these patients on single-pill combination therapy off the bat.”Guidance, early identification, and regular monitoring are essential elements that contribute to successful cholesterol management. It is advisable for all adults to undergo counseling regarding a nutritious diet and lifestyle to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Assessing lipid profiles and calculating risks aids in recognizing symptoms of CVD. Those at higher risk for cardiovascular disease should receive guidance on adopting healthier lifestyle and dietary practices to reduce their risk. Moreover, a collaborative decision-making process should be employed to determine the most suitable options for medium-intensity statins, particularly for primary prevention if desired. ###"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/02/07/international-pharma-health-care-expo-slated-from-february-14-to-16/,"International pharma, health-care expo slated from February 14 to 16","The , the largest pharmaceutical, medical and healthcare exhibition in the Philippines, which aims to capture the untapped market of the Southeast Asian Region through the Philippines, is expecting to house over 130 exhibitors and 4,000 visitors from nine participating countries during its three-day event. The international expo, which is jointly organized by Uniglobal Exhibitions and ACE Group, is one of the shows in the umbrella of upcoming shows being organized in the Asean region. According to Uniglobal and ACE, the event will be hosting medical professionals, pharmacies, hospitals, health organizations, importers and exporters, decision makers and medical practitioners of the Asean region in the Philippines.Aside from the Philippines, other participating countries are India, Turkey, Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam, China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Israel.ACE Group is a New Delhi-based organization, which organizes trade exhibitions across the globe. The group said it has been dealing in over 60 international trade fairs taking place in over 20 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, America and Oceania.Meanwhile, Uniglobal Exhibitions and Services (UES), which is also based in New Delhi is also experienced with organizing trade exhibitions worldwide, dealing in over 20 International Trade Fairs taking place in over 10 countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA), Asean, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Asia. Citing global data, the partner-organizers for this trade show noted in its event brochure that the Philippines pharmaceutical market will grow to reach P241.9 billion or equivalent to $3.7 billion in 2025 following the introduction of the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act, enabling the already high Indian pharmaceutical imports in the country to “increase further.”The organizers noted that in 2018, India was the top import partner of the Philippines contributing 12.6 percent of the total pharmaceutical imports into the country.In 2018, generics accounted for 76 percent by volume of the total pharmaceutical market in the country.Uniglobal and ACE said the visitors that are expected to flock to the expo from February 14 to 16, 2024. The organizers of the trade event said pharmacists, heads of medical institutions, heads of regional health authorities, pharmacologists, hospitals are among those that will attend the trade event. Pharma machinery importers, pharmaceutical firms, technologists, practicing physicians of different specialties, regional dealers and distributors are also expected to visit the three-day expo. From the medical profession, the organizers said doctors, nurses, paramedics and head physicians are also among the visitors. Meanwhile, trading companies, manufacturers and businessmen and importers and exporters are also expected to establish partnership at the said event. The organizers highlighted different reasons to participate in the exhibition. For one, India-based organizers said the Philippine pharmaceutical market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 1 percent within the 2017 to 2026 timeframe. They highlighted that the Philippine pharmaceutical market was valued at $3.3 billion in 2020.Moreover, the Filipino pharmaceutical industry is one of the “fastest-growing” industries in the country and is home to over 14 of the world’s top 20 pharmaceutical companies, the organizers noted.For the Philippine medical devices market, the organizers said it is seen to grow at a CAGR of more than 8 percent during the period 2021 to 2023. In 2021 alone, they noted that the local medical devices market was worth $747 million.“The major medical devices imported in the country are catheters, sutures, surgical masks, computed tomography [CT] scans systems, X-ray units, and ultrasound systems,” the organizers noted.Meanwhile, they said local production is limited to prototype units, spare parts (including improvised parts), and disposables, such as surgical gloves, syringes and needles."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/02/01/financial-health-means-better-health-greater-dividends/,"Financial health means better health, greater dividends","IN a learning session on financial literacy conducted by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas–Economic and Financial Learning Office (BSP-EFLO) in Northern Mindanao last year so that people may understand and appreciate the value of financial health, Atty. Clarence Joseph Zosa said financial planning is for financial health.“If we need to take care of our physical health so we don’t get sick, we also need to take care of our financial health. Because if you plan your finances wisely, you will know where your money will go and how much you will spend. So, there will be no overspending,” he said.He also emphasized the value of saving so that they are prepared for any eventualities in life or unexpected events like calamities brought about by natural disasters, sickness, accidents, health epidemics such as Covid-19, and more importantly, death.In this regard, people can also invest in financial instruments that would allow them to prepare for any of life’s many consequences, particularly for health and other future needs. One such instrument is through pre-need plans.PRE-need plans that are offered by pre-need companies are meant to address specific financial needs such as coming up with a retirement fund, educational plans to get a child’s education needs on track, cash benefits upon an individual’s death, mortuary needs, fund to cover hospitalization expenses, and many more.Based on Insurance Commission data, the number of pre-need plans sold during the first six months of 2023 amounted to 419,044, or a 27.66-percent spike from the same period in 2022. This may mean that many more Filipinos are becoming more aware of the need to invest and save for future needs.However, the majority, or about 99.89 percent, of the pre-need plans sold during the first six years of 2023 were memorial plans, 429 were pension plans and education plans with 10.FOR Ronald Bautista, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer of pre-need solutions provider PhilPlans, his advice to Filipinos is to be healthy and remain healthy for it will reap greater dividends for them.“It’s already a cliché that ‘health is wealth.’ But we also need to remember that by being and keeping ourselves healthy, it will mean more benefits to us,” Bautista said the during the recent launch of its new slogan for this year, “Tomorrow Starts Today,” an enhancement of the company’s previous mantra “Think Ahead” that has served the brand for many years, which also invites the public to act for a better tomorrow without delay.The launch also served as the venue where PhilPlans announced aggressive marketing efforts ahead of its celebration of its 35th anniversary on April 19, 2024, among which are the launch of a customer portal on the second quarter of this year for better real-time plan management, convenience in providing updates, and achieve a level of control to meet the demands of today’s digital-savvy consumer.BAUTISTA also said that part of the company’s initiatives is to generate more awareness about the importance of pre-need planning or more importantly, preparing for the future especially health concerns, and not to treat investing in pre-need plans as nothing but an expense.“We need to emphasize that the community should be aware of the beauty and the wisdom of savings especially for the rainy days like in terms of our health and well-being. This was highlighted during the time of Covid-19, which served as an eye-opener where more people became aware that they will have to have money in the future in times that they may lose their jobs or become ill. There remains the possibility that you can lose your job, be hospitalized, and yet you have no HMO to cover expenses, and that’s a scary fact,” Bautista explained.He added that the beauty about PhilPlans’ products, especially the pension plans, is that they are flexible and serves as funding mechanisms for anything that people will need in the future, particularly those already at age 65 and up where their health situation may become vulnerable. “With our plans being flexible, people can save money that they can use for any expenses for any emergency situation in the future as long as they are able to complete payments for five years.”THIS was particularly true during the time of Covid-19 where many people were hospitalized but fortunately, the PhilPlans planholders were able to get money to pay for their hospitalization expenses through their pension plans since many do not have health maintenance organization (HMO) packages.Bautista also reaffirmed the company’s commitment in helping Filipinos secure a better tomorrow, especially for the modern generation of Filipinos through digitalization, proactive planning, and “stepping into a future where tomorrow starts immediately.”“We don’t just sell pre-need plans. We also serve as partners in the planning for a secure and peaceful tomorrow. Our digital transformation, product innovation, and brand evolution are all fueled by this core purpose. We are excited to embark on this journey with our clients, hand-in-hand, as we build a future where tomorrow starts today,” Bautista concluded."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/02/01/20th-national-dental-health-month-commemorating-decades-of-putting-healthy-bright-smiles-on-pinoys/,"20th National Dental Health Month: Commemorating decades of putting healthy, bright smiles on Pinoys","MARKING the continued success of the combined efforts of the national government, dental communities and stakeholders in promoting good oral health in the country, Filipinos now have more reasons to smile as the entire nation observes the 20th National Dental Health Month (NDHM) this February with the theme “Celebrating Decades of Healthy Smiles.”NDHM started in 1951 as a National Dental Health Week. It became a month-long celebration under the Presidential Proclamation No. 559 series of 2004, giving much emphasis and attention to the importance of oral health.“This occasion not only marks a significant milestone since the Presidential Proclamation No. 559 in 2004, but also underscores the pivotal role that oral health plays in the overall well-being of our nation,” Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Dr. Teodoro J. Herbosa said in his recorded speech televised during their kick-off event held at the Mall of Asia Music Hall in Pasay City last January 28, 2024.“The NDHM Bente celebration also serves as a testament of our shared commitment in promoting good oral health practices and creating a nation with healthy smiles,” NDHM Bente Chairman Dr. Alvin M. Laxamana added.THE two most common oral health diseases in the Philippines are dental caries (tooth decay) and periodontal diseases (gum diseases).Based on the initial results of DOH’s 2018 National Survey on Oral Health, 73 percent of Filipinos suffer from dental caries, of which 83 percent come from the age of five to 12; as 43 percent of the population have gum diseases. Such figures for tooth decay and periodontal diseases, however, have gone down to 24 percent and 26 percent, respectively, compared to 2014.“These reflect not only the journey we have traveled for 20 years, but also the lasting impact we have made on the oral health of our fellow Filipinos,” Laxamana noted. “While it’s encouraging to see a reduction of dental disease prevalence, it is important to acknowledge that there is room for improvement.”One of the things to work on in so far as improving public oral health is concerned is the challenge that extends beyond affliction since accessibility to dental services remain an obstacle for four out of 10 Filipinos who do not have access to dental care, according to the DOH chief.“Oral diseases not only affect the quality of life, but also contribute to other health concerns. A healthy smile is not just an aesthetic consideration. It is a fundamental aspect of overall health and well-being,” he explained.BRINGING a healthy, beautiful smile on the face of every Filipino is everybody’s business.Recognizing the urgency of tackling oral health issues, the DOH, being the state’s arm that is responsible for ensuring access to basic public health services by all Filipinos, has implemented strategies to address this problem in the pursuit of Universal Health Care through the health sector’s 8-Point Action Agenda.“The oral health program is integrated in the general health services at all levels of care. The main direction of the program is towards improving access to dental treatment and preventive services, promoting oral health awareness, addressing the root causes of oral health problems in order to bridge the gaps, and making oral health becomes a reality for all,” Herbosa said.For its part, the Philippine Dental Association’s (PDA) Milyong Sipilyo, Angat Ngiting Pilipino program, which started in 1987, aims to collect a million toothbrushes to distribute in all public schools nationwide. Given this, each of the 120 chapters of this nonstock, nonprofit organization all over the country needs to raise at least 10,000 toothbrushes to fulfill their mission.To help realize this project, Colgate Palmolive Philippines Inc. signed with the PDA during the launch of NDHM Bente a Memorandum of Agreement for their partnership to this initiative.“We are very lucky to have a lifetime partner. For the whole program, Colgate has pledged to donate 4.7 million toothbrushes. Initially, we will [soon] distribute 1.7 million toothbrushes,” PDA President Dr. Emmanuel T. Centeno bared.This cause forms part of the Bright Smiles, Bight Futures (BSBF) program of Colgate, the leading oral care brand in the country. The BSBF has touched the lives of more than a billion of children in over 80 countries around the world. In the Philippines, it has benefitted over 40 million school children in the past 25 years. Since 1997, the program has reached over 37,000 public schools, 700 daycare centers across 390 cities and municipalities.“With the help of our partners, the PDA, Colgate’s BSBF program pledges to improve the oral health of Filipinos and work towards eliminating cavities through instilling in children effective oral care habits at a critical time when they’re forming lifelong health habits,” Colgate Palmolive Philippines Inc. Director of Marketing Oral Care Nica Marquez Whang said.“Through the BSBF, children learn how to properly brush their teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste like Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection, and they also get free access to dental services that would otherwise have been out of mind and our of reach. For example, proper and regular application of fluoride varnish and the regular dental checkups,” she added.FOR this month-long occasion, the PDA, alongside its partners and stakeholders, will host a series of initiatives and educational awareness about oral health.“That’s fostering growth and collaboration with dental health professionals’ community and stakeholders,” Centeno noted. “We are always ready to choose the most valuable program that will contribute to a better oral health of our community.”NDHM Bente’s calendar of events, dubbed “Isang Bisig sa Kasalusugang Pang-ngiti,” will feature a townhall meeting, focused on promoting oral health awareness across all ages in different identified regions in the country.In the execution of the recent MOA signing for PDA’s partnership with Colgate, the first leg of Isang Milyong Sipilyo toothbrushing drill will be held at the Timoteo Paez Elementary School in Pasay City on February 5. This will be followed by similar activities in Iloilo on February 26 and Davao on March 24.“We have a long way to go in instilling good oral health as among the top priorities of life. But this constant effort of our association through our chapters, affiliates, society, and integrated organizations, we will bring that much-needed focus on every Filipino,” he said.Image credits: Roderick L.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/02/01/cardiac-rehab-is-key-to-heart-disease-recovery/,Cardiac rehab is key to heart disease recovery,"The Department of Health has been constantly reminding Filipinos to take care of their hearts as heart diseases remain to be the biggest threat to Filipinos’ health.According to the World Health Organization (WHO) mortality database, cardiovascular diseases (ischemic heart disease, stroke) are one of the top global causes of death.Despite these findings, hope is not lost as there is one procedure that can help Filipinos recover from or improve their health after heart disease: Cardiovascular Rehabilitation.Cardiovascular rehabilitation, or cardiac rehab, is a medically-supervised, individually designed program that includes exercise, counseling, and education.Patients who may need cardiovascular rehabilitation include those who have recently suffered a heart attack, those with chest pain or stable angina, and those with chronic heart failure and peripheral artery disease.A chance to recover at Manila Doctors Hospital Cardiovascular Rehabilitation is one of the hospital’s most recent services to open under the Cardiovascular Center.The Preventive Cardiovascular Rehabilitation (PCARE) Unit highlights its active, collaborative method of addressing a cardiovascular patient’s needs to ensure that they recover effectively in a safe and comfortable setting.Rehab is also recommended for people who have had surgeries such as coronary artery bypass, valve replacement or repair, and those who have had procedures done like percutaneous coronary intervention and pacemaker insertion.It requires a multi-disciplinary approach in implementing each of the rehab phases. This means that a patient will receive care, information, and guidance from a team of healthcare professionals coming from different specialties.The rehab process will usually involve the patient’s attending physician and a cardiologist specializing in cardiovascular rehabilitation.Established in 2014, the PCARE Unit began with rehabilitation services for coronary artery disease and heart failure patients, such as those who have had procedures like coronary artery bypass graft and percutaneous coronary intervention.Its new office at the 8th floor of the Norberto Ty Medical Tower inside the MDH complex allowed the unit to expand its services and cater to patients recovering from peripheral arterial disease.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

If everything goes as planned, another eagle is set to land in St. Luke’s Medical Center Quezon City very soon.The eagle being referred to is the da Vinci XI robotic surgical system, making St. Luke’s Medical Center the first in the country to acquire the latest robotic surgical system. This cutting-edge technology reaffirms the institution’s commitment to delivering exceptional medical services and solidifies its position as a leader in the healthcare industry.At the launch of the da Vinci XI, Dr. Dennis Serrano last January 29, 2024, President and CEO of St. Luke’s Medical Center, recalled that when St. Luke’s decided to buy the first robot, the da Vinci SI, back in 2010, there was no precondition of a return on investment (ROI) because “it was an investment in science, an investment in the care of patients.”“It was also a testament of the dedication of St. Luke’s to push cutting edge technology. We are the first hospital to recover our investment and now we are the first hospital to get the XI,” Dr. Serrano said.More importantly, Dr. Serrano said St. Luke’s has the best outcomes in robotic surgery, adding that it will be the patients who will benefit from all of this.“As leaders in our field, the only way that we can advance is to push everything forward so that we can attain greater achievements,” he said.According to Dr. Serrano, the hospital decided back in 2019 to purchase a new robot. However, the pandemic happened and the supplier was having difficulty meeting the demand for the robotic surgery platform when the situation started to normalize.“It was really a matter of availability. The entire world was getting the new machine and they could only produce so much and the demand in the Asia Pacific Region was the last to be addressed. So finally, after a long wait, it’s here,” he said.Dr. Serrano also announced that St. Luke’s had already made a downpayment on a second da Vinci XI which will be placed in St. Luke’s Quezon City. The move is meant to align both hospitals and bring the level of care in both hospitals to the same level.“St. Luke’s Quezon City is currently undergoing a big redevelopment. We are expecting the robot to arrive in March. The program is existing in this hospital and the expertise is there. A robot in Quezon City will mean that the patients who need to undergo robotic surgery will no longer need to be transported to Global City,” he explained.THE da Vinci XI robotic surgical system represents a remarkable leap forward in surgical precision and minimally invasive procedures. This state-of-the-art platform allows surgeons to perform complex operations with enhanced precision and control, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.Enhanced visualization. The system offers 3D high-definition visualization, providing surgeons with a crystal-clear view of the surgical site. This heightened visibility allows for precise maneuvering and greater accuracy during procedures.Minimally invasive approach. The robotic-assistant system facilitates smaller incisions, resulting in reduced scarring, less blood loss, and shorter recovery times for patients. It also minimizes trauma to surrounding tissues, leading to a faster return to normal activities.Expanded surgical capabilities. With its versatile design, the da Vinci XI offers a wide range of applications across various surgical specialties allows St. Luke’s to provide comprehensive care for a diverse set of patient needs.Dr. Hermogenes Monroy, Head of St. Luke’s Institute of Surgery, said the da Vinci XI has been described by institutions abroad as a “game changer” as more patient procedures can be done faster and easier.Some of the general surgery procedures that can be performed through robotic surgery include rectal surgery, colorectal surgery, procedures from the upper gastrointestincal tract and hernia.“For the doctors it is really a matter of us being able to do complex surgeries in less time that will eventually translate to lower cost. That’s because part of the cost here is the cost of anesthetics. The longer we do our surgeries, the higher the cost involved,” he said.“The hidden advantage here is that the patient can go back to work earlier. There is a hidden cost that we cannot compute for our patients. If we are able send them back to work in two weeks’ time, the one and a half months the patient can save for their families is a huge advantage for them,” he added.DR. Marie Cruz-Jaiver, an Obstetrics-Gynecologist, related that she has “seen the advantages of doing robotic surgery for gynecological procedures.”“I see the difference in terms of ease of surgery, ease of dissection, preciseness specially with myomectomy [surgery to remove uterine fibroids] which is very cumbersome. We can see the advantage of using robotic surgery on patients with higher BMI [Body Mass Index] and that was using the old robot. We are excited to do multiple procedures during one procedure, the ease of moving and excising. We are looking forward to shorter recovery period,” she said.For their part, Dr. Josefino Castillo, Head of the Institute of Urology, said robotic surgery is the gold standard when it comes to prostatectomies.“The robotic surgery platform has revolutionized the management of prostate cancer. We have already performed more than 2,000 radical prostatectomies. The surgeons have the expertise and we are supported by very dedicated nurses and allied staff,” Dr. Castillo said.Dr. Serrano reiterated that while St. Luke’s will be pushing for a return on investment on the da Vinci XI, the patients will always come first.“We have robotic surgery packages and we have decided that the packages will not be changed even if the machine is new. The price of the packages should be close, if not only a big higher mainly because of inflationary reasons. The pledge is that the patients will get the same surgery with the new robot,” he said."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/01/29/with-a-national-action-plan-cervical-cancer-could-be-a-thing-of-the-past/,"With a national action plan, cervical cancer could be a thing of the past","In the Philippines, cervical cancer kills 11 Filipinas every day. It is the second most common cancer afflicting women in their prime years – those between the ages of 15 and 44. It is typically caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), a common sexually transmitted infection. In terms of mortality-to-incidence ratio, cervical cancer trumps breast cancer among the cancers that affect women. Globally, cervical cancer has a 52% mortality-to-incidence ratio compared to breast cancer, which currently stands at 37%. This reflects not only the number of deaths due to the disease, but also the existing inequities when it comes to cancer control programs.Despite this alarming reality, cervical cancer is one of the most preventable and successfully treatable forms of cancer, if it is detected and diagnosed early, and managed effectively. In fact, cervical cancer can be the first cancer to be eliminated if public health authorities act now to achieve this goal.The understanding of HPV and its connection to cervical cancer has been a breakthrough toward disease control. It has enabled the development of effective preventative measures such as HPV vaccines, enhanced screening methods, and early detection, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful treatment and survival for women. While remarkable advances in innovation had been made, it is critical to ensure that these lifesaving measures are accessible to girls and women in various socioeconomic backgrounds. Accessibility to HPV vaccines, cervical cancer screening, and treatment is the genuine power of concrete actions.Having a national cervical cancer elimination plan can help alleviate the burden of the disease so that 11 Filipinas dying every day could be a thing of the past.The Philippine Cervical Cancer Elimination Movement (CCEM) is a civil society organization working tirelessly with various stakeholders to raise awareness on the prevention, treatment, and elimination of cervical cancer. Recently, the CCEM urged the national government to strengthen public health efforts under the National Integrated Cancer Control Program (NICCA), either through bilateral health cooperation or public-private partnerships, but all within the framework of a national action plan with clear commitments and timelines.“We hope that the national government issues a definitive statement on cervical cancer elimination, with targets and clear timelines,” says Alvin Manalansan, co-convenor of the CCEM. In doing so, the Philippines can enhance and strengthen its investments in preventing, screening, and treating cervical cancer, as well as in research and development, technical collaboration, and human capital development.”For a national action plan, the Philippines can build on the targets set by the WHO’s global strategy for cervical cancer elimination, as well as the APEC Cervical Cancer Roadmap (2021-2025). Launched in November 2020, with targets set for 2030, the WHO’s global strategy aims to achieve the following:Eliminating cervical cancer is also part of the APEC’s vision for women and girls to live healthy and productive lives. In March 2023, the APEC Health Working Group reported that, while APEC economies have made significant progress towards achieving the WHO’s targets, none have reached all three targets for vaccination, screening, and treatment.The 21 APEC economies are successful in reaching targets for cervical cancer treatment. However, to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, the APEC Health Working Group insists on increasing investments and uptake of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening. In the Philippines alone, fewer than 1 in 10 girls have received their final HPV vaccination dose, while fewer than 1 in 10 women have been screened for cervical cancer in the last five years.Indeed, the Philippines can do more to increase the uptake of HPV vaccination by the government making sure that anti-cervical cancer vaccines are more accessible to the young girls who need them the most.In the fight against cervical cancer, all sectors must collaborate. Collectively, we can equip women with the tools they need to fend off this devastating disease. By driving a concerted national action plan across the pillars of HPV immunization, screening, and treatment, the Philippines could eliminate cervical cancer by 2064."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/01/25/how-to-stay-healthy-during-cold-flu-and-covid-19-season/,"How to stay healthy during cold, flu and Covid-19 season","WINTER is here, inflicting its usual array of symptoms—coughs, nasal congestion, fatigue and fever—and, this year, a new Covid-19 variant is dominating the scoreboard. Covid-19 is leading hospital admissions among the respiratory viruses, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Last week, 25 US states had high or very high levels for respiratory illnesses with fever, cough and other symptoms. That’s down from 37 states the week before, the CDC said. Since the beginning of October, there have been at least 16 million illnesses, 180,000 hospitalizations, and 11,000 deaths from flu so far this season. The CDC said 47 children have died of flu.January can be the worst month for these illnesses. With vaccination rates low, what can you do to protect yourself from respiratory viruses, including influenza, Covid-19 and RSV?Hand-washing remains crucial to reducing the spread of viral infections. Take your time at the sink. Twenty seconds is recommended. If you feel silly singing “Happy Birthday” twice while you scrub with soapy water, count to 20. Slowly. Use hand sanitizer with 60 percent alcohol when you don’t have access to soap and water. Also, wear a mask in crowded areas. Increase ventilation in your workplace and home.IN the United States, only 17 percent of those eligible have received the updated Covid-19 vaccine, which provides good protection against the now-dominant JN.1 variant.It’s not too late to roll up your sleeve. While you’re at it, make sure you’ve had your annual flu shot. Those 60 and older may want to get the RSV vaccine, which also is recommended during pregnancy to prevent RSV in infants.YOUNG children seem to pick up every germ going around. Can their parents avoid getting sick?This time of year, children are indoors in close quarters with other kids, touching the same toys and surfaces, said Jennifer Sonney of University of Washington School of Nursing in Seattle. Some haven’t learned to cover their coughs and they simply haven’t been exposed to many illnesses, so their immune systems are still developing.It’s important to take care of yourself if you’re a parent or caregiver of young children, said Sonney who is immediate past president of the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners.“We know if you are sleep deprived or dehydrated or experiencing a lot of stress, that can compromise your immune function,” Sonney said.Having young children is very demanding, “so all of this advice needs to be interpreted within the context of reality,” she said. “Despite doing everything right, kids are still going to get colds.”A special note if your baby is sick: It’s a good idea to have saline drops and a bulb syringe at home. They can be used to clear mucus from tiny nostrils.“A couple drops of saline into one nostril and suction it and then do the other side,” Sonney said. “Doing that before eating and sleep is going to help a lot.”A home kit for children could also include acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fevers, tissues for runny noses and water bottles of sippy cups for staying hydrated.IF you do get sick, prompt testing can help determine whether you have Covid-19 or influenza. That’s important to see if you need one of the medicines that can help prevent severe illness: Paxlovid for Covid-19 and Tamiflu for flu.If you don’t have a test kit at home, look for a test-to-treat site at a pharmacy clinic or health center near your. There is also a free home-based test-to-treat program for adults who are uninsured or rely on government health insurance. APImage credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/01/25/intensify-fight-vs-dengue-as-rise-in-cases-seen-this-year/,Intensify fight vs dengue as rise in cases seen this year,"THE unsettling reality of dengue is imminent in the Philippines this 2024, posing a significant challenge to public health authorities and communities alike. Fewer storms may be experienced in the country, with the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration hinting that only 13 to 19 tropical cyclones could hit this year. This, however, is higher than the 11 storms that made landfall or came close in 2023. The onset of increased rainfall makes favorable breeding conditions for mosquitoes. Hence, the likelihood of an increase in dengue transmission. AMID a record global dengue spike of 5 million cases and more than 5,000 deaths last year, the Philippines has seen a decline, with the Department of Health’s (DOH) report of 125,975 dengue cases logged nationwide from January 1 to September 9. This so far is lower than the number of cases recorded five years ago on the back of the driest rainy season in recent history that is correlated to the decreased mosquito-borne diseases. The first quarter of 2023, though, saw a surge of 94 percent incidence to 27,670 compared to 14,278 during the same period in 2022, per the DOH data. This is very alarming as the initial three months are typically characterized by dry weather, which traditionally sees lower dengue cases compared to the peak of the rainy season.While this climatic pattern is seen to persist this year, with the peak of the El Niño phenomenon from February to April, per the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), the DOH reminded the public to be aware and cautious of the possible growth of vector-borne diseases like dengue, particularly in areas that have a limited supply of water and places that have stored water.SINCE most dengue cases do not have warning signs but have common symptoms such as fever, headache, body pain, vomiting and rashes, the DOH urges the public to practice the 5S: Search and destroy mosquito breeding sites, secure self-protection measures, seek early consultation, support fogging and spraying in hot spot areas, and sustain hydration.This strategy has been proven effective like during the dengue outbreak last year. At the local level, for instance, the City of Tagum, through its public officials, including health officer Dr. Arnel Florendo underscored the importance of these measures in eliminating mosquito breeding grounds when the local government unit (LGU) was put under a state of calamity. He also reminded their constituents of the importance of preventive measures such as using repellents, mosquito nets, installing screens in homes, and conducting regular clean-up drives to protect themselves from mosquito bites and eliminate breeding sites.Another example is the Zamboanga Peninsula region, where state agencies and healthcare providers have been on top of the ongoing fight against dengue, following the DOH’s report of a total of 7,491 cases posted from January 1 to August 12 in Region 9.HOSPITALS and clinics there have strengthened their capacity to immediately diagnose and treat dengue cases, ensuring that patients get timely medical attention. At the same time, these institutions have actively embarked on comprehensive public education programs to raise awareness among residents about the telltale signs of dengue and the significance of seeking early medical intervention.Such initiatives demonstrate that in a joint effort to curtail the spread of dengue, LGUs have intensified their commitment to controlling the mosquito population. Regular vector control activities, including targeted fogging operations in vulnerable areas, are being done with more vigilance.Beside the 5S strategy, there are more ways to address the dengue situation in the Philippines. Even if the country prevented a major outbreak compared to other nations in the record-setting year of 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a death toll of 575 as of October 19, making this island nation the third highest globally.The challenge is due to insufficient specific measures to directly avoid and cure dengue. While the 5S strategy focuses on eliminating mosquito breeding grounds, it may not directly resolve the prevention and treatment of the illness itself. This requires comprehensive measures that espouse vector control, effective diagnosis, treatment, and public awareness campaigns.So it is important to invest in research and development for new prevention methods like vaccines, and to strengthen healthcare systems to guarantee rapid and right treatment for dengue cases. A recent second-generation dengue vaccine that has been given the greenlight for use in over 30 countries but yet to be introduced in the Philippines. This dengue vaccine has shown higher efficacy in preventing the disease. Its introduction could be a crucial step forward in the national fight against dengue.In a recent interview with BioPHARMA Asia Pacific, Dr. Lulu Bravo, president of the Immunization Partners in Asia Pacific and current executive director of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination, said that the introduction of a dengue vaccine has reopened positive discussions on preventing the disease. She noted that the uptake of the vaccine is increasing among the public, and with ongoing education drives and effective communication, Filipinos are closer to hitting the goal of zero dengue deaths by 2030.The prevailing rise of dengue here and abroad calls for proactive measures to avert a potential health crisis in 2024. Today’s situation necessitates a comprehensive and multifaceted approach that entails not only vector control measures but also the integration of immunization as a key component of dengue control and management.Roderick L.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/01/25/growth-seen-in-local-pharmaceutical-industry-through-private-public-efforts/,"Growth seen in local pharmaceutical industry through private, public efforts","AN association of local medicine manufacturers said that despite the challenges and headwinds, it sees a bright future for the local pharmaceutical industry.The Philippine Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) was established in 1950 and produces about 32 percent of the drug products in the country, the majority of which are generics. Higinio Porte, Jr., President of the PPMA, said the local pharmaceutical industry is now at P257 billion or US$4.5 billion and is continuously growing at an average pace of six to seven percent.It posted the second biggest growth and is the third largest pharma industry in the ASEAN region, next to Indonesia and Thailand. It is about the same size as Vietnam’s but the Philippines is a bit bigger though unfortunately, two thirds of the Philippine market is dominated by multinational pharmaceutical firms. In the past five years, the growth of importation was at an average of 11 percent, which is almost double of the market’s growth.According to Porte, the capabilities of Philippine pharmaceutical manufacturers include research and development for natural and synthetic drugs. They can manufacture solid, liquids, semi-solids, topical, dry powder, effervescent, eye/ear drops, parenterals/injectables but not vaccines since they are all imported.“The government is pushing to have local manufacturing capabilities for vaccines in the country. In fact, to be launched this year is the establishment of a Philippine Virology Institute to be located in Clark, Pampanga, and the PPMA will participate in the preparation for that,” Porte said.He said that the industry also has robust warehousing, logistics and distribution facilities in the country’s business centers in provinces and cities. “We also have clinical and bio-equivalence testing centers for products manufactured locally, which means that the products are of the same quality and efficacy that is at par with imported ones because we are testing that and it is required.”The association also has “strong partnerships with the government such as the Department of Health [DOH], the Food and Drug Administration [FDA], the Department of Science and Technology [DOST], and more importantly the Department of Trade and Industry [DTI], which helped in the establishment of an Integrated Roadmap of the Philippine Pharmaceutical Industry [IRPPI] that we are starting to implement.”AMONG these, Porte said, is the continuous increase in fuel prices due to global economic instability, geo-political conflicts (tension between China and Taiwan), further decline of the Chinese economy, which may affect the supply of pharmaceutical materials.“Source materials from China are more affordable since they are promoting exportation to help the economy. However, this may not be sustainable since a lot of factories are on the verge of closing,” he said.There is also the threat of another pandemic, he said, plus cyberterrorism, and outflow of technical talents to other countries.HE sees opportunities for the Philippine pharmaceutical market with the full implementation of the Universal Health Care (UHC) program, which will double the size of the local pharmaceutical industry in the next 10 years. This is good for many Filipinos, Porte said, since prior to the UHC, only a third of Filipinos have access to the right medicine because majority can’t afford to buy medicines.“The UHC will provide for that. In the next five years, the target is to provide the necessary health care services to at least 20 million really poor Filipinos which, in turn, may help drive the growth of the local pharma industry because it includes provision of medicines to them,” Porte said.Other opportunities include the decision of the government to prioritize locally produced medicines and other pharmaceutical products, focus on the R&D of herbal drug products, especially those equivalent to the synthetic ones, which is being driven at by the government, particularly the DOH and DOST, plus the government’s drive on automation, digitization, and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve productivity.Amid the implementation of the UHC will be the IRPPI, with the aim for the country to be self-sufficient with regard to medicines, and help establish by 2030 a Philippine pharmaceutical industry with a resilient and agile value chain to ensure pharmaceutical security for Filipinos and achieve better health results. It will also enable local manufacturers to produce 60 percent of the country’s registered medicines making them major producers, as well as make the local pharma industry become a global player in terms of innovation and access.Corollary to this, Porte said, is the Philippine Medical Policy 2022-2030. Under this policy Filipinos should have sustainable access to quality and affordable essential medicines six years from now and reduced out-of-pocket spending, which was pegged at 70 percent prior to the UHC’s enactment.He also mentioned the Private Sector Advisory Council – Health Care Sector, whose goal is to help in the full implementation of the UHC nationwide by 2028, achieve sufficient number of human resource and bed requirements also in 2028, and substantially reduce out-of-pocket health care spending to about 30 percent in the same year, and 100 percent for the poor.When it comes to opportunities for the local pharmaceutical industry, Porte said being part of the 4th International Processing and Packaging Trade Event for the Philippines (ProPak Philippines), the biggest processing and packaging trade show happening on January 31 up to February 2, 2024 at the World Trade Center in Pasay City, the local pharmaceutical industry will enjoy access to available cost-efficient packaging materials to help lower the cost of medicine.The industry can also gain access to AI-equipped packaging equipment to increase production efficiency, the chance to collaborate with suppliers for product and packaging development and help promote sustainability such as “green” packaging materials, plus the potential to tap new clients.“In cough syrups, over 60 percent of its cost is in packaging, from the bottle to the cover and box, which makes the packaging more expensive than the medicine itself. We need the help of ProPak to provide us with better technologies at much affordable costs.”Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/01/25/health-tech-company-develops-portable-molecular-lab-for-educational-clinical-tasks/,"Health tech company develops portable molecular lab for educational, clinical tasks","In a groundbreaking move, leading healthcare technology innovator Manila Healthtek Inc. has unveiled the LaboraTrolley, a suitcase sized portable molecular laboratory that promises to revolutionize healthcare, education, and disease surveillance particularly in rural and resource-limited settings.Led by its founder and CEO, multi-awarded clinician and scientist Dr. Raul Destura, Manila Healthtek develops low-cost, accurate, and portable diagnostic tools available to all Filipinos.Its latest offering the LaboraTrolley offers a wide range of applications, from educational tools to bio-surveillance and clinical testing capabilities, positioning it as a versatile and crucial asset in the fields of education and healthcare.The first major application of the LaboraTrolley targets the education sector, offering high school students a unique and comprehensive science learning experience.Equipped with hands-on immersive features and a virtual learning module, the LaboraTrolley enables students to engage in practical experiments, thereby enhancing their understanding of molecular biology and related scientific concepts.“High school students would be able to experience PCR testing without spending too much,” said Dr. Destura, adding that the LaboraTrolley costs only a fraction of what it would cost to set up a complete molecular laboratory. The cost already includes training, supply chain management, troubleshooting, and after sales tech support all provided by Filipino scientists.PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests are a fast and highly accurate way to diagnose certain infectious diseases and genetic changes.Despite national efforts, reports highlight persistent challenges in equipping Filipino students with adequate science and technology knowledge. Dr. Destura said that this hands-on approach will equip students with practical skills and knowledge, fostering a deeper appreciation for the subject matter while preparing them for potential careers in biotechnology and medical research.Bridging the gap between the classroom and laboratory, this powerful combination of hands-on exploration and virtual guidance creates an effective and vibrant learning ecosystem that cultivates the next generation of science and healthcare professionals.In addition to its educational applications, the LaboraTrolley serves as a potent bio-surveillance tool for the detection and monitoring of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.With its portable design and advanced molecular testing capabilities, the LaboraTrolley is well-suited for field and outbreak investigations, allowing healthcare professionals and researchers to rapidly analyze biological samples and identify potential disease threats in real-time. This capacity to perform on-site molecular testing can significantly expedite response efforts during disease outbreaks, ultimately enabling more efficient containment and control measures.The ability of the LaboraTrolley to deliver rapid and accurate results makes it an invaluable asset in addressing public health challenges, particularly in regions prone to infectious disease outbreaks. Dr. Destura shared that by providing timely and precise data, this innovative technology empowers healthcare authorities to make informed decisions and implement targeted interventions, “thereby mitigating the spread of infectious diseases and safeguarding public health.”Furthermore, the LaboraTrolley serves as a clinical tool, offering capability for social hygiene testing, such as for diseases including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), HPV Human papillomavirus (HPV), Chlamydia trachomatis / Neisseria gonorrhoeae (CTNG), and others.“This aspect of the technology highlights its potential to enhance healthcare accessibility and improve disease detection in underserved and remote communities, where access to traditional laboratory facilities may be limited,” said Dr. Destura.By delivering rapid and accurate diagnostic testing capabilities directly to the point of care, the LaboraTrolley™ has the potential to significantly enhance disease screening and early detection efforts, ultimately improving health outcomes and reducing disease transmission rates.Notably, its clinical testing applications extend beyond traditional healthcare facilities, enabling healthcare providers to conduct comprehensive testing and screening in non-traditional settings such as community outreach programs, mobile clinics, and remote areas. This versatility empowers healthcare workers to reach underserved populations, leading to improved healthcare access and earlier interventions for infectious diseases.Manila Healthtek’s introduction of the LaboraTrolley represents a significant advancement in portable molecular laboratory technology, offering a glimpse into the future of education, disease surveillance, and clinical testing. As this pioneering technology continues to evolve, its impact on science education, public health, and healthcare delivery is expected to be profound, paving the way for a more informed, proactive, and resilient approach to addressing the world’s most pressing health challenges.Dr. Destura shared that one of their goals at Manila Healthtek is for their biotech company to grow and be globally competitive.“We are also looking into potential partnerships with international biotechnology organizations. These organizations might start considering the Philippine landscape for partnership instead of Korea, Japan, China, Singapore, Vietnam, and Malaysia.”“This will further trigger the growth of the country’s biotechnology landscape that will provide opportunities for our science and technology graduates and give them reason to stay and not leave their families in pursuit of their dreams to become scientists,” said Dr. Destura. “It’s a long shot, but everything begins with people believing in an idea and supporting it. Some agencies in the country, both private and government, have the power and capacity to help us make this happen because obviously, it cannot be done by the biotech company alone,” added Dr. Destura.For inquiries about the LaboraTrolley, e-mail Manila Healthtek at ."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/01/25/women-play-key-role-in-community-approach-to-health-herbalife/,Women play key role in community approach to health–Herbalife,"ALMOST three years ago, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened an ad hoc consultation meeting where it gathered researchers, practitioners, representatives of both government and multilateral agencies from across the globe to discuss community-centered approaches to health emergencies. Among the meeting’s objectives were to inspire new perspectives to tackling pandemic challenges through citizen engagement and participation.Many countries around the world have already adopted community participation as a major policy theme since the 1970s and is still considered an essential part in the crafting of health development policies. However, as years went by, it is slowly discovered that community participation in health development is really a complex process. According to a multi-country study, though community participation in health is largely considered a universal concept, its implementation varies per country depending on national and local situations from culture, political systems and decision-making processes.Here in the Philippines, Community-Managed Health Programs (CMHP), which is a form of Primary Health Care, were instituted to promote community self-determination and self-reliance in addressing health needs particularly in economically disadvantaged communities, but there is still a need to evaluate CHMPs and how they can help achieve better health outcomes.DR. Luigi Gratton, a US-based nutrition expert and Vice President of Product Training for Herbalife, a global nutrition company, said the company, for the past 40 years, believes in the importance of getting in touch with the community to promote overall health among all citizens, especially in the Philippines where the family-oriented concept remains very strong, and touched on the role of women in the community.He said that generally, the woman, who is not really the head of the household but the one who is “functionally” running the household, are the ones that create the community that pursues wellness goals, whether in their own household or the town or city. He added that the Herbalife business has always been dominated by mostly women, the mother or the leaders of the household, whether married or single, saying that direct selling has always been led by women, whether in cosmetic products, nutrition products, houseware, apparel.“It’s the women who tend to start the community, and it’s a great way for them to keep their children close and start a home-based business. And we believe that this approach worked largely in the Latin countries, which is more family-oriented, and it also works very well in the Latin-influenced communities as well. Even in India, which is different and is very broken up in terms of culture, the nutrition club concept is picking up but again, the family is a big part of the culture. That is why we believe that direct or person-to-person selling works due to the trust factor, which makes it easier in building a community.”“We have a lot of trust factors in our products and that’s why a lot of people come to our community centers or what we call nutrition clubs and they enjoy our products because they trust our products and they know it’s top quality,” Gratton added.He realized as well that families in many communities, especially in the low-income ones, tend to prioritize putting food on the table rather than taking care of the health of the family, or the concept of being reactive rather than preventive.However, he noted that even though people in most communities tend to be reactionary in nature or are more of “in the moment” when it comes to health, they can simply take any of the Herbalife products like the Herbalife shakes, which has all the necessary nutrients, then they are already able to provide all the nutrition that the body needs, whether members of the community have a reactive or preventive concept to health.WITH regards to Herbalife’s evolution down the line, Gratton said he did not understand at first the effects of the pandemic on young men and women, especially when a lot of applications or “apps” came out that dealt specifically with mental health during the pandemic. He noted that studies have shown that men are more prone to states of depression or anxiety and will not speak to other men about it for fear that they may be perceived as weak, compared to women who are more open to talk about it with other women, their relatives or the community.Realizing this, it has become a big part of their digital approach that they are building right now. For the last year, the company has been involved in a whole digital platform that is shifting. Admittedly, he said that Herbalife is more high touch but low tech for the past 40 years since their approach was more personal, but they realized that they can’t compete like that anymore so now they have a whole new digital platform and through this, they hope to address many of the health concerns of the younger people in the community.“We hope to reach out to these folks who are not too keen to attend personal meetings. We’ve done this in Singapore and a few other countries, and we hope to bring it to the Philippines soon, where the young distributors here can talk to the older set in the community on their phone and discuss good health and nutrition tips, all from the comforts of their homes. That’s the dream, and we hope that’s what this digital platform will provide.”"

If inventions and creations are not patented, “it belongs now to the public domain where anyone can reproduce or manufacture it,” Atty. Josephine R. Santiago of the University of the Philippines Diliman College of Law said at the 7th session of the iStories webinar, hosted by the University of the Philippines-Diliman College of Science. Atty. Santiago is an award-winning intellectual property (IP) expert who served as the Director General of the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL).According to Harvey L. Sapigao, research associate, Blue Marble Institute, Institute of Science, University of the Philippines, Baguio, patenting proved vital and beneficial to Filipino scientists in the long run for their research work.DR. Neila Cortes-Maramba of UP Manila led a team of scientists in the 1990s to investigate ten medicinal plants in the Philippines. Two of these plants exhibited promising results: one for cough and the other for urinary tract infections. The team patented Vitex negundo (Lagundi) and Blumea balsamifera (Sambong) in syrup and tablet forms, granting them exclusive rights to these medicines. “Today, Lagundi and Sambong are essential remedies for coughs and UTIs, proving lucrative for the pharmaceutical industry. Had they not applied for a patent, UP Manila and its partners would not have earned more than P50 million in remittances through royalties and licensing fees. They would not be able to claim the invention as their own and would leave it vulnerable to theft,” said Sapigao in his essay.A patent, as a form of IP, provides the inventor exclusive rights to their creations. “The right of a patentee is only to prevent third persons from manufacturing, offering for sale, using, selling, or importing the invention,” Santiago explained. “It is not to make the invention, but to prevent others.” She added that, when multiple inventors unknowingly created the same invention, the first to file the patent secures the rights to it.SAPIGAO pointed out that UP Diliman has successfully patented various inventions, such as CoaTiN, a coating technology that uses titanium nitride to extend the lifespan of metallic tools, developed by Dr. Henry Ramos of the National Institute of Physics (NIP), and an amebiasis detection kit that quickly identifies the disease using saliva, invented by Dr. Windell Rivera, Dr. Angeline Odelia Concepcion, and Dr. Alexander Edward Dy of the Institute of Biology (IB).Patents not only benefit inventors but also stimulate innovation and improve existing products. Applying for patents requires detailed explanations of how the invention works. This information becomes publicly available upon patent approval, allowing other inventors to draw inspiration from or enhance the patented work.In the forum, Santiago also discussed the other three types of IP: trademarks, which protect identifying symbols and expressions; copyright which grants rights from the moment of creation; and trade secrets, which safeguards valuable confidential information.Rizal Raoul S.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/01/11/with-dementia-preventing-it-is-better-than-curing-it/,"With dementia, preventing it is better than curing it","AROUND the world, there are about 10 million new cases of dementia that emerge annually, making it a global healthcare problem that affects a person’s memory. It is also one of the major causes of disability among the elderly, which puts this debilitating disease as the seventh leading cause of death globally.Aside from those who have it, the disease also creates a significant impact on the lives of those who provide dementia-stricken people with care.In the Philippines, around 220,632 new cases of dementia are projected by 2030, which necessitated the call for more attention to this illness.ACCORDING to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, dementia “is not a specific disease but a general term for the impaired ability to think, remember, or make decisions that interferes with doing everyday activities.”It affects people, particularly those who are at least 65 years old. Contrary to popular belief, CDC said dementia is not a part of the normal aging process because there are many older adults who live long lives without suffering from it.Among dementia’s common symptoms, the CDC said, may include those related to memory, attention, communication, judgment or reasoning and problem solving, even visual perception. These symptoms may vary among people.In terms of signs that point to dementia, the CDC includes getting lost in a familiar place or neighborhood, the use of unusual words when referring to certain objects, unable to recall certain moments in life or complete certain tasks. The thing that most people dread about dementia is the inability to recall the names of family members, close relatives, or friends.These signs are commonly related to Alzheimer’s disease, which is a common cause of dementia, and accounts for about 60 to 80 percent of all cases, the CDC pointed out. Other types of dementia are vascular dementia, lewy body dementia, fronto temporal dementia, and mixed dementia.Unfortunately, there is no treatment or cure yet for dementia, though certain medications can help protect the brain or manage the symptoms, the CDC said. Leading a healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, healthy eating, and keeping social contacts may help reduce the number of people with dementia while extensive research on the development of certain treatment options is all ongoing.JUST recently, a healthcare company, HI-Eisai Pharmaceutical, Inc., a subsidiary of the Eisai Group, partnered with the Yuchengco Group of Companies and together with Purple Angel, a global dementia awareness group, launched “Gunita para sa Dementia,” an initiative that aims to unite stakeholders to improve the lives of Filipino patients with dementia and their caregivers.The launch event titled “Cure and Care: The Future Perspective of Dementia,” highlighted the initiative’s mission to raise awareness among different stakeholders about dementia.According to HI-Eisai Medical Director Dr. Godfrey Robeniol, of utter importance in the fight against dementia is stakeholder collaboration to support dementia patients and their caregivers. “Integrating HI-Eisai’s philosophy of human health care into its goal, Gunita para sa Dementia is about cherishing memories and promoting understanding. The word ‘gunita’ itself, which is the Tagalog word for ‘memories,’ embodies the essence of this initiative. It signifies the importance of preserving and valuing the memories of our loved ones, especially those living with dementia,” Dr. Robeniol said.For his part, Purple Angel founder Norman McNamara from Devon in the United Kingdom, who himself was diagnosed with dementia at only 50 years old, highlighted the importance of promoting dementia-friendly practices for better care and support.“Knowing that something can be done to support patients with dementia and their caregivers is half the battle. As we strive to raise awareness about dementia, we are paving the path toward a more compassionate future for all those impacted by the condition,” McNamara stated.Also discussed by speakers and specialists during the event were existing methodologies aimed at preventing and treating dementia, which include the use of music therapy to address the mental and emotional challenges associated with the condition.“Having a comprehensive understanding of dementia is a crucial step towards developing effective treatments. This understanding must encompass diverse perspectives because dementia is a complex syndrome that should be treated with an interdisciplinary approach,” explained geriatric psychiatry expert Dr. Profitasari Kusumaningrum from the Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia-Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, and one of the event’s speakers. “While there has been some progress, we are still far from finding a cure that will halt the progression of this disease.”She further emphasized that until such a cure is universally available, the key to combatting dementia is prevention, where people can take proactive steps towards prevention early on, starting with the individual self and the surroundings."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/01/09/celebrate-and-welcome-the-new-year-with-these-sustainable-habits/,Celebrate and welcome the New Year with these sustainable habits,"The holidays have come and gone but as we loved giving and receiving gifts, we also cannot help but think about how much waste we’ve made during this time. When we shop for presents and wrap them, we use and dispose of shopping bags, gift wrappers, ribbons, tape, plastic, and gift cards in the process. While we should enjoy the season of giving, we also should not forget that the trash that comes from it will impact the environment when not disposed of properly. The new year is the best time to be more conscious and build sustainable habits to be practiced moving forward. Leading Health, wellness, and beauty retailer Watsons has always espoused sustainability and responsible consumerism by offering its customers Sustainable Choices, products made with responsibly sourced ingredients that are good for you, and better packaging made with less virgin plastics. There are also refilling stations in two Watsons stores (SM Megamall and The Block at SM City North Edsa) where you can get refills for your favorite Naturals by Watsons products. Watsons encourages its customers to read labels, especially if they’re into Clean Beauty as the retailer carries many products in this category under Sustainable Choices. Watsons also encourages its customers to bring shopping bags instead of paper and plastic bags.“We at Watsons hope to promote more sustainable shopping habits to our dear customers when they do a lot of shopping. For starters, we have our Sustainable Choices, a wide range of health, wellness, and beauty products they can choose from with better packaging and cleaner ingredients, which can also be refilled at our Watsons refilling stations. We also encourage them to recycle Christmas wrappers and maybe use old ribbons and twine to tie their gifts instead of using tape. These are small steps we all can take for a greener future,” said Sharon Decapia, Senior AVP for Marketing, PR, and Sustainability, Watsons Philippines.If there is one thing that Watsons hopes for customers during the season of giving or as a New Year’s resolution is to help others through Watsons’ community-targeted initiatives. These charities include Operation Smile Philippines, which, in partnership with Watsons, has changed the lives of thousands of children born with cleft and lip palate. For this, Watsons has Give A Smile coin banks at cashiers of Watsons stores nationwide.Get started on these sustainable shopping habits when you visit your favorite Watsons branch to shop. Hopefully, these habits can be sustained beyond just the start of the year."

Its consumption amid the glut of flavored, unhealthy beverages out there should start at an early age. Thanks to Filinvest Land Inc. (FLI), a total of 1,800 students from Dumaguete City can now drink cleaner and safer water courtesy of its donated new water filtration system. This state-of-the-art technology is currently being used by South City Elementary School (SCES) in Barangay Mangnao, Dumaguete City that seeks to significantly improve the health and well-being of the school’s young learners. “This water filtration system is a testament to the collaborative efforts between FLI and the Barangay Mangnao as we engage the community to address critical needs. This timely donation stands as a beacon of hope for our local learners as we ensure access to clean and safe drinking water for SCES,” said John Paul Escario, area general manager for Visayas at FLI.Joining him at the recent turnover ceremony were Ramel Tayko, Barangay Mangnao captain; Ricardo Valencia, Barangay Mangnao councilor; and Phil Calumpang, FLI geographic planning head-rest of Visayas.The full-range property development unit of Filinvest Development Corp., which traces its roots to nearby Cebu province, has a strong presence in Dumaguete City, as it is the builder of Marina Town, a 1.9-hectare integrated township along Rizal Boulevard set to redefine the city’s progressive landscape. Located within Marina Town are Marina Spatial, a three-building mid-rise condo community; Marina Town Offices by Filinvest; and Marina Town Mall.DRINKING water is a vital part of everyone’s daily routine. Having consumed enough of it that is clean and safe brings manifold benefits to everybody, especially to young ones.Around 60 percent of the body is comprised of water. Because almost all of it is utilized to enable the body to function, drinking enough water helps replace what’s lost.Hydration affects the digestive system. The gut absorbs water from the poo, resulting to an inconvenient backlog. The only way to dislodge it is by rehydrating. Drink sufficient water for a smooth digestion and to bring bowel movements back to normal. Plasma comprises more than 50 percent of the blood. It brings blood cells around the body to where they’re needed, thus helping keep a healthy blood pressure and ensuring body temperature under control. Because plasma is about 90 percent water, it can function well if the body is hydrated. And that only happens by consuming enough water.Water is helpful for a change in eating habits. Drinking it prior to a meal will fill up the stomach a little. Eating at a moderate pace enables the brain time to catch up with the tummy. Hence, it leads to eating less and, in turn, some weight loss.Based on studies, poor hydration contributes to life-threatening health problems with the heart, lung, kidneys and bladder. Heat stroke can also be blamed to insufficient water consumption. Water also flushes out toxins with the help of kidneys. Not drinking enough of water causes kidneys to not function correctly.Like any other organs, the brain also needs water. Some research have even shown that dehydration can cause the brain cells to shrink a bit, leaving it less effective than it would normally be. Because of this, anyone who doesn’t drink a lot of water finds it hard to concentrate and solve problems longer. The extra brain strain can also result to irritability. So a glass of water can be of help to improve the mood, especially when studying.Roderick L.

Lingad Memorial General Hospital in San Fernando City, Pampanga province opened to Central Luzon residents who need interventional cardiac and non-cardiac procedures under interventional radiology.It was completed in 120 days through the Health Facilities Enhancement Program and in coordination with provincial and local government units.Its funding was taken out of the P1-billion budget given to the hospital in 2013 for the provision of equipment and buildings.Apart from cardiac procedures, the CathLab currently serves patients in the region who have different medical needs.Meantime, the DOH launched the construction of the Clark Multi Specialty Medical Center on July 17 in collaboration with the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, the Clark Development Corporation, Pampanga local government units, and in partnership with the private sector like the Bloomberry Cultural Foundation, Inc.Specialized departments, including heart, kidney, cancer, and pediatrics, are expected to open in the soon-to-rise medical center.To ensure the facilities in the Eastern Visayas, Health Secretary Ted Herbosa visited Biliran Provincial Hospital (BPH), DOH-Treatment and Rehabilitation Center-Dulag, Eastern Visayas Medical Center, and the Gov. Benjamin T. Romualdez General Hospital and Schistosomiasis Center on October 26 and 27.Herbosa checked on the construction of new facilities in some of these hospitals and their best practices, innovations, and operational challenges.He also gave them instructions on how to improve strategies in maintaining the quality of service delivery.FOR the benefit of the marginalized population, the DOH launched the “Libreng Laboratoryo, Konsulta, at Gamot Para sa Lahat” (Lab for All) caravan in Santa Cruz town, Laguna province on June 27.The caravan, a project of First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos, aims to provide free consultation, free x-ray, laboratory services and medicines to the provinces.Previous “Lab for All” caravans were held every Tuesday in cities in the provinces of Batangas, Tarlac, and Pampanga, and in Baguio City.THE DOH also pushed for the creation of a council that will serve as a governing body which will oversee the implementation of the Universal Health Care (UHC) law, the estimated total of the national cost for the UHC, and the implementation of UHC at the local government level.President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. had approved the plan last October.Herbosa said the DOH will chair the council with the Department of the Interior and Local Government as its co-chair.“The council will police or monitor how LGUs or local health systems would be spending funds, income from PhilHealth, and how the other systems can be improved,” he said.The member agencies of the council include the Department of Information and Communications Technology, Department of Budget and Management, Department of Finance, Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, Philippine Regulation Commission, National Economic and Development Authority, Technical Education and Skills Development Authority, Commission on Higher Education and Department of Education.Since 2021, Herbosa reported that 71 LGUs have committed to integrate their local health systems. These were labeled as UHC Integration Sites which consist of 59 provinces and 12 highly-urbanized cities.He added that the DOH has already engaged five UHC Integration Sites to become primary care provider network sandbox or trials or pilots and these are Baguio, Bataan, Quezon, Guimaras and South Cotabato as for 2023.2024 PrioritiesHERBOSA told the Philippine News Agency on Monday that health officials are drafting the plan to modernize the DOH—a measure that would address inequity in the provision of primary health-care services among Filipinos.“We will build ambulatory primary care centers complete with laboratories, medicines, and imaging so that people need not flock to big hospitals,” he said.The creation of a national ambulatory and urgent care centers nationwide will ensure that the poor receives the same healthcare services much like individuals who go to modern hospitals, he added.For 2024, the DOH also aims to increase the immunization coverage of children under five years old to 95 percent; lower stunting or under nutrition rate among young children from the current 27 percent to 14 percent; reduce maternal mortality deaths and teenage pregnancy; lower cases of tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus; and decrease cases of non-communicable diseases like hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer.“Also, road safety, the number of deaths is increasing due to accidents involving motorcycles because more people are learning to drive them,” Herbosa said."

With innumerable facilities around the country that offer wellness services such as yoga, detoxification, and even ethnic massage forms like the traditional “hilot” that allow people to heal and recuperate, especially when coming after a medical procedure, many tourists have often wondered why they didn’t discover the Philippines much earlier.This is the reason why the present administration is hell-bent in making the Philippines a top medical and health and wellness tourism destination, a globally marketable product that caters to a wide array of tourists, not just in Asia but in many parts of the world.ACCORDING to the Global Wellness Economy: Country Rankings released by the Global Wellness Institute, the global wellness economy was valued at US$4.9 trillion in 2019, though it slowed to US$4.4 trillion in 2020 due to the pandemic. It rebounded last year with US$5.6 trillion in value and is seen to track an upward trajectory by an average of 9.9 percent per year and reach about US$7 trillion next year.In terms of Wellness Economy Size and Ranking, the Philippines was ranked 25th with a US$29.2 billion value in 2017. This grew, however, in 2020, to US$33 billion, and placed the country at a respectable 21st to beat other top health and wellness tourism destinations in the ASEAN region such as Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos. These results further cemented the prospect that the country can compete strongly to become among the top wellness economy markets, if given strong public and private sector support.This is the reason why last year, the Department of Tourism (DOT) partnered with the Agora Group, a global medical and wellness industry leader based in Dubai, in the holding of the First International Health and Wellness Tourism Congress (IHWTC) 2023 in Dusseldorf, Germany, a prestigious and high-level event that gathered tourism stakeholders and medical professionals, and help position the country as an emerging medical and wellness tourism haven in Asia.“We are giving the Philippines a fighting chance at becoming a tourism powerhouse in Asia. And we recognize that medical tourism and wellness tourism hold one of the keys to this endeavor, because we have the people, we have the facilities, and we are adjusting government policies to ensure that the climate for medical tourism to thrive will ensue,” according to Tourism Secretary Ma. Esperanza Christina Garcia Frasco.AS part of the country’s seriousness in helping make the Philippines a top medical, health and wellness hub, a group headed by the country’s acknowledged wellness guru, Cory Quirino, as its Executive Director, will hold an event dubbed “Health and Wellness CONFEX 2024.”This three-day event, happening from January 26 to 28, 2024, at the SMX Convention Center at the Mall of Asia Complex in Pasay City, will gather various stakeholders of the multi trillion-dollar health and wellness industry such as wellness resorts, globally renowned and accredited hospitals that provide medical tourism packages, even organic farms and specialty shops that offer innovative, sustainable and eco-friendly health and wellness products and services.It will also promote “regenerative tourism,” an advocacy to make the places that tourists visit become better compared to when it was originally discovered and pursue economic growth while managing the social and environmental impact of each visit.The event, which carries the theme “Go & Get Better,” is the centerpiece of a global multi-media campaign that will showcase the country’s many health and wellness destinations, plus an exhibit, a conference, business matching sessions, and various experiential activities. It is considered the only trade fair in the Philippines that promotes health and wellness tourism, products and services, and exclusively focused on sustainable wellness and lifestyle products and services.Co-presented by the Department of Tourism (DOT), the Department of Health (DOH), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA), Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA), Duty Free Philippines (DFP), and Tourism Promotions Board (TPB), CONFEX 2024 will also be the venue in the launching of a television travel show-vlog called “OTW” or “On Travel & Wellness” where viewers can explore the fascinating world of health and wellness amid the breathtaking natural wonders of the Philippines. There will also be a Wellness Festival called Masigabo, which will pay tribute to the industry and sacrifices of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) through activities designed to make them feel better, relaxed and loved. Health and wellness experts will also deliver talks about financial health, physical wellness, beauty, sustainability, environmental protection, government regulations, among others."

Marcos Jr. always says no Filipino should be deprived of quality health care. That’s why we continuously give high regard to our health care facilities, more importantly, our specialty hospitals like NKTI,” she said.The NKTI is the center for the referral of kidney patients from various regional hospitals in the country and is recognized as the lead agency in voluntary blood services. In its 33-year existence and operations, the Institute’s medical achievements and milestones are comparable to any specialty hospital in the world.The NKTI, formerly known as the National Kidney Foundation of the Philippines (NKFP), serves as the center for referral of kidney patients from various regional hospitals in the country and is recognized as the lead agency in voluntary blood services.Located along East Avenue in Quezon City, the NKTI is a 2-story structure with three buildings (Main, Annex and Dialysis Center) connected.The Main Building houses most of the Cost Centers and the Administrative offices, while the Annex Building encloses the recently opened Marcos Wing and the Radiology Department, Center for Special Services and the Emergency Department.The Out-Patient Department, Hemodialysis and CAPD centers, HOPE office, Medical Records office and the clinics of all its Medical Specialists can be found in the Dialysis Center."

The Institute offers preventive health check packages that are customized and personalized to meet the patient’s needs.TMC is taking healthcare checks to the next level with the introduction of The Wellness Longevity Program. Described as “a symphony of cutting-edge medical science and research,” the program weaves together precision medicine, lifestyle interventions and proactive health strategies to craft a treatment approach.“When we take a look at the patient profiles of our returning patients, we do have a lot of patients who come in every year for several years, carrying the same risks and problems despite our advice on lifestyle management. They don’t get a better dashboard. Some of them get sick actually,” noted Dr. Christian Flores, WAI Director.This was a trigger for Dr. Flores and his team to come up with a better dashboard, “a better tool that will give a better analysis of where a patient is in terms of his health.”“The important point here is that instead of waiting for someone to get sick and have his life at risk and if he survives that, he might have some disability. We want to preempt it earlier. Before, we used conventional tests but now we have a better tool to evaluate. It is personalized and unique for that individual in terms of food, medication and type of exercise, for example,” he said.Dr. Raul Destura, Director of TMC’s Clinical and Translational Research Institute, explained this further by describing The Longevity Program as a “well-curated set of technology platforms where scientific evidence is attached to everything to make sure that what we are doing is actually based on science.”“Each of these platforms have actually been pre-validated by top universities all over the world, condensing them into a precision technology suite that can actually be accessed by our patients here at WAI. It’s something about empowering an individual to be able to know how to live his life once he gets information about himself, on how his gene interprets and interacts with the environment,” he said.Through Precision Medicine, which delivers the right treatment for the right patient at the right time, experts can unlock the potential of the patient’s DNA to tailor patient healthcare. This will help them make medical decisions that truly align with each individual’s needs. Under the umbrella of precision medicine are biological age testing, pharmacogenomics and nutrigenics.Biological age testing unveils the secrets of a patient’s inner body workings. The test will review the patient’s unique body rhythm, encouraging choices that are in sync with the patient’s biological essence. This test is the key to unlocking “a vibrant, energized and resilient life.”Pharmacogenomics, on the other hand, is a field of medicine that investigates how a person’s genetic makeup may affect how their body processes certain medications. In involves genetic testing that looks for changes in specific genes. the study of how genes after a person’s response to drugs. This can help doctors to prescribe a medication that leads to fewer side effects or that may work better for the patient.Nutrigenetics studies the relationship between genes and diet with the aim of achieving optimal health through diet. It is the science the bridges the gap between the food you consume and your distinct genetic makeup. Genetic variations determine the body’s nutrient response, influencing crucial lifestyle factors like physical function, cognitive performance and overall well-being.Under the expert guidance of TMC-WAI, this program not only incorporates lifestyle interventions but also encourages patients to embrace preventive health-seeking behaviors, ensuring a holistic approach to fostering a longer and healthier life.Dr. Kathrina Bundalian, a Lifestyle Medicine specialist and Head of the Preventive Health Section at WAI, emphasized that “making positive choices in lifestyle, such as getting good sleep, staying connected, and keeping an active lifestyle, along with taking preventive steps like regular check-ups, adds an extra layer, boosting the chances of a longer health span.”"

According to the Department of Health, one in four children aged five and below are short for their age or stunted. Abbott is increasing awareness and working together with mom celebrities and communities to tackle stunting among children in the Philippines.Abbott’s Growth Watch initiative shines a light on childhood stunting, a form of malnutrition. It aims to empower parents to screen for and recognize stunting in their children so that they can improve their children’s nutrition, if needed.Stunting can challenge a child’s development, impact their overall health and limit their future potential. Children affected by stunting can be at risk of significant immune deficiencies, compromised cognitive function, behavioral problems, diminished bone health, and decreased muscle mass. The Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition 2023-2028 identified poor feeding practices and low nutrition literacy among the causes of malnutrition in the country. Additionally, two in three Filipino moms don’t recognize stunting as an important child development issue.“There is a clear need to educate parents on the prevalence and impact of childhood stunting on growth and development,” explains Dr. Jose Dimaano Jr., nutrition medical affairs director for Abbott in Pacific Asia. “Early identification of growth issues and quick intervention for children found to be at risk of nutrition deficiency can have a profound impact on the fight against stunting. This is why Abbott is taking a multidisciplinary approach in supporting parents by working with communities and healthcare practitioners to provide tools and information to spot the signs of malnutrition and take action.”In collaborating with celebrity moms Chesca Kramer, Nadine Samonte, Divine Lee, Nina Corpuz, influencers and online mom communities, Abbott intends to increase awareness of stunting and support parents with tools and educational resources that can help children reach their full growth potential.‘’Since its inception in 2021, Growth Watch has educated and reached more than 161,000 families, and the goal is to double the reach by the end of next year,’’ said Angelico Escobar, general manager of Abbott’s nutrition business in the Philippines.‘’Abbott is driven by our mission to help children have a healthy start and reach their optimal growth. We know that malnutrition is complex and affects children’s growth across all socioeconomic classes. The work of Growth Watch is one of Abbott’s efforts to fight global malnutrition and to help children achieve their growth potential through measurement and proper nutrition,” Escobar added.In 2021, Abbott launched the Abbott Center for Malnutrition Solutions, an initiative to reduce malnutrition. The center, a collaboration between Abbott and external experts and partners, is focused on the identification, treatment and prevention of malnutrition for the most vulnerable populations in the world including children, aging adults and under-resourced populations. The Growth Watch initiative also contributes toward Abbott’s 2030 Sustainability Plan goal to transform care for malnutrition, chronic and infectious diseases.Habit of measuringAs part of the Growth Watch initiative, parents and guardians are invited to join mom communities to establish the habit of measuring their children’s height, and provide proper nutrition to safeguard the growth, well-being and development of children across the country.Nutrition plays a crucial role in addressing malnutrition and stunting challenges. Addressing undernutrition early can help mitigate growth issues and ensure children reach their full developmental capacity. For children who do not get enough nutrients through food alone, nutrition supplements, such as PediaSure Plus, can help fill some of the gaps.

Our fellowmen must be able to feel their benefits from PhilHealth,” he added.The state health insurer first implemented the case rate payment system in 2013, where it reimbursed a fixed amount for a specific medical condition or surgical case.With the set adjustment, the case rates are likely to increase to a maximum of 30 percent across all cases, resulting to lower out-of-pocket expenses during hospitalization and even during outpatient care.To minimize untoward inflationary effects after rate adjustments, PhilHealth will prescribe a cost-sharing mechanism where health facilities and the members will have fixed co-payment rates on top of what is being paid for by PhilHealth.This way, health facilities will be more efficient in the use of resources to achieve desired health outcomes while members can predict how much they should pay for amenities and other extra services availed of beyond those provided in basic or ward accommodations.Other strategies to control the untoward effects of this adjustment include measures to prevent insurance fraud and doctor moral hazard.“This will be our way of controlling healthcare costs, in making member’s expenses predictable, and in discouraging irrational use of healthcare services among facilities,” Ledesma said.PhilHealth shall adopt a variable inflation adjustment across types of health facilities, which means that higher-level facilities shall get higher adjustments in rates up to a maximum of 30 percent.Ledesma said the upward adjustment in case rates is on top of the ongoing benefit expansion and rationalization that was already approved by the PhilHealth Board.For 2023, PhilHealth has implemented the expansion of dialysis coverage to 156 sessions from the previous 90 sessions and rationalized the rates for conditions mostly availed of among Filipinos.Through Circular 2023-0021, it increased the coverage for ischemic stroke from P28,000 to P76,000, and hemorrhagic stroke from P38,000 to P80,000.It is set to release a circular before yearend to widen its coverage for pneumonia high-risk from PHP32,000 to PHP90,100.In 2024, Z Benefits for breast cancer shall likewise be expanded, which will include coverage of targeted therapy of up to P1 million per patient per year.Z Benefits cover 20 catastrophic illnesses and health conditions requiring expensive treatments and hospitalizations: acute lymphocytic leukemia, early breast cancer, prostate cancer, kidney transplant, standard risk coronary bypass graft, tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defect, cervical cancer, Z MORPH (Mobility, Orthosis, Rehabilitation and Prosthesis Help), selected orthopedic implants, peritoneal dialysis, colon cancer, rectal cancer, expanded mobility orthosis rehabilitation help, premature and small newborns, children with developmental disabilities, children with mobility impairment, children with visual impairment, children with hearing impairment, and rheumatic heart disease."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/12/28/up-researchers-caution-against-parasites-in-raw-vegetables-seafood/,"UP researchers caution against parasites in raw vegetables, seafood","Scientists from the University of the Philippines (UP) are gently reminding the public to thoroughly wash and cook their market-bought fresh produce and seafood as a precautionary measure against parasites.The parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, called Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), is one of the most infectious parasites in the world. It affects almost a third of the world’s population, most especially vulnerable groups such as the pregnant and immunocompromised. While most people infected with the disease do not present any symptoms, some may suffer flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, and muscle aches. But in severe cases, toxoplasmosis can cause inflammation of the brain and blurry vision. Infected parents’ newborn infants may suffer from excessive fluid in the brain and developmental issues. Fortunately, treatments are available for toxoplasmosis, hence symptomatic individuals are advised to seek timely medical attention.Cielo Emar M. Paraoan, Ren Mark D. Villanueva, and Marie Christine M. Obusan of the UP Diliman College of Science’s Institute of Biology (UPD-CS IB) found that T. gondii is fairly common in vegetables and oysters that they sampled from local markets in Central Luzon. Among the vegetables tested were lettuce, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, and mung bean sprouts.Six out of 60 or 10 percent collected vegetable samples contained traces of T. gondii, with leafy vegetables found to be more contaminated than root vegetables. Similarly, for oysters, 9.09 percent or four out of 44 samples were also contaminated. The researchers noted that the T. gondii traces found on both vegetables and oysters are of Type I genotype. The researchers aim to investigate further the genotypes of T. gondii that will be detected in the country, as Asia is reported to have a high degree of genetic diversity.The study provides evidence that T. gondii may be transmitted through vegetables and oysters that are being sold in supermarkets and public markets. However, the researchers noted that they only tested a small sample size, and more studies with bigger sample sizes must be conducted. At present, they have an ongoing study that detects the parasite in environmental samples.The study also underscores the importance of adequately preparing fresh produce and seafood to eliminate not just T. gondii but also other parasites that may be present. The authors also emphasized the need for better management of biological pollutants.“The most sustainable approach for reducing the risk of T. gondii exposure through the consumption of seafood should focus on reducing T. gondii contamination at its source, as well as mitigating the flow of contaminated runoff to water bodies,” the authors said in their paper, published in the October 2023 issue of the Philippine Journal of Science."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/12/28/dr-abigail-san-pedro-garcia-a-dermatologist-for-marginalized-women/,Dr. Angeli San Pedro-Garcia: A dermatologist for marginalized women,"There’s one dermatologist who is determined to empower marginalized women and that’s Dr. Angeli San Pedro-Garcia, the CEO of Derma Circles.Dr. Angeli San Pedro-Garcia, the chief executive officer of Derma Circles, is one healthcare practitioner who has also included empowering women in her community to uplift their own lives in her own little way. According to San Pedro-Garcia, Derma Circles’ mission is to provide inexpensive aesthetic and dermatology services backed by scientifically based treatment procedures and therapies. The clinic also aims to employ marginalized women and giving them decent and respectable jobs so they can improve their lives.“I hired marginalized women from the very start. I witnessed the struggles of my mother as a single parent and it compelled me to help disadvantaged women, especially single mothers. I would personally train them for about a month not just on dermatological care but also on dealing with people and on cross selling our services,” she said.“I would observe if they’ve acquired the necessary skills before I make them permanent employees. I’m very frank but I’m also careful not to offend people. If I have to let go of people, I explain to them that I have a standard to maintain,” she added.San Pedro-Garcia has a burning desire to offer inexpensive professional dermatological services to classes B, C and D to reduce the practice of people turning to pseudo-dermatologists. Her clinic’s unique selling proposition has always been effective dermatological treatment and care or skin improvement because of expertise and well-researched medicines.For her, clients are not hard to come by because they know Derma Circles provides excellent results, including healing from the damage caused by pseudo-dermatologists.“My staff are well-trained and are aware that it is safe to dispense any of our skincare products or combinations of these,” she said.San Pedro-Garcia did not initially plan to be a dermatologist. The turning point came when a dermatologist friend of hers suggested that she specialize in dermatology so that she would not be pressured by her studies. This would also enable her to personally take care of her son.Moreover, she started to develop an admiration for dermatologists because of their ability to boost the confidence of the people. On a personal level, her mother’s visit to the dermatological clinic to treat her severe acne gave her a closer view of how a dermatologist can make a difference in an individual’s life.San Pedro-Garcia started her entrepreneurial journey at the young age of nine doing menial work in their family business of gasoline refilling stations. She then ventured into buying and selling candies which were popular with her classmates.Later on San Pedro-Garcia helped in another family business, a 24-hour drugstore in Surigao City. She and her siblings were expected to man the store during the weekends and after school. Being the eldest of four children, she was tasked to purchase supplies and monitoring sales. This was the start of her vision of having a business of her own.After graduating from Far Eastern University-Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation (FEU-NRMF) medical school in 1991, she later earned her specialization at the Jose Reyes Memorial Medical Center. She became a board-certified dermatologist in 1996.In 1998, she joined the first Healthway multi-specialty clinic in SM North EDSA. She worked for six years for Healthway, initially as a general practitioner and later as a full-fledged dermatologist.Healthway opened San Pedro-Garcia’s eyes to the possibility of having her own clinic that offers reliable, convenient and affordable dermatological treatment and care to people beyond the usual affluent patients.In 2004, she opened her own clinic in a building on J.C. Aquino Avenue in Butuan City. With two facialists and five beds, San Pedro-Garcia would provide dermatological services to people from all walks of life. From the onset, she would hire marginalized women.“I was confident to have my own clinic because I’m a board-certified dermatologist. Aside from that I know that I’m a people person. When I worked for Healthway, patients would prefer me over other dermatologists so I thought I was doing an effective job. I also built contacts with suppliers of medical equipment and supplies,” San Pedro-Garcia said.“All these plus the experience I had in managing our family drugstore contributed to a fast-learning experience in running my own business,” she added.“I established my first clinic with P1.5 million. I spent it mostly on purchasing medical equipment from reputable companies because I wanted only the best for my customers. Thankfully, the rent for my first clinic wasn’t expensive,” she pointed out.Now, she has Re-Enhance Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery Clinic in Robinsons Place Butuan and Papa’s Building in San Francisco, Agusan del Norte; and Derma Circles in SM City Butuan. San Pedro’s Derma Circles has started seeking franchisees to expand its footprint.In the recently held Franchise Asia Philippines 2023, a one-stop exhibit for homegrown and international brands in the food, retail and service sectors held last month in SMX Mall of Asia, Derma Circles was the lone franchise from Butuan City.San Pedro-Garcia’s goal has always been to professionalize the practice of dermatology. Her mission is to provide a safe way to provide skincare. “To promote my vision and spread my mission, I decided to franchise Derma Circles,” she pointed out. To start the ball rolling, she consulted Francorp, a leading franchise consulting company, and encouraged her to pursue her lofty goal.“I had the right training and education: four years in medical school, passing the physician licensure board exam, another three years for specialization training on dermatology and its subspecialty cosmetic dermatology, and passing the diplomate board exam under the Philippine Dermatological Society. I keep abreast of trends by attending annual conferences on dermatology here and abroad,” she pointed out.There are two things that motivate San Pedro-Garcia to grow Derma Circles: the ability to make people feel good about themselves as well as the ability to empower the disadvantaged by giving them employment and hope.“I plan to start with a franchisee or two, preferably in Mindanao, to focus on ensuring their business success. Once we’ve proven that our franchising model leads to profitable business, it will be easy to scale and expand to different parts of the country,” she said.Although profit is the growth driver of any business, Derma Circles is focused on its mission of making people look and feel good by providing quality and personalized services and customer experience with excellent results. San Pedro-Garcia said the staff or technicians are encouraged to cross-sell their products and services but never compromise the welfare of the client for the sake of sales. “We make sure that we apply integrity in the workplace for our clients to trust us,” she said.“It is my goal to democratize dermatological treatment and care so that people are not forced to resort to cheap services and products that entail high risks to their skin’s health. An equally important part of our mission is providing jobs to women who are not given many opportunities for a job,” she added.Rizal Raoul S. Reyes has covered technology, science, business, property and special reports. He had working stints with the Business Star, Manila Bulletin and Independent Daily News."

Cruz, Laguna and in Baguio City respectively.At the site of the once tumbledown and gloomy health center in Sta. Cruz, Laguna now stands a polished health center with its cheerful and comforting atmosphere. The transformation was made possible by SM Foundation as part of its commitment to help the government ensure adequate health services to residents at the barangay level.The health facility, Sta. Cruz Rural Health Unit, is the 200th health center refurbished and renovated by SM Foundation.According to SM Foundation Senior Project Manager Albert Uy, the health center had to be completely renovated with the replacement of its parts: from the roof, ceiling, walls, down to the floor. It is a PWD friendly facility with special toilets and ramps specially made for them.The interior was re-designed and a new layout was followed for more efficiency in delivering health services. Like other SM Foundation-renovated health centers, LED lights, inverter air-conditioning units and a rain catchment system were installed with special faucets in toilets as sustainability solutions while paints used were environment-friendly.To ensure the comfort of waiting patients, SM Foundation equipped the center with new furniture and fixtures, a play cabinet for young patients, and a breastfeeding room for nursing mothers. An added feature of the health center was the provision of a pharmacy with SM Foundation donating basic and essential medicines.The health center was turned over by SM Foundation Executive Director for Health and Medical Programs Connie Angeles to the municipality of Sta. Cruz local government led by Mayor Edgar San Luis who expressed his gratitude to SM Foundation.Dr. Elmina De Luna Monteza, Municipal Health Officer of Sta. Cruz, shared that the health center is manned by two full-time doctors, eight full-time nurses, 28 midwives, two doctors from the Mayor’s office and six sanitary officers.These medical and healthcare professionals are responsible for dispensing health services to the constituents. These include child health program (immunization and newborn screening), nutrition health program, oral health program, adolescent and youth health program, maternal health program, reproductive health program, infectious disease prevention and control, healthy lifestyle and smoking cessation program, disaster risk reduction management for health, epidemiology and surveillance, among others.Meanwhile, SM Foundation gifted Baguio City with a newly renovated and refurbished Lucban Health Center. It was turned over by Angeles to Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong.The 2-storey Lucban Health Center located in Brgy. Teodora Alonzo with a total population of 38,000 is the 201st wellness center rehabilitated by SM Foundation. It serves an average of 20 to 30 patients daily.It is one among the 16 health centers in Baguio City. Health officials of Baguio welcomed the renovation undertaken by SM Foundation. Dr. Ma. Lourdes Pakoy, Acting Assistant City Health Officer and Medical Officer of the Lucban Health Center said the repair and renovation done by SM Foundation has provided a comforting atmosphere for the patients and has given them the privacy when seeking consultation and treatment.“There is now a clear delineation of work areas” and activities can be planned with enough space even if these are scheduled simultaneously, she added."

In the Philippines, there are approximately 12 million people living with migraine. Migraine disproportionately affects women, occurring two to three times more in females than in males.Migraine is characterized by debilitating attacks lasting four to 72 hours with multiple symptoms, including pulsating headaches of moderate to severe pain intensity that can be associated with nausea or vomiting, and/or sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) and sensitivity to light (photophobia).“We at Pfizer take pride in bringing our breakthrough anti-migraine treatment in the country today as we believe migraine is not just a headache but a chronic, painful disorder that takes away many days and hours that are supposed to be spent in meaningful and productive engagements. Migraine is associated with significant impact on daily living, such as work and personal activities. Based on an article published at the Journal of Headache and Pain by Haw, et al 2020 migraine poses a significant threat to work productivity in the country,” said So-Myung Lim, Pfizer Philippines Country Manager.Results from the Phase 3 study published in Lancet demonstrated that a single dose of Rimegepant provided superior pain reduction and associated symptoms of migraine at two hours compared to placebo. The prevention study, also published in Lancet, demonstrated that Rimegepant taken every other day provided superior reduction in the number of days per month with migraine in Weeks 9 to 12 of the 12-week treatment period compared to placebo, that was maintained with continued dosing during the 12-month open-label extension period.“Believe it or not, headaches are disabling! Migraine affects people in the most productive years and unable to fully enjoy their lives. The launch of a novel anti-migraine treatment such as Rimegepant in the country can be a game-changer, especially for those with incapacitating attacks of migraine. This is indeed a welcome development that we hope can provide solutions to many of our patients.” said Dr. Artemio A. Roxas Jr., President of Philippine Headache Society.Rimegepant is approved in over 20 markets to date and is now available in the Philippines. Healthcare professionals will be able to decide how they want to prescribe Rimegepant based on the locally approved dosing."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/12/28/whats-best-for-brain-your-brain-matters/,What’s best for brain? Your brain matters,"What’s in this three-pound mass we all have at the top of our head that invites our curiosity and incites scientists to dig more knowledge into it?A lot, of course, are in this organ we call the brain. It is so complex that it controls our thought, memory, emotion, touch, movement, vision, breathing, hunger, temperature, and what we have that makes our body and soul intact. Together with the spinal cord that extends from it, medicine defines this function as the Central Nervous System or CNS.To deal with not just the great mystery but more so of the immense work involved in it, the Brain and Spine Institute of Cardinal Santos Medical Center was conceived two decades ago as a neurosurgical unit that, over time, has now evolved into a multi-specialty and comprehensive Institute.To understand how complex the Institute works, let us count the ways. Well, we deal with both adult and pediatric brain tumors, different types of stroke, movement disorders, diseases of the spine and the peripheral nervous system, memory problem, insomnia, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, and many more. Such conditions can be caused by genetic disorders, congenital abnormalities, infections, or lifestyle issues, among others.These are then broken down to as many types of patients and unique cases from as many varieties of the neuro-diseases. We may have refractory patients or those that do not respond to medications and are difficult to manage. We can have those patients who can be cured in a short span while there can be others whose conditions can be controlled long-term.Along with, and because of, this great length of tasks, the evolution of the Brain and Spine Institute happened so that it has now become a collaboration among multi-specialty experts that brought great strides and wonder in treating patients and improving outcomes.The collaboration and synergy afford us doctors with what we call our own checks and balances. For example, I have my own biases as a neurosurgeon since that was how I was taught and trained. However, when placed alongside the biases of other specialties, we achieve a more extensive insight into a certain condition.Experienced neurologists, neurosurgeons, orthopedic doctors, radiation oncologists, neuro pathologists, and neuro oncologists for both pediatrics and adult patients work hand in hand to come up with the best approach in treating or managing the patients.In Cardinal Santos, we have what we call a Tuesday Meeting among ourselves for the discussion of all the cases in our hands. We lay out our best chips to come out with a consensus not only for the treatment or management scheme but also to better educate the patients and their families. To stress this point, if I have taken out a tumor from a patient, for example, and presented it to the team, my neuropathologist will tell me what kind of tumor or grading tumor it is. Then, the other doctors can present their advice and solution based on the contexts of their specialty, training and experience. Then we come out with a formula that is presented to the patient and his family. Patients, especially their families, will generally never be comfortable with any treatment approach unless you educate them first.Alongside this teamwork, the availability of advanced technical and medical armaments at our disposal has also impacted treatment outcomes for the different types of neurological disorders, including malignant tumors.For example, we now have at Cardinal Santos the country’s only Philippine Gamma Knife Center that is a stereotactic radiosurgery unit for brain tumors. It gives a high dose of targeted radiation to the tumor without hitting the rest of the brain. It is a focal treatment that is not invasive and done on an outpatient basis. It is revolutionary and, has a reputed high efficiency rate of controlling the growth of a tumor that had extended the lives of so many patients for the past three decades.Yet, what exactly can people who think they are well and above brain disease do to best take care of their brain? The first thing is for them to be on their toes for any symptoms, especially those that can appear to be quite common like headaches, nausea, and vomiting. There can be pressure signs related to brain problems like the blurring of the vision, weakness or numbness of one side of the body, forms of seizure and epileptic attacks, or, movement disorders like incoordination or imbalance.While most of times these can be common episodes in our lives, we must note that there are cardinal manifestations that gives one a red flag to see a neurologist, a neurosurgeon or an allied specialist immediately. In a nutshell, the progressive nature of these symptoms whether headache, backpain, imbalance, seizure, or blurring of vision will be a clear indication for the need to see a doctor. To illustrate, when a headache, for example, leads into the blurring of your vision, or nausea or weakness in one side of your body, that is a clear sign of a brain problem and the best time to see a doctor.Let’s all mind our brain and let our lives continue to matter."

Galicia, endocrinologist and AWMB program director, said the center is dedicated to transforming lives through excellence in healthcare and with the help of a multidisciplinary team of medical specialists.“We understand the unique challenges of weight management and offer a comprehensive set of services to help you achieve your wellness goals,” she said, adding that a decrease in body weight delays the onset, lowers the risk, and prevents complications of diabetes.“It is not necessary to achieve the normal weight. Health and quality of life begin to improve even with modest weight loss,” Dr. Galicia said.The hospital’s Brain Attack Team recently received platinum status from the WSO (World Stroke Organization) Angels Awards.The WSO is committed to improve outcomes for stroke by ensuring that patients worldwide get access to stroke care that optimizes their survival. As part of this work, WSO has partnered with the Angels Initiative to increase the number of patients treated in stroke ready hospitals and to optimize the quality of treatment in all existing stroke centers.The WSO Angels Awards aims to provide practical support to improve stroke care globally, recognize and promote best practice in stroke care and share key leading around implementation of quality stroke care.Asian Hospital recently signed a memorandum agreement with the Medical Center Imus (MCI) for Asian Hospital’s Engagement and Alliance Linkage (HEAL) Program. Both hospitals share a common vision of providing the highest quality of care at a reasonable cost to their patients and the community.Asian Hospital was represented by its president and chief executive officer, Dr. Beaver Tamesis, while MCI is represented by its deputy chief executive officer, Dra. Jo Eileen Suzanne Ringler-Pama during the MOA signing.Asian Hospital observed World AIDS Day last December 1 by offering free HIV Rapid Testing at the General Medicine Clinic.Dr. Joseph Adrian Buensalido, an infectious disease specialist, said the hospital, through the General Medicine Clinic, offers hope and compassionate care to people living with HIV.“Our expert team of doctors is committed to providing life-saving treatment and ensuring that all eligible patients have access to free HIV medications. We understand the financial burden of healthcare and in collaboration with the Department of Health, we offer free medications to all our patients regardless of their circumstances,” he said.Dr. Buensalido added that everyone deserves to take control of their health and future and that the clinic will empower patients to do so.“We are here to make a difference. Let us remember those we have lost and commit to empowering lives and defeating HIV by getting free HIV Rapid Testing at General Medicine Clinic,” he said.Asian Hospital’s Clinical Nutrition Services was recognized as best-in-class in Quality Improvement Programs to improve health outcomes of patients with Malnutrition Risk.The Clinical Nutrition Services was recognized for its relentless drive, passion, and commitment to provide Quality Nutrition Management for all the hospital’s patients.The service was also acclaimed as a trailblazer in providing top notch training for registered nutritionists-dietitians in the Philippines. The team is an accredited provider of trainings for continuous professional development of registered nutritionists-dietitians in the country.The new and improved Blood Bank and Blood Donor Center opened last November 16, 2023, marking a momentous event for selflessness and community welfare.Attended by leaders and healthcare professionals, the inauguration highlighted a state-of-the-art facility dedicated to saving lives and fostering community unity.“The center is not just a structure, it’s a symbol of hope, health, and humanity, emphasizing the collective power of individuals to save lives through blood donation,” said Asian Hospital in a social media release."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/12/28/innovation-collaboration-shared-commitment-to-health-needed-vs-the-next-pandemic-phap/,"Innovation, collaboration, shared commitment to health needed vs the next pandemic—PHAP","REGARDLESS of economic and political stature, no country in the world was spared by the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, with varied effects on diverse sectors and industries.Countries closed their borders and imposed travel restrictions to prevent the virus from spreading further, which triggered a massive dip in economic performance even in major and powerful economies since trade was halted.Luckily, all that is in the past now as the global number of Covid-19 patients dropped dramatically. Countries have opened their borders for travel and tourism, international trade commenced once again, and everything, including people’s social activities went back to normal.DESPITE the challenges faced by the Philippines, a Third World country, during the pandemic, it never backed down from the fight against Covid-19. The country relied much on the power of innovation, collaboration, and a shared commitment to health to destroy the dreaded disease.In its report titled “The Power of Innovation,” the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines (PHAP) provided a detailed and insightful perspective of the lessons learned and ways forward coming from a global crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic.One such insight was how the Philippines, particularly the Philippine biopharmaceutical industry, stood strong and resilient, where it relied on ingenuity and likewise displayed an extraordinary ability to forge strong partnerships and innovative mindset amid the adversity.It also showed how PHAP and its member-companies bonded together and acted swiftly to ensure that essential supplies like testing kits, vaccines and antiviral treatments were accessible and available and that the supply chain was maintained even during the lockdowns in order to protect public health.“Capturing these insights ensures that the knowledge gained from our experiences can serve as a valuable resource for current and future challenges as we fully navigate our way out of the impact of the pandemic. In the ever-evolving healthcare landscape, documenting our successes becomes a crucial compass guiding us towards effective strategies and resilient responses. The ultimate power of innovation lies in its ability to save and improve lives so that the people can contribute to social and economic progress,” said Dr. Diana Edralin, President of PHAP.AMONG those highlighted in the report was how the Philippine pharmaceutical industry and PHAP members helped the country in the fight against Covid-19 by increasing access to medicines, drive economic growth, and how it fostered collaboration to build healthcare ecosystems.PHAP members also supported frontline workers and worked with the government to facilitate the swift entry of medical innovations such as test kits, vaccines, and even treatments.The organization assisted in helping deliver 245.54 million Covid-19 vaccines as of June 2022. It also fast-tracked the launch of diagnostic kits so that companies and families can conduct antigen testing. From anti-bacterial treatments to monoclonal antibodies, working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), innovative, clinically proven anti-Covid drugs were also made available to minimize severe infections and improve overall health outcomes for Covid-19 patients. This resulted in better patient load management in hospitals, shorter hospitalization, and reduced strain on the country’s healthcare system. PHAP also partnered with the Department of Health to increase awareness on the safety and efficacy of vaccines and beat vaccine hesitancy.Since 2020, PHAP members also worked tirelessly to make the Philippines a priority country to receive supplies of medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics. It even collaborated with the government in monitoring the supply of needed medicines for both Covid and non-Covid conditions like hypertension, diabetes, antibiotics and cancer, among others, and organized chartered flights to make these life-saving innovations available to Filipino patients amid the global demand and strict lockdowns. The report also stressed the link between health and economic development, particularly investments in health not just for sustaining economic growth but to promote creativity, innovation, and improved quality of life.The PHAP also pointed to the pharmaceutical industry’s vital role to the country’s economic health, reaching P238 billion in contributions to the country’s Gross Domestic Product, and even in employee development and healthcare professional education.The organization also helped to advance medical research, where it completed and continued over 154 clinical trials in the past two years, where companies introduced 575 novel drugs over the last five years in critical areas such as cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, oncology, and others, as part of its role to propel the nation forward through comprehensive healthcare contributions.The report also showed how digital technology was also vital to help navigate through the numerous complexities of vaccine supply and distribution and empower local government units and enable individuals to monitor their vaccination records. Additionally, pharmaceutical companies actively engaged in multi-channel communication to disseminate critical medical information, while supply chain providers developed apps to streamline vaccine distribution.THE report highlighted collaboration, where PHAP member-companies collaborated closely with the government and various organizations, and placed high value on building bridges and partnerships where it worked closely with patient groups, medical societies, hospitals, and healthcare professionals in dealing with the pandemic’s intricate challenges.PHAP also expressed its commitment to collaborative efforts in four key areas, such as support to the country’s journey to universal healthcare, plus sharing of best practices with regulatory bodies like the FDA and Health Technology Assessment Unit with the aim of establishing a world-class healthcare system in the country. It also aims to place the Philippines as a Center of Excellence in Clinical Research in ASEAN through collaborative research for medical advancements. Finally, PHAP will also advance knowledge and technology transfers to strengthen the DOH’s capabilities, such as on pandemic preparedness, human capital development, and supply chain optimization.“The Power of Innovation is a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of the Philippines in the face of adversity. It serves as a poignant reminder that innovation, collaboration, and a shared commitment to health are powerful tools that can help us prepare for the next pandemic and build resilient healthcare systems as no one sector can do it alone,” said PHAP Executive Director Teodoro Padilla."

Just like 11-year-old Princess B. Espera who hails from Sorsogon Province, this initiative has inspired her professional aspirations and the path she wishes to follow in the years to come.“When I grow up, I want to become a nurse so I can help people get their smiles back,” she said in mixed Filipino and English.Princess also credits her mother Mary Grace Espera and school nurse Dr. Wilma P. Olbez, who both serve as her role models and supporters in pursuing her dream.Her mom instilled in her a degree of discipline when it comes to oral health. She said: “I always taught her to keep her teeth clean. It’s important that her mouth is healthy.”For Princess, Dr. Olbez’s dedication to help her classmates maintain good oral health is moving. In fact, she noted that “whenever she has free time, she always checks our teeth.”THE school nurse believes it is important to teach children on how crucial oral health is to enhance overall well-being, as recent studies from the Department of Education show cavities are the main reason why kids miss school, thus affecting their learning capacity.Colgate keeps its commitment to ensure a healthier and brighter future for children worldwide via the BSBF program. In the Philippines, it has so far reached 37,000 public schools and 700 daycare centers in 319 cities and municipalities for 25 years, benefiting 40 million children nationwide.Recently, Colgate returned to Sorsogon Province, increasing the number of orally fit children from 12 percent rate in 2015 to 80 percent in 2022, according to the Field Health Service Information System report.With this continuous partnership, Princess and her counterparts in Sorsogon learn the importance of a healthy smile in numerous facets of life.“Brushing your teeth shouldn’t be scary! The Bright Smiles Bright Futures program helped me realize that smiling makes me more confident to pursue my dreams. Let’s all smile together for a better future!” Princess said."

Additionally, a total of 442 cases were reported in the recent four weeks,” the DOH said.At the regional level, Ilocos Region, Calabarzon, and Zamboanga Peninsula showed continuous increase in the recent six-week period (October 15 to November 25), while the National Capital Region, Central Luzon, Bicol Region, Davao Region, Socsksargen, and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao showed case increases in the recent three to four weeks, reporting two to 253 new cases in the recent four weeks.For the same period, there were also 16 deaths related to measles and rubella, compared to zero deaths for the same period last year.Measles and rubella can be prevented by vaccines. Children from nine to 59 months or under five years old should be protected through vaccination to keep cases low.Last May, the DOH implemented Measles-Rubella-bivalent Oral Polio vaccine supplemental immunization activity for a month to mitigate the impending risk of a measles outbreak among children under fiveyears old.The agency was able to vaccinate 8,164,031 or 84 percent of the target population.Meantime, partial unofficial data on the coverage for two doses of measles-containing vaccine is at 45.52 percent as of September 2023.Since quality supplemental immunization activity requires 90 percent coverage of the target population, the DOH urges all sectors and units of government to work together, using primary health care as a platform to reach and vaccinate every missed child."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/12/27/philippine-based-ngo-readies-push-for-global-elimination-of-lead-in-paints/,Philippine-based NGO readies push for global elimination of lead in paints,"With the backing of the domestic paint industry, a Philippine-based nongovernment organization will be advocating for international control on the trade of lead chromates, the most common lead-based pigments, by listing lead chromates and paint products containing them under the Rotterdam Convention.The group will be working closely with the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) in this advocacy.This was disclosed by the EcoWaste Coalition, a non-profit environmental health organization, as the group lauded the Chemical Control Order (CCO) banning lead—a potent neurotoxin causing irreversible damage to children’s brain—in the production of paints as the groundbreaking regulation marked its 10th anniversary last Saturday.Issued by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources-Environmental Management Bureau (DENR-EMB) on December 23, the group described the broadly supported regulation as “a splendid Christmas gift to our children” upon its release 10 years ago.Also referred to as DENR Administrative Order No. 2013-24, the CCO provided for a three-year phase-out period for architectural, household, and decorative paints (2013-2016), and a longer six-year phase out for paints used in industrial applications (2013-2019).It also established a maximum of 90 parts per million (ppm) total limit for lead in all paints, the strictest regulatory standard for lead in paint.According to EcoWaste Coalition, the issuance of the CCO prompted paint makers to replace lead-based pigments, driers and anti-corrosive agents with non-lead alternatives thereby contributing to the decreased importation and consumption of lead chromates and other leaded raw materials.The DENR’s EMB has stopped issuing importation permits for such materials intended for use in paint manufacturing.A case study prepared with inputs from the government, industry, and civil society stakeholders for the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint (or the Lead Paint Alliance) identified several factors that contributed to the successful implementation of the CCO, including “data on lead in solvent-based paints generated by the civil society that provided evidence of a pressing problem requiring immediate and collective action, multi-faceted efforts to raise awareness about the issue, industry-wide shift that created the impetus for all companies to transition to lead-safe paint formulations, and the government’s commitment to a multi-stakeholders approach.”The Philippine Association of Paint Manufacturers (now called the Philippine Paint and Coatings Association or PPCA) has actively promoted the CCO to its member-companies, providing them with venues like workshops to understand in-depth the hazards of lead, the need to remove lead in paint formulations, and the availability of alternatives. As confirmed by PPCA, affiliated paint makers have all transitioned to lead-free paint production.Aside from providing inputs to policy and technical deliberations, the EcoWaste Coalition took on the role of a watchdog group, conducting lead paint studies, tracking the sale of non-compliant products in the market, duly notifying regulatory bodies and companies, and creating media stories for greater public awareness and to encourage regulatory action.The group’s latest study in October 2023 still found lead-containing paints produced by non-PPCA-affiliated companies in the market, providing a strong justification to strengthen compliance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to uphold the lead paint ban.According to the EcoWaste Coalition, the CCO protects the human rights of groups most vulnerable to the adverse effects of lead exposure, particularly children, women, and workers.The CCO protects children, including babies in the womb, from being exposed to lead in paints and other sources, which can negatively impact their right to good health and a better future, noting lead exposure can bring about reduced economic productivity and earning potential.For the workers, eliminating lead is essential to reduce occupational exposures and avoid health problems linked with chronic lead exposure, including increased risk of hypertension, heart disease, and reproductive health issues for women and men, the group said.The CCO also resulted in the issuance of related national and local policies, including Department of Education (DepEd) Order No. 4, s.2017, Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Memorandum Circular No. 2018-26 and an unnumbered Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) directive requiring the mandatory use of lead-safe paints by schools, local government units (LGUs), and residential and non-residential social welfare facilities, respectively.Last April, the DILG issued an advisory reiterating the use of lead-safe paints by LGUs.While third-party certification is not integrated into the CCO, the promulgation of the policy led to the birth of a voluntary Lead Safe Paint Certification program initiated by the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) with support from EcoWaste Coalition and the PPCA. This third-party certification program verifies and certifies that a paint brand has less than 90 ppm lead allowing it to use the Lead Safe Paint logo. This visual tool can assist consumers in making an informed choice when purchasing paints.To date, four local paint manufacturers have successfully passed the rigorous Lead Safe Paint verification procedures conducted by SCS Global Services, the US-based certification body, including Pacific Paints (Boysen) Philippines Inc., Davies Paints Philippines, Inc., Sycwin Coating and Wires Inc., and Asian Coatings Philippines Inc. Another company, Roosevelt Chemical Inc. (maker of Triton paints), is undergoing certification.Jonathan L. Mayuga is a journalist for more than 15 years.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/12/21/control-mold-spores-in-the-house-by-controlling-indoor-moisture/,Control mold spores in the house by controlling indoor moisture,"There is no denying that molds are part of nature since they function by breaking down and digesting plant and animal matter and other organic materials in our environment.However, the benefits that molds offer end the moment they start growing indoors, essentially in our homes or even offices, and they can have nasty and deadly effects, especially on our health.According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the reproduction process of molds begin through tiny spores, those that are invisible to the human eye and can drift, glide and float in the air, whether indoors or outdoors. The US EPA said mold may begin growing indoors when mold spores land on wet surfaces. There are many mold types, says the US EPA, and none will grow without water or moisture.THE moment molds land on a wet or damp spot and they grow, that’s when health problems arise, according to the US EPA. “Molds produce allergens (substances that can cause allergic reactions), irritants, and in some cases, potentially toxic substances (mycotoxins). Inhaling or touching mold or mold spores may cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Allergic responses include hay fever-type symptoms, such as sneezing, runny nose, red eyes, and skin rash (dermatitis).”The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said “exposure to molds in the air could bring about ailments including sore throat, cough, stuffy nose, burning eyes, and skin rash. These could also be an immediate trigger for people with asthma, while immunocompromised ones and those with chronic lung disease may incur severe respiratory infections.”As the weather shifted from the hot to the rainy season, people can expect humidity levels to shoot up in places such as homes or offices, and this condition can spur the reproduction of molds. However, molds still need moisture in order to grow, and they usually appear as spots or stains on ceilings, walls, and other surfaces. In areas where moisture management such as water leaks, flooding, condensation and yes, high humidity, is present, expect molds to spread further and stay on materials such as wood, dry wall, paper, insulators, even fabrics such as carpet or upholstery.SINCE they float through the air and in house dust, the CDC said it would be impossible to get rid of all mold and mold spores found indoors. They can be prevented and controlled from spreading by controlling indoor moisture. Home or office maintenance personnel should clean up the mold and fix the moisture issue. If the mold has been removed but the moisture problems remain, then there is the high likelihood that mold will simply come back.GETTING rid of mold is not easy, but “mold remediation,” a process utilized by experts with the help of effective solutions, is most recommended. However, the process could be complicated since it requires unique skills and expertise in order to control mold contamination.According to Ederine Gee Geneblazo, President/Managing Director of Rentokil Initial Philippines, the Mold Remediation Treatment is a multi-step process that starts with a comprehensive pre-assessment in order to determine and identify the cause. “This aspect also dictates the process of removal of mold, whether via steam, spray, space treatment or a combination of all. After removal, maintenance is recommended such as through a moisture control pouch, air purifier and/or air sterilizer.”Geneblazo also echoed the fact that molds grow in environments with high humidity. “When everything was closed down during the pandemic many commercial buildings like retail shops and store outlets experienced this because of prolonged shutdown of businesses and poor air circulation.”While there are do-it-yourself solutions for mold removal, Geneblazo said it would be wise to let the professionals handle the problem. She said that mold can possibly survive simple treatments and may still continue to grow and infect more areas in the house or office, emphasizing that mold spores will remain and continue contaminating the air people breathe if not effectively controlled at once.She said that the Initial Hygiene Mold Remediation Treatment is based on the science and facts from the pre-assessment, and expertise of the microbiologists of Initial Hygiene, which has been in the business of providing remedies to unwanted manifestations of fungi, bacteria, a nd other harmful microorganisms whether at home, in the office, or just about any indoor space for the past 120 years. “All the steps in the program will help identify, address, and prevent molds and we provide the expertise that will help people understand how and guide them through in addressing mold issues.”"

Your children might be eating commercial foods that are high in sugar and salt content.A new study across seven countries showed that high sugar and salt content in commercial foods are marketed for young children in Southeast Asia. The study revealed that an alarming 72 percent of snacks and finger foods targeting children under three years old contain added sugars and sweeteners.A new study, supported by UNICEF and partners of the Consortium for Improving Complementary Foods in Southeast Asia (COMMIT), assessed more than 1,600 infant cereals, purées, pouches, snacks and ready-to-eat meals marketed for young children in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.The results of the study, which were released on December 14, 2023, revealed high sugar and salt content in commercially produced packaged foods marketed for children aged six months to three years in Southeast Asia, as well as the widespread use of potentially misleading and deceptive labelling and lack of strict regulations around product composition and sale.It also studied consumer behaviors and existing regulations in the seven countries.THE study found that nearly half of the products studied (44 percent) included added sugars and sweeteners; among snacks and fingers foods, this rose to 72 percent. When it came to salt content, more than one third of the products studied included more sodium than recommended.Furthermore, nearly 90 percent of the labels on the products studied included potentially misleading or deceptive claims about their composition.“Far too many of the food products being marketed to the youngest girls and boys are unhealthy and labelled in ways that may deceive parents,” said Debora Comini, UNICEF Regional Director for East Asia and the Pacific. “Children and their parents deserve better.”Commercially produced complementary foods are a common part of the diets of young children in Southeast Asia, with 79 percent of mothers from urban centers reporting they provide these foods to their young children daily.ACROSS Southeast Asia, the sale of commercially produced complementary foods has risen by 45 percent in the past five years.In terms of regulation, the study noted that none of the seven countries had national policies on the composition and labelling of commercially produced complementary foods which follow all international guidance. Several countries were found to have no legal measures to regulate the sugar or salt content of commercially produced complementary foods.Countries with maximum sugar or salt thresholds often only applied them to certain categories, such as cereals or snack foods, and the thresholds were higher than international standards.Sugar intake early in life can lead to cavities, weight gain, and poor eating habits, while high sodium intake can lead to high blood pressure, with impacts that can be lifelong.Extensive use of claims was also found, with claims about product composition or nutrient content appearing on nearly 90 percent of the products assessed.Common claims appearing on products with high sugar, salt or fat content included “all natural,” “good source of vitamins,” and “no artificial ingredients.” FURTHER, in Cambodia, Philippines and Lao PDR, the majority of products were only labelled in English or non-national languages, limiting the ability of parents to make informed choices to ensure nutritious diets for their children.“Governments and food producers can, and must, play a stronger role in safeguarding the health of the youngest children,” underlined Comini. “Good nutrition in the first years of life helps children thrive, fueling prosperous families, productive workforces and powerful economies,” Comoni addes.On the other hand, she said, poor nutrition increases the risk of stunting, wasting, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight, obesity and disease, ultimately coming at great cost to children and their families, but also to healthcare systems and economies.”1. Improved government regulations for commercially produced complementary foods, including prohibiting the use of added sugars and sweeteners, limiting sugar and sodium content, and prohibiting misleading marketing and labelling.2.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/12/19/holiday-treat-for-hog-farmers-groups-hopeful-that-fda-may-soon-greenlight-asf-vaccine/,Holiday treat for hog farmers? Groups hopeful that FDA may soon greenlight ASF vaccine,"Hog farmers in the country are eager to hear good news regarding the certification of the African swine fever (ASF) vaccine submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a sector representative recently revealed. ASF is a deadly disease that kills hogs in a matter of days. More than half of the hog population of the Philippines has been affected by the disease.According to Dr. Niño Bagui, Assistant Vice President of Soro-soro Ibaba Development Cooperative — one of the largest hog farm cooperatives in the country with more than 67,000 members — demand for the vaccine continues to mount, as more farmers appealed to the government “to make the vaccine available soon, especially to small hold farmers. We are looking forward in seeing vaccination as a more sustainable and long-term action that will help and propel the hog sector to get back on track.”Jeffrey Virgo, who runs a small hog farm, joined the call for the FDA’s swift action. “Farmers like me and our families, all we want is to put this thing behind us. I wish that the availability of the vaccine will be the government’s for us,” he said in Filipino.To date, the most promising swine fever vaccine on the local horizon is the ASF AVAC LIVE, which is manufactured by AVAC Vietnam and exclusively distributed by KPP Powers Commodities, Inc.The application to secure the vaccine’s Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) from the FDA was initiated more than a year ago last November 2022, and farmers nationwide have since been yearning for an update. Domestic and commercial use of AVAC ASF LIVE in Vietnam earned approval last year, after trials yielded an efficacy rate of 95% out of the 650,000 doses tested on hog herds in 40 of the country’s provinces. Likewise, an independent assessment by a delegation of the United States Department of Agriculture on the Vietnamese vaccine corroborated the findings of safety and efficacy, which reportedly met international standards submitted to the World Organization for Animal Health.In the Philippines, local trials were conducted this year under the supervision of the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI). The results of these tests —which showed a 100% success rate in Phase 1 — prompted the FDA to approve the importation of 300,000 doses as trials proceed.KPP Powers Managing Director Juancho Robles further emphasized the industry’s demand for ASF immunization, stating, “we share the sentiment of farmers, producers, and even consumers that have been yearning for positive news as soon as possible.” According to Dr. Maximino Montenegro, the veterinary consultant who assisted in the conduct of the trials, the overall results of the trials showed that the ASF vaccine is safe for pigs. “The industry as a whole has already suffered hundreds of billions in losses because of ASF, which has led to a more than 150% increase in the country’s pork imports compared to two years ago,” Bagui underscored. In 2021, the Philippines imported approximately 280 metric tons of pork. This year, it is estimated that the figure could go beyond 710 metric tons. Robles likewise warned that time could be running out for a significant segment of the country’s pork producers. “For most farmers, it’s no longer about profits, it has become a matter of survival now,” he added, “countless farms are facing debt and growing financial troubles, and are considering closing their facilities altogether.” “The testing of the AVAC vaccine was one of the happiest news we’ve had in a while,” Virgo recalled. “In the coming months, we hope to hear of another positive development. It won’t be just a Christmas or New Year gift to us farmers, actually, but also something to help the entire country greet 2024 with higher hopes,” he concluded."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/12/19/towards-achieving-zero-dengue-deaths-learnings-from-asean-experience-on-dengue-prevention-and-control/,Towards achieving zero-dengue deaths: Learnings from ASEAN experience on dengue prevention and control,"Vaccines are widely recognized as essential public health interventions that prevent various infectious diseases. To underscore the importance of disseminative vital knowledge in the ongoing battle against vaccine-preventable illnesses, and in navigating the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual Philippine National Immunization Conference (24 PNIC) was held in Cebu City. With the theme “The Big Catch Up: Closing in, Renewing the Vaxx-P.A.C.T.”, the last day of the weeklong conference brought together healthcare professionals, policymakers, and various medical organizations to delve into crucial aspects such as vaccine efficacy, safety, effectiveness, and implications within the Asian context. Dengue, considered as endemic in the Philippines, was among the key discussions in this medical convention. In the dengue surveillance report from the Department of Health (DOH), there have been 155,823 cases and 575 deaths recorded in the country as of October 28, 2023.Pediatric infectious disease specialist Dr. Jonathan G. Lim highlighted the importance of having an integrated multi-pronged response in the prevention and control of dengue infection. He said, “It is well-established that when dealing with dengue, the available treatment is largely supportive, as there are no specific antibiotics or clear medications for the condition. Prevention is deemed a crucial strategy in addressing dengue [and] immunization emerges as a key preventive measure.”In Indonesia, the dengue burden remains high with increasing impact over the years despite the existing vector control strategy. Dr. Sri Rezeki S. Hadinegoro of the Indonesian Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (ITAGI) emphasized the 6 pillars of the National Strategy for Innovative Dengue Prevention. This includes leveraging the latest technology to propel the inventions, innovation, and research on the dengue program.Dr. Hadinegoro also cited the important role of vaccination in reducing the incidence of dengue and dengue-related hospitalizations. Two vaccines are presently available in Indonesia and are indicated for use in eligible individuals 6 to 45 years old. The vaccines been recommended for use by different medical societies including the Indonesian Pediatric Society and the Indonesia Society of Internal Medicine.Dr. Hadinegoro highlighted the importance of multi-sectoral collaboration in fighting dengue. Support from the Ministry of Health, different universities, NGOs, and the Indonesian Parliament strengthened community engagement through disease awareness initiatives on traditional media channels, professional collaborations, and social media platforms. “It is crucial to emphasize preventive measures by controlling mosquitoes. Strategically, the vaccine should be administered as part of a well-designed community strategy and community engagement for effective completion,” she concluded.In Thailand, Dr. Suda Punrin of Queen Saobvha Memorial Institute and Thai Red Cross, shared the dengue burden in their country where 123,000 cases as of October 2023 were reported. The age distribution of cases reveals that dengue predominantly impacts the 5-14 age group, followed by the elderly population. This demographic shift underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing dengue. The Ministry of Public Health of Thailand anchors its surveillance efforts and targeted prevention on three key measures: collection, prevention, and disease control. This includes covering water storage containers, proper garbage disposal, and environmental improvements.While vaccination is recognized as an important preventive measure against this disease, the dengue immunization journey in the country previously faced a decline in participation due to the pre-vaccination screening requirement. The laboratory procedure prior to vaccine administration entails additional steps and spending from the patients. With the second-generation dengue vaccines indicated for use among individuals regardless of dengue exposure history, Dr. Punrin shared her optimism that this will improve the access to dengue vaccine.Dr. Punrin concluded that vaccination rollout should be anchored on a well-designed disease awareness and patient education program, emphasizing the importance of ongoing preventive and vector-control measures.The World Health Organization is targeting zero deaths from dengue as part of its 2021-2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The WHO recognizes that vaccination is a critical intervention in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. It also cited that a safe, effective and affordable dengue vaccine against the four strains of the dengue virus would represent a major advance for the control of dengue especially in endemic countries.Disease awareness, community engagement and a well-designed communication strategy are important pillars in the implementation of public health programs. Until vaccination against dengue is implemented in the Philippines, the experiences from ASEAN neighbors Indonesia and Thailand provide valuable learnings in further strengthening the dengue program in the country.References:The BusinessMirror provides readers with a broader look at today’s business in these challenging times.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/12/18/from-enhancing-eyebrows-to-full-service-beauty-hub/,From enhancing eyebrows to full service beauty hub,"Prettylooks, a sought-after aesthetic center, offers a wide range of services such as eyebrow enhancements, eyeliner, lip tint, hairline, scalp micropigmentation, and skin care. But behind this successful brand is a driven woman with a passion for beauty.A clinical pharmacist by profession, Susan Ong dela Fuente, the Chairwoman of Prettylooks who founded the brand four decades ago in General Santos City, Mindanao initially as a small salon. Recently, the brand marked its 40th anniversary in the industry with a celebratory event at the Marriot Manila Hotel.Susan’s inspiration stemmed from her victory as Mutya ng Davao in April 1983, which “inspired me to put up a beauty clinic, because I think it was something that was in line with what I wanted to do,” she told BusinessMirror. Ong’s salon initially offered the usual services such as haircuts, manicures, and facials. She, however, wanted to offer something more, something that would set her apart from the rest.She noticed that the Taiwanese had come to the Philippines and started doing eyebrows, which was a new and popular trend at that time. Her father encouraged her to go to Taiwan to study the craft, so she did and soon became one of the pioneers of aesthetic eyebrows in the country. “If there’s a will, there’s always a way. So I found myself trying and trying,” she underscored. While it first focused on eyebrows, Prettylooks has evolved into a comprehensive beauty hub with multiple branches across the Philippines. Susan, along with her daughter Steffi Blair Ong-Chan, the Pretty Looks President and Chief Executive Officer, emphasized the company’s commitment to non-surgical procedures, including permanent makeup, facial enhancements, and underarm whitening.Susan revealed that their services, including the once-painful eyebrow procedure, are now relatively painless, “ I would say it’s pretty much painless because my daughter was able to find something new that is an anesthetic that would take [effect for] 10 minutes long.”She emphasized the shift from traditional tattoos to the cutting-edge techniques of today, “We don’t call it a tattoo anymore,” Ong declared, reflecting on her experience. “Before, during my time, it was an aesthetic tattoo. So what is it now? We call it aesthetic eyebrow stranding.”Ong highlighted the evolution of techniques, with the most basic one being 4D cloning. She outlined the progression from the “eyebrow reborn” to the advanced methods of “cashmere,” “eyebrow stranding,” and the innovative “silk method.”Addressing concerns about pain, Ong clarified that while the procedure involves a needle, it is not painful as it targets only the dermis and epidermis layers.As for the longevity of the effect, Ong shared, “If you want it permanent, we can make it permanent. But for some, especially the younger generation, they prefer it [to be] semi-permanent.”Ong emphasized the importance of customization, stating, “It’s all about tailoring the procedure to individual preferences and lifestyles.”Beyond its renowned expertise in eyebrow enhancements, Prettylooks has become a sought-after destination for a myriadof non-surgical procedures that cater to various areas of the face and body. The staff at Prettylooks shed light on the most popular services and unveiled a spectrum of options for clients seeking subtle enhancements and non-invasive transformations.Enhancements for the nose and lips have also gained significant traction that offers clients the opportunity to refine and accentuate these features without the need for invasive surgeries.The clinic addresses various beauty concerns including permanent hair removal and whitening with effective solutions, that caters to the unique preferences of their clients.The art of permanent makeup also continues to be a cornerstone service at Prettylooks that provides clients with a lasting solution for individuals seeking enduring enhancements without the need for daily makeup application.While the focus is primarily on facial treatments, Prettylooks also offers solutions for specific areas on the face, such as reducing a double chin, the clinic avoids venturing into full-body weight loss procedures, opting for a targeted approach that aligns with their expertise.Prettylooks also introduces a cutting-edge anti-aging procedure known as exosome that utilizes a specialized gun with nine needles. This non-surgical treatment penetrates the dermal layer, delivering a potent blend of hyaluronic acid and polylactic acid to defy the effects of aging.“Our procedures are all non-surgical; we leave the surgical to the surgeons,” she remarked and highlighted their dedication to client satisfaction, with services often showing visible effects within 10 days.Prettylooks continues to push the boundaries of non-surgical aesthetics and offers a comprehensive range of services that address diverse beauty concerns while maintaining a commitment to safety and natural results.Meanwhile, in the showbiz industry, where appearances matter, two leading ladies, Ellen Adarna and Jennylyn Mercado, have emerged as avid patrons of the beauty sanctuary Pretty Looks. Jennylyn Mercado, celebrated for her beauty and talent, expressed, “If you look good on the outside, you will feel more confident, which also in a way affects how we view ourselves and others.” The actress emphasized the interconnectedness of outer appearance and self-esteem.On the other hand, Ellen Adarna, known for her beauty and charisma, shared valuable advice for those seeking to maintain their “pretty looks” during stressful times, particularly the bustling Holiday season filled with parties. “Prioritize what really matters and swallow some Vitamin N—Vitamin No. You always have a choice,” in moments of stress, she personally finds solace in indulging in self-care rituals like pedicures and massages.Beyond these leading ladies, Prettylooks has garnered star-studded clients including Ella Cruz, Cory Quirino, Arci Munoz, Alex and Toni Gonzaga, Daiana Menezes, Alexa Ilacad, as well as popular influencers Viy Cortez, Ivana Alawi, Baninay, and others.PrettyLooks continues to be the go-to destination for celebrities and influencers, offering a range of services that cater to the diverse beauty preferences of its discerning clientele.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/30/golden-hour-and-silver-linings-in-heart-attacks/,Golden Hour and Silver Linings in Heart Attacks,"About one in every five Filipinos die each year because of heart disease. This is a sad reality that has been perennially staring us all direct in the eyes for so many years now.In the year 2022 11-month (excluding December) data gathered by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), ischemic heart disease, or the weakening of the heart caused by reduced blood flow, was responsible for 103,628 deaths, or 18.4 percent of the total cause of mortality in the country. Despite advances in medicine and technology, this modern-day curse persists not only in the Philippines but also worldwide. Many years ago, the common victims of this disease belong to the older age bracket of 50 and above. Today, patients as young as in their 30’s is not uncommon. Fortunately, like every proverbial dark cloud, there are now silver linings when it comes to heart attack.First, heart attacks need not be a death or disability sentence anymore. When the patient is brought immediately for proper care in a medical facility, the chance of survival is great. In a nutshell, survival from a heart attack episode depends on the time the patient is brought to the doctor after it occurred.For example, for patients requiring an angioplasty, when this procedure is performed within what we call the Golden Period or four hours after the attack, the chance of survival is good as much as the heart muscle can be saved from permanent damage. Thus, in any heart attack, every second counts and every minute spells either life or death. Time decides what needs to be done immediately and next to save the heart, life even function of the patient. This is especially true with the proper care that may involve a team of multi-specialty doctors including rehabilitative and preventive cardiology physicians, a heart attack patient can be saved, revived and returned to normal. Parang walang nangyari.Second, being mindful and alert of the warning signs of a heart attack is a lifesaver. People must not be over-confident whenever they do not feel anything wrong in their body. For, deep inside their body may lurk the silent groundworks for the eventual heart failure. The key is, we must always be careful with our heart and watch out for our lifestyle and take note of the elements like smoking, fatty food diet, lack of exercise and sleep, family history, among others.The secret to combatting deaths due to heart disease requires the teamwork of both patients and their doctors. We, as cardiologists, on our part are happy that modern science and medicine have enabled us to have at our disposal better care armaments. For example, we now have an injectable formula that is found more effective in lowering cholesterol which is one of the leading risk factors for heart failure.That this new and modern treatment modalities do not translate to better heart failure outcomes can be simply attributed to that fact that, whatever strides science and medicine accomplish, the fast-changing lifestyle dynamics counter. Think about how our daily living landscape has transmogrified into the proliferation of unhealthy diet, ubiquitous fast foods, prolonged tinkering with our cellular phones and laptops, extended socials with friends and peers in bars, self-imposed sleep deprivation and adapting to it, and many others.In many other instances, patients confuse chest pains as being simply caused by hyperacidity or acid reflux that they self- medicate. In this regard, the general rule to note is that chest pains resulting from performing an activity or exerting physical effort might be early signs of heart failure. For example, when you suddenly feel shortness of breath when doing a regular length of walk or flight of stairs may be warning signs that you have to go to your doctor immediately. Kung yung kotse nga nadadala mo sa casa every five kilometers of travel, sariling katawan mo pa kaya? A regular visit to your doctor will be best."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/30/mental-well-being-should-be-part-of-basic-health-services-expert/,Mental well-being should be part of basic health services—expert,"THE national government has been called on to include mental well-being in its basic health services given that more and more people have recognized its impact on their overall conditions. “It should be delivered in the same manner as the government is delivering the basic health services,” Capstone-Intel Corp. Chief of Public Affairs Atty. Nic. A Conti told reporters in a media briefing held in Quezon City last November 16. Republic Act No. 11036, or the National Mental Health Law, provides a rights-based mental health legislation and a comprehensive framework for the enforcement of optimal healthcare in the Philippines. One of its vital mandates is the integration of national mental health services to the delivery of basic health services. Since this is not yet a reality in the country, he attributed this to the reluctance of many Filipinos to deal with it even though they are more cognizant of it.BASED on the results of this nationwide survey conducted by Capstone-Intel from September 20 to 27, 93 percent of 1,210 respondents are aware of the term mental health. More than half or 52 percent rated their overall mental health as good; 33 percent, excellent; 13 percent, fair; and two percent, poor. In terms of age group or generation, the boomers (zero percent) don’t feel they have poor mental health, as opposed to Gen X (three percent), Gen Z (two percent), and Millennials (2 percent).Sixty-five percent of the participants stated that they had experienced an impactful life experience that affected their mental health. Location-wise, more than half have said so, with the Cordillera Administrative Region having the highest level at 89 percent.Unfortunately, this is not the case for 35 percent who answered “no”, as five percent are unsure. From those who admitted to having issues on their mental well-being due to what happened to them, majority or 79 percent have not consulted with a professional and only 21 percent have done so.“So the reasons why mental health consultation level is low are the lack of awareness, shortage of facilities and professionals to turn to, and it’s not integrated into the delivery of basic health services,” Conti said, while citing that many people today are still in denial of having a mental problem because of the social stigma that comes with it.“That’s why research like this is aligned also with the policy of the government that engage information dissemination on mental health issues.”More than three-fourths or 84 percent reported no diagnosis, while 16 percent said yes. Of the 188 surveyed who bared that they have been diagnosed with such condition, more than half reported to have anxiety disorder (54 percent) and depression (52 percent) depression. Others claimed to have an eating disorder (18 percent), post-traumatic stress disorder (18 percent), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (13 percent), bipolar (13 percent), obsessive-compulsive disorder (7 percent), schizophrenia (7 percent), and other conditions (2 percent). Some would rather not say their concern (9 percent). Anxiety is higher among female participants (57 percent) compared to their male counterparts (52 percent). The trend is opposite when it comes to depression as it is experienced by more men (53 percent) than women (49 percent).In terms of responses on current treatment, it varied with 28 percent receiving therapy only, 20 percent using medication only, 19 percent getting both, 17 percent have received treatment in the past, and 16 percent have never sought professional help. The research, likewise, examined the different strategies employed by respondents to sustain or improve their mental well-being, with a substantial majority or 80 percent indicated that they participate in exercise or physical activities; 72 percent engaged in social interactions with friends and family; 65 percent focused on music, arts, and entertainment; 61 percent practiced mindfulness, meditation, or spirituality; 46 percent resorted to travel; 44 percent prioritized the care of their plants and pets; and 29 percent got involved in arts and crafts.THE findings of the study based on Sentiment Analysis of social media posts of the respondents clearly indicate the need to address mental health issue in the country post-pandemic.“That could be a guidance on the private sector and the government on how we are going to boost the [mental health] programs,” Capstone-Intel Research and Publications Director Ella Kristina D. Coronel said.For her, one area such an initiative can be held is within schools, particularly through Physical Education classes. She believes that incorporating mental health education and exercises into the curriculum will enable students to better understand the importance of mental well-being from an early age. On the other hand, Octa Research Chief Data Scientist Dr. Guido David pointed out the need to address the lack of psychological professionals, which pertains to guidance counselors in schools. On the average, he said that most primary and secondary schools as well as universities in the country usually have only one of them to look for the welfare of the entire student population. ”We have to scale up our staffing. Because they’re understaffed, it’s more difficult for them to reach out to these children or students who are having issues like mental health they are not aware of. If there’s more staff [like them], then we can actually be more proactive rather than reactive. We can do evaluations, assessments of their status, and estimate what courses of action to take,” he said.Expanding these initiatives beyond schools, regular mental health check-ins should also be encouraged within companies, among employees, and within the wider community. By nurturing a culture of mental well-being and providing the necessary resources, they can collectively work towards a healthier and more resilient society.“For graduating students who will join the workforce, as well as new or prospective employees, ‘work and life’ balance is important,” Dr. David stressed.Roderick L.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/25/a-milestone-in-healthcare/,A milestone in healthcare,"Last year, among the top 10 leading causes of death in the country included chronic lung disease, tuberculosis, pneumonia, CoViD-19 infection, and lung cancer. Out of the four million Filipinos who contracted CoViD-19, 280,000 continue to suffer from long CoViD syndrome.Despite the enactment of several laws to curb smoking in the country, many Filipinos are still suffering from smoking-related lung diseases. The need for pulmonary rehabilitation to help those suffering from difficulty in breathing remains. Along with this is the need for an improved venue where pulmonary rehabilitation can be best carried out—both for in person and virtual sessions.Located at the Philippine General Hospital is the UP- PGH Pulmonary Care Center & Post CoViD Hub which aims to help Filipinos afflicted with chronic lung diseases and long CoViD-19 syndrome to breathe and live better. It is a milestone in healthcare as it is the first post-CoVid hub in the country.It was recently inaugurated with PGH Director Dr. Gerardo Legaspi; Division of Pulmonary Medicine Head Dr. Lenora C. Fernandez; Dr. Joselito Chavez, former chief of the Division of Pulmonary Medicine; Dr. Carissa Paz C. Dioquino, Chair, Department of Neurosciences; Dr. John Anonuevo, Chair, Department of Medicine; and fellows of the Pulmonary Division, among others. SM Foundation was represented by Executive Director for Health and Medical Programs Connie Angeles; Board of Trustee Engr. Gil Macapagal; Senior Project Manager Albert Uy and Assistant Project Manager Roma Hierro in attendance.It is the 199 SM Foundation Wellness Center and is the third project of SM Foundation with PGH’s Division of Pulmonary Medicine. The first was the renovation of the Pulmonary room at the Out Patient Department. This was followed two years later with the renovation of another room to house the CPET (Cardio-Pulmonary Exercise Testing) machine and as venue of Pulmonary rehab sessions. The UP- PGH Pulmonary Care Center and Post CoViD Hub has the following services: multi-disciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation program; comprehensive diagnostic assessment for chronic lung diseases and long CoViD syndrome; smoking cessation program; asthma education program; lung cancer and interstitial lung disease multi-disciplinary care; and hoe care referral network provision.It is under the Division of Pulmonary Medicine of UP-PGH headed by Dr. Lenora C. Fernandez, M.D. Aside from the country’s top pulmonologists, it boasts of a multi-disciplinary medical team from the UP-PGH’s Departments of Rehabilitation Medicine, Neurosciences, Family Medicine, and Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine. Respiratory therapists as well as the Medical Social Services and Dietary Section are also partners in dispensing the Hub’s services.The BusinessMirror provides readers with a broader look at today’s business in these challenging times.

The countries where open defection is most widespread have the highest number of deaths of children aged under five years as well as the highest levels of malnutrition, poverty, and huge disparities of wealth. In the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) recently conducted the celebration of World Toilet Day as one of the 17-part community engagement called “Biyaheng Kalusugan” where the DOH aims to provide practical knowledge on how to practice the “7 Healthy Habits para sa Healthy Pilipinas.”The caravan activities conducted November 18, 2023 at GMALL Cebu City aimed to boost Zero Open Defecation (ZOD) campaign.IT consisted of a comic book billboard discussing the importance of having ZOD communities, a game booth imparting knowledge on proper hygiene and sanitation, and a photowall where all participants can seal their commitment to contribute towards a safe and clean environment. “Biyaheng Kalusugan: World Toilet Day” was attended by Director Alethea De Guzman of the DOH Epidemiology Bureau, Director Ana Liza Hombrado-Duran of the DOH Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, Acting Mayor of Cebu City Raymond Alvin Garcia, and Cebu City Health Officer Dr. Daisy Villa. “Healthy communities where there is access to safe water and sanitation facilities ensure that we are protected from illnesses, such as diarrhea, that may lead to hospitalization and death,” De Guzman said.Yet, she added, there is still a significant number of Filipino households which lack access to basic toilet facilities. “This World Toilet Day, we wanted to impart behaviors we should practice that will protect us and our families—wash our hands, properly prepare food, drink from reliable water sources. We also call on our local government units and health partners to invest towards the establishment and improvement of sanitation infrastructures for a safe and clean environment,” she said.The Biyaheng Kalusugan initiative and celebration of World Toilet Day is in line with the Department’s Eight-Point Action Agenda particularly to Agenda #5: Pag-iwas sa sakit and Agenda #6: Ginhawa ng isip at damdamin. THESE aim to increase comprehensive health literacy among Filipinos and to create healthy communities wherein the physical, psychological, social, political, and economic factors are promotive and protective of health and where healthcare is available, relevant, and accessible to the public. “Poor sanitation not only poses health risks but also hinders the progress we made towards realizing Universal Health Care,” Health Secretary Teodoro J. Herbosa said.“Let us seize this opportunity to create lasting change and ensure that every Filipino has access to safe and dignified sanitation facilities all geared towards creating healthier settings and choices for everyone,” he added.The DOH also encourages the continued support and investment of its partners in the public and private sector to enable sustainable uptake of healthy behaviors for all Filipinos.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/23/vaccination-drive-key-to-fighting-pneumonia-in-children-seniors/,"Vaccination drive key to fighting pneumonia in children, seniors","In May 2022, medical experts led by researchers from the local educational and foreign organizations said it was high time to conduct a thorough review of the 10-year-old pneumonia vaccine strategy to reduce the mortality rate among children as pneumonia is one of the leading causes of death among children.As of last year, the Philippines is in the fifth spot with the most number of pneumonia deaths.In a recent forum, Dr. Lulu Bravo, executive director of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination (PFV) said the Philippines is one of the top zero dose countries for children in vaccination. “This makes the Philippines a source of outbreaks of diseases,” Bravo told the audience in a recent a multi-stakeholder media forum organized by MSD titled “Advance the Fight Against Pneumonia” held in Mandaluyong City.IT was quite different 30 years ago when the Department of Health was headed by the late senator Juan Flavier, according to Bravo. “It was the golden period of immunization. Under Secretary Flavier, 8 million children eight years old and below were vaccinated during the month of April. We need to trust our leaders again,” Bravo pointed out.Through his wit, charm, and folksy humor, Flavier was able to successfully implement the health programs of the Ramos administration that resonated to the public through simple and effective messages. Bravo also urged the public to avoid and be vigilant against the so-called DOMs (disinformation, opportunism and misinformation) in undermining the effectiveness of the vaccines.Professor Kim Mulholland, founder of the Global Action Plan Pneumonia Research Institute, said spreading fake news on the vaccines happens worldwide as rightwing conspiracy theorists issue outlandish and ridiculous theories against the vaccines.“Backsliding is a problem we have to face caused by negative propaganda,” he said. AS they say, “an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.”Bravo lamented that some medical practitioners do not value vaccination. “Perhaps, they were not educated enough in the value of prevention during their student days in medical school,” she pointed out. She said one can significantly lower their risk of contracting pneumonia through immunization. It is highly recommended for people at greater risk of catching pneumonia, namely infants under two years old, older adults over 65 years old, people with weakened or compromised immune systems, and people with chronic health conditions that affect the heart and lungs.The Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (PSMID) recommends adults 50 years old and above to get immunized with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPSV) or pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) to prevent invasive pneumococcal diseases.THE good news is, people can now secure their pneumococcal vaccinations from multiple access points, from hospitals and clinics, and at pharmacies and community drug stores as well. Jennifer Flores, a member of the Philippine Pharmacists Association, said the Immunizing Pharmacist Certification Program of the Philippine Pharmacists Association (PPhA) will enable pharmacists to be trained and certified to become immunizing pharmacists, expanding the network of allied healthcare professionals pushing forward the fight against pneumonia.Further, Filipinos aged 60 years old and above can get their pneumonia shots for free at the barangay health centers (BHCs) of their local government units (LGUs). This was made possible through the National Immunization Program (NIP) of the Department of Health (DOH). Pneumonia is usually the result of a pneumococcal infection, caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other different types of bacteria can also cause pneumonia, as well as viruses and, more rarely, fungi. Once a person is infected, this bacterial infection can cause swelling or inflammation of the tissues in one or both of our lungs. Symptoms of pneumonia develop within 24 to 48 hours and may include coughing, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, and chest pains. IT remains a leading cause of death among older adults and people with chronic diseases. In the Philippines, pneumonia was the sixth leading cause of death in 2022, according to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).The forum also facilitates expert talks and multi-stakeholder discussions about the challenges and opportunities surrounding pneumonia prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in the Philippines. World Pneumonia Day, celebrated every November 12, is a yearly reminder that pneumonia is a life-threatening disease that can strike anyone, anytime, anywhere. The annual event not only draws more awareness to this severe lung infection, but also drives a whole of society approach to combat this highly preventable disease.Image credits: Rizal Raoul S.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/23/multi-sectoral-group-intensifies-information-drive-against-diabetes/,Multi-sectoral group intensifies information drive against diabetes,"‘The diabetics of the future will be the adults of tomorrow,” said Dr. Ricardo Fernando.The late Dr. Ricardo Fernando is credited for his pioneering efforts in spreading awareness on the treatment of diabetes in the Philippines.Inspired by their founder Dr. Fernando, Dr. Elizabeth Catindig, Executive Director of the Institute for Studies on Diabetes Foundation Inc., said the school is building partnerships with medical societies to spread awareness to the public on the challenges of diabetes in the country.“As an educational institution, we have the luxury of having graduates from Batanes to Jolo. Part of our curriculum is education. We are fully aware that almost anywhere, proper education should not only be given to patients but also their families,” Catindig said during a press briefing during the celebration of the recently concluded celebration of World Diabetes Day held in Quezon City.ALTHOUGH the Internet provides a lot of information on different health products for diabetics, Catindig also urged patients to consult their doctor first to ensure they will be using the proper prescriptions. Danish Ambassador to the Philippines Franz-Michael Mellbin said Denmark is an active partner of the Philippines in the treatment of diabetes. Meanwhile, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk urged diabetes patients, families, caregivers, and stakeholders to understand the importance of these factors in tackling the disease. “The collaboration between the Royal Danish Embassy and Novo Nordisk Philippines is a testament to the power of shared knowledge and best practices. Our joint commitment to ‘knowing,’ knowing your risk, knowing your response, serves as the foundation for our efforts to bring the best of Danish healthcare support to the Filipino people. We stand united in our mission to enhance diabetes care and promote a healthier future for all,” said Melbin. NOVO Nordisk Philippines, together with its partners, emphasized the significance of recognizing the risk of Type 2 diabetes. Understanding this risk can play a pivotal role in delaying or preventing the condition and addressing the consequences of diabetes-related complications. According to the World Health Organization, approximately one in 10 adults worldwide has diabetes, with over 90 percent affected by Type 2 diabetes, and nearly half of these cases remain undiagnosed.“Our dedicated Quezon City Health Department is the frontline for public health, taking concrete steps not only in diabetes prevention but also in detection, screening, and treatment. With 66 health centers providing free medicines for indigent citizens dealing with high blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol, we ensure that no one is left behind in their healthcare journey,” Mayor Joy Belmonte said.Apart from pharmaceutical care, medical organizations also play a role in paving the way for a future where people living with diabetes have a better quality of life. “Novo Nordisk Philippines continually drives initiatives such as this event to raise awareness about diabetes. Globally, this year also marks our 100 years, and we renew our commitment to drive change for a healthy world today, and for generations to come,” Dr. Neslie Buena-Bobis, Clinical, Medical, Regulatory and Pharmcovigilance Director said.“We strive to offer improved access to diabetes management, equipping individuals with the knowledge and resources needed to lead healthier lives. We created a website where people can find the tools and information they need to take charge of their diabetes journey. We want to empower people living with diabetes, so they can better manage their health. Our commitment to innovation and access to treatments and information drives us forward on the path toward a healthier, diabetes-resilient future,” Dr. Neslie Buena-Bobis added.NOVO Nordisk Philippines, in collaboration with the local government of Quezon City, the Royal Danish Embassy Manila, South Star Drug, and key medical organizations, spearheaded the Global Diabetes Walk in the Philippines. Themed “Walk for Change,” the event emphasizes the importance of taking steps to prevent diabetes. The Global Diabetes Walk is a worldwide initiative dedicated to raising diabetes awareness and promoting healthy lifestyles, presenting an opportunity for people worldwide to unite to support those affected by diabetes and advocate for measures to prevent and manage this disease. Communities worldwide will join walks to demonstrate solidarity with those living with diabetes. In line with WDD’s theme on diabetes education, the initiative offers an opportunity to enhance one’s knowledge of diabetes, connect with others in the community, and show support for those affected by the condition. By taking part in these walks, individuals can contribute to the global effort to combat this growing public health issue. For individuals living with diabetes, Mariel Crisostomo, South Star Drug General Manager, stressed access to accurate information, the right medicines, and self-care tools is critical to delaying or preventing complications. She added healthcare professionals also play a crucial role, requiring access to adequate training and resources to detect complications early and provide optimal care.Image credits: Rizal Raoul S.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/23/phl-govt-urged-to-develop-time-bound-plan-to-eliminate-cervical-cancer/,PHL gov’t urged to develop time-bound plan to eliminate cervical cancer,"The Philippine Cervical Cancer Elimination Movement urges the Philippine government to strengthen current public health efforts under the National Integrated Cancer Control Program (NICCA) through bilateral health cooperation, and public-private partnerships, within the framework of a national action plan that will further clarify and follow-through on commitments.This follows the recent US-Indonesia declaration of a strategic partnership for health, with the leaders of the two countries holding a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit and issuing a joint statement reiterating their shared commitment to strengthening prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, including cancer, and particularly their shared intent to eliminate the incidence of cervical cancer. U.S. President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., who met with Indonesian President Joko Widodo in Washington, D.C. on Nov. 13, announced that the United States “welcomes and supports Indonesia’s Declaration on Cervical Cancer Elimination through the National Cervical Cancer Elimination Plan (2023-2030).”Indonesia’s plan builds upon the country’s progress toward the World Health Organization’s (WHO) global strategy for cervical cancer elimination, launched in November 2020 with targets set for 2030, and the APEC Cervical Cancer Roadmap (2021-2025). Notably the WHO global strategy aims to achieve three targets: fully vaccinate 90% of girls with the HPV vaccine by the age of 15; screen 70% of women by age 35 and again by age 45; and treat 90% of women with pre-cancer and manage 90% of women with invasive cancer. In line with this, Indonesia’s national plan sets even more ambitious targets: vaccinate 90% of both girls and boys; screen 75% of women aged 30 to 69 using HPV-DNA testing; and treat/manage 90% of women diagnosed with pre-cancer and invasive cancer by 2030.Eliminating cervical cancer is part of the APEC vision for women and girls to live healthy and productive lives. The APEC Health Working Group reported earlier in March that although APEC economies have made progress toward the WHO 90-70-90 targets, none have reached all three targets for vaccination, screening, and treatment. The 21 countries appear to be most successful in reaching targets for cervical cancer treatment; however, to reduce disease incidence, the working group proposed increasing investment and uptake of vaccination and screening to prevent cervical cancer from occurring.With its plan in place, Indonesia could serve as a model for other nations to fully commit to cervical cancer elimination. Indonesia’s efforts will also benefit from its partnership with the US, which aims to foster greater collaboration across multiple health sectors, including through a planned five-year renewal of the memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Indonesia’s Ministry of Health. “We laud Indonesia’s commitment and clear declaration of the government on eliminating cervical cancer. The Philippines is also one with APEC in its vision for women and girls to live healthy and productive lives by ensuring that the threat of cervical cancer and HPV is eliminated. That is why our government is currently implementing several health programs in support of prevention and control of non-communicable diseases like cancer, which we believe can be further strengthened through a whole-of-society approach and public-private partnerships,” said Alvin Manalansan, Co-Convenor of the Philippine Cervical Cancer Elimination Movement.“We hope that the Philippine Government can likewise issue a definitive statement on cervical cancer elimination, with targets and clear timelines. In doing so, we hope that the Philippines and the US will similarly enhance and further strengthen their cooperation on prevention, screening/diagnostics, and treatment of cervical cancer, as well as research and development , technical collaboration, investment in human capital development, and the sharing of best practices,” Mr. Manalansan added.The Philippines has a population of 39.6 million women ages 15 years and older who are at risk of developing cervical cancer. Every year, 7,897 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 4,052 die from the disease. It is the second most frequent cancer among women in the Philippines and the 2 most frequent cancer among women between 15 and 44 years old.The Philippine Cancer Elimination Movement works with various stakeholders to raise awareness on the prevention, treatment, and cure of cervical cancer."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/23/sanofi-pcedm-team-up-to-give-used-insulin-pens-a-new-life/,"Sanofi, PCEDM team up to give used insulin pens a new life","– According to a 2021 study by Science Advances, the Philippines is the #1 country contributing to ocean plastic, with an estimated ocean plastic waste generation of over 350,000 metric tons. Since the country is dependent on marine biodiversity for food, tourism, and livelihood, conservation and preservation of the Philippine seas are top priorities for the government.On World Diabetes Day, November 14, 2023, global innovative healthcare company Sanofi and the Philippine College of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism (PCEDM) signed a partnership agreement to further implement plastic waste management in their operations, and support the government’s environmental priorities through the project.“PCEDM and Sanofi believe that environmental sustainability is a collective effort. We aim to lessen the amount of waste from healthcare products, and give used insulin pens a new purpose through a simple yet effective process, which is a great way to start,” Dr. Marjorie Ramos, PCEDM President, said.As of 2021, there are over 4 million total cases of diabetes among Filipino adults, and a portion of whom use insulin pens for treatment. Together with other plastic waste, insulin pens may end up in landfills and get thrown into the ocean, if improperly disposed. Through the project, people with diabetes who use insulin pens will now be able to drop off their empty pens in designated collection bins at any PCEDM-accredited hospital. These discarded pens will then be collected and downcycled into eco-bricks that can be used for the construction of garden pathways and pavements. While there are currently 10 PCEDM-accredited training hospitals, including the Philippine General Hospital, Cardinal Santos Medical Center, and the University of Santo Tomas Hospital, in Metro Manila and Cavite, PCEDM and Sanofi are looking to expand the project to more hospitals to cater to more patients.“At Sanofi, our dedication to improving people’s lives goes beyond innovations in healthcare,” said Janet Yap, Country Lead and General Manager, General Medicines Foundation at Sanofi Philippines. “As a global organization, we also take active responsibility in caring for our planet as much as we can. With PCEDM and through the project, we hope to contribute to the protection of our marine biodiversity by reducing our environmental footprint.”The BusinessMirror provides readers with a broader look at today’s business in these challenging times.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/23/herbalife-nutrition-marks-29-years-of-healthy-living-through-activities/,Herbalife Nutrition marks 29 years of healthy living through activities,"Herbalife Nutrition recently celebrated its 29th year of commitment to promote the importance of living a healthy lifestyle, fostering community engagement, and giving back to the community.“Everything is more fun if you celebrate it with the community. That’s the whole essence of who we are as a company,” Herbalife Nutrition General Manager Allan Domingo told BusinessMirror.Aside from the engagement of distributors, families and friends and all the other prospects, Domingo said all of these go back to contributing health and wellness to the community.Health enthusiasts, fitness fanatics and people of all ages gathered for a day to participate in the “Live Your Best Life Herbalife Run 2023” at the Marikina Sports Complex. Participants had the option to choose to do a leisurely 3K walk to a challenging 5K run, catering to runners and walkers of varying abilities.THE participants tracked their progress in real-time by using the Herbalife Run App. This technology-driven feature added an element of excitement and competition, as participants could monitor their performance and strive for their personal best.“It’s actually a brand new app that we continued to improve ever since we transitioned from the virtual run to now the Herbalife Run,” Domingo underscored.The Herbalife Run recognized and rewarded 100 participants from both the 3K and 5K runs, presenting them with prizes from Herbalife.According to Domingo, the Herbalife Run was more than just a race; it was a holistic experience that featured different games and entertaining activities on field, ensuring that participants were constantly engaged and entertained.Another highlight of the day was the “Shake to the Groove” session where participants got the chance to showcase their dancing skills while learning about trending dance moves. A special “Kids Corner” was set up, keeping the young ones active and involved in the celebration.BEYOND promoting an active lifestyle, the Live Your Best Life Herbalife Run 2023 also extended its community involvement through a charitable component called Herbalife Nutrition Foundation (HNF) and partnered with Tuloy Foundation Inc. (Tuloy sa Don Bosco) and the SOS Children’s Village.Domingo said that “for every run kit that you buy, which consists of our products, and some merchandise, a portion of that is actually donated to Herbalife Nutrition Foundation.”“We’re not only here to just do business, [but to] contribute to the community in general,” he said.The event supported the HNF, which aims to provide and support programs addressing nutrition, education, community development and disaster relief efforts. Domingo believes that participants should be proud of the fact that their involvement contributed to a noble cause.“We’re actively looking for partners every time,” he said. “In terms of expansion, we do have programs that we do with our distributors that can enable them to contribute to the community in their own way.”WHEN asked about future plans as Herbalife approaches its three decades in the Philippines, Domingo remained tight-lipped on details but hinted at a grand celebration. “Next year is going to be big. We’re going to celebrate it in a bigger way,” he stated.“This is our 29th year, and next year is going to be a lot bigger,” Domingo exclaimed. “We’re proud to announce the presence of the renowned American football team, the LA Galaxy, in our celebrations.”Highlighting their association with football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo as a brand ambassador, Domingo revealed, “We’re welcoming five or six LA Galaxy players to join our fitness event, celebrating with our members in a fun and active way.” The celebration will extend beyond the fitness event, with visits to Casa Herbalife and a special tour of Metro Manila for the LA Galaxy players.“At the end of the day, we always celebrate our anniversary with our members, thanking them for contributing to our community,” Domingo emphasized."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/22/pastoralists-have-raised-livestock-in-harsh-climates-for-millennia-what-can-they-teach-us-today/,Pastoralists have raised livestock in harsh climates for millennia. What can they teach us today?,"SUKHBAATAR, Mongolia — The half-crescent moon glowed in the predawn sky as Agvaantogtokh and his family began preparing for yet another big move with their animals.On horseback, he rode to a well with nearly a thousand sheep and goats. Occasionally, he and his wife, Nurmaa, stopped to help struggling young ones, weak after a harsh winter — putting a lamb in the warm comfort of a van and hand-feeding a foal rejected by its mother. The animals would need strength for the trek eastward across vast, hilly grasslands.Thousands of miles away in Amadou Altine Ndiaye’s family led livestock through a sparse African savannah dotted by acacia trees and brush. Horses and donkeys pulled a four-cart caravan along dirt paths in sweltering heat. Cattle followed behind. Ndiaye brought up the rear, wearing a traditional conical hat and contorting his mouth to make sounds only he and his animals could understand.They were traveling from the town of Nayde in the northeast to a village even further east — they believed it would be richer with vegetation. Ndiaye, a member of the Muslim Fulani ethnic group, learned the ways of animal herding alongside his elders.“I was born into pastoralism, and since then I’ve known only that. There were cattle and sheep present at my birth,” the 48-year-old said. “It’s a source of pride.”More than 50 million people in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere practice and treasure this way of life. As nomadic pastoralists, they keep domestic animals and move with them to seek fresh pastures — often selling some of their livestock for meat.______Although nomadic pastoralism has sustained these populations for millennia, it faces mounting pressures from , shrinking rangelands, and new generations who seek a less grueling and tenuous life. At the same time, pastoralism is modernizing, with groups leveraging new technology to better care for their animals.But the practice has survived for so long because it is designed to adapt to a changing environment — pastoralists move with their animals to find fresh pasture and water, leaving behind fallow land to heal and regrow. “The broad view is that having mobile animals enables you to leave places that are overused or that have scarce water or food resources and move to places where there are more resources,” said Forrest Fleischman, who researches natural resource policy at the University of Minnesota. “And that means you’re not going to hammer the one place you’re stuck in.”Experts say it is a lesson that could help those who raise livestock at much larger scales adapt and reduce the impact of animal agriculture on the environment. Pastoralists aren’t only trying to outrun climate change; they’re combatting it.“They have the Indigenous knowledge,” said Edna Wangui, a geography professor who studies the practice at Ohio University. “There is a lot we can learn.”Perhaps more than any other place, Mongolia is known for pastoralism. The practice is enshrined in the nation’s constitution, which calls its 80 million camels, yaks, cows, sheep, goats and horses “national wealth” protected by the state.For families like Agvaantogtokh’s, pastoralism is more than a profession. It’s a cultural identity that connects generations across time. And at its heart is the human connection to animals.Agvaantogtokh and his family sell animals for meat. They also sell dairy products such as yogurt and hard cheeses. While they consider the animals their property, they also see them as living beings working alongside them for a common purpose.Researchers say herders believe in “animal agency.” Agvaantogtokh lets his livestock pick what grass, flowers or herbs they eat, and find their own water. To him, fencing an animal and asking it to eat the same thing every day is like putting a person in prison.Weather extremes are a part of life in Mongolia, and managing them is increasingly difficult as the environment changes. When Agvaantogtokh thinks about climate change, he worries about what it means for humans and livestock.One spring day, he felt the wind whip up and watched blue skies turn menacingly dark. In the distance, he spotted a wall of dirt rushing toward him.“Dust storm,” he muttered. His father, Lkhaebum, left a bowl of soup half-eaten on the table. Both set off on motorbikes to make sure their animals were safe.“We need more rain,” said Lkhaebum, who like other Mongolians uses only his given name. “If the grass isn’t growing, it is very challenging for us.”Chronic drought plagues Mongolia. So does warming. Since 1940, the country’s government says, average temperatures have risen 2.2 degrees Celsius (nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit) — a measure that may seem small, but for global averages, scientists say every tenth of a degree matters, and a warming world brings more weather extremes.And dzuds — natural disasters unique to Mongolia caused by droughts and severe, snowy winters — have grown harsher and more frequent and can keep livestock from accessing water or food.A dzud pushed Agvaantogtokh and his family to move out of a southwestern province after a disastrous winter killed 400 of their animals. They’ve been in the eastern province of Sukhbaatar since 2020.The family lives simply. They have a sink with a rubber pump to limit water use. They live in a tent called a ger, which has wooden circular frames insulated with sheepskin and felt, and doors facing east to let in the morning sun.Nurmaa, who married into this way of life, uses a boiler fired with horse dung to cook and stay warm.“Year by year,” she said, “I have learned a lot of things.” Herding and birthing animals. Helping set up camp. Cooking big meals of breads, stews, milk tea and homemade wine.But every place the family moves its ger, she has a sense of a settled life.Each belonging is systematically placed in the same spot — something stable and predictable in a world of constant change.In Senegal, caravans carry the comforts of a furnished home, such as a metal bed frame and mattress, and water for people and animals.With the rainy season approaching earlier this year, Ndiaye, his son-in-law Moussa Ifra Ba and the rest of the family prepared for a 170-kilometer (106-mile), 16-day trek.Water and plentiful grass have become harder to come by. “One of the main difficulties related to pastoralism is the lack of grazing,” Ndiaye said. “The livestock are hungry, and you sometimes have trouble selling one because it is so thin.”“Many varieties of tree have disappeared, and even our children are unaware of certain species,” Ba said. “The best varieties of grass no longer grow in certain areas, and the most widespread grass is more like rubber: It fills the belly but doesn’t nourish the animals.”Meals for Ndiaye’s family rarely include meat and are carefully planned. Only when they pass through certain villages can they stock up on food — vegetables, rice and other essentials.Overall, per-person meat consumption in Senegal is among the lowest in the world; rates are more than six times higher in Mongolia.Ndiaye’s family doesn’t sell their animals regularly because meat is mostly for special occasions: weddings, or holidays such as Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr. When they do, a few head of cattle can provide enough money to get married, buy rice or even emigrate.The family has the same deep respect for their animals that Mongolian pastoralists do. Ba is especially drawn to the sheep. He’s noticed that the rams cry when they move away from him, remember the names he gives them and come when they’re called.“It’s a real friendship,” Ba said.In their four-cart caravan, young people and young animals both get special care.Ndiaye’s 5-year-old daughter, Aminata, and 2-year-old granddaughter, Aissata, ride atop one cart with the women. In another, baby sheep too young to walk for long in the heat are bound together with netting.Ba said he can’t imagine any other life: “A village without cows has no soul.”To keep their practice alive, pastoralists around the world are looking for ways to modernize.In Mongolia, Lkhaebum recently began using a motorbike to more easily search for horses, which are never kept fenced. One nippy morning, his calf-length tunic billowed around him as he began a search, stopping occasionally to peer through binoculars toward a herd grazing on a faraway hill.The family also has a solar-powered battery that runs a television and washing machine, a karaoke machine, and a cellphone to keep track of weather and access Facebook groups where herders exchange information.“We now have 4G cellular data, and it helps us a lot in communicating and getting forecasts,” Nurmaa said. “It really helps us a lot with communicating with our children because they’re far away.”Their 18-year-old daughter studies medicine in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar. Their two younger children, a 13-year-old son and a 9-year-old daughter, are in school. The son spoke about becoming a herder when he was in his early teens. But not anymore.“I won’t regret anything if my child won’t be a herder,” Nurmaa said. “I would like them to do what they aspire to do.”Her view is not unusual.“If you asked parents, very few of them want their children to grow up to be pastoralists,” professor Wangui said. “They want their children to be something else because they’re seeing the life of pastoralists is a tough life.”Though modern tools promise to make things easier, many pastoralists run into obstacles. Those in Senegal, for example, often struggle to find signals for their cell phones. They rely mostly on older technology and methods.One evening, Ndiaye’s grown daughter, Houraye, peeled onions for the family’s meal, stirring a pot of rice illuminated by the glowing embers of her fire. When it was ready, her seven relatives gathered under the stars with small flashlights and turned on the handheld radio they charge off their solar panel. The bleating of sheep nearly drowned out the traditional melodies.An important advancement in infrastructure has helped the family: water towers known as forages that have sprung up with government assistance. Previously, finding water could require a 35-kilometer (22-mile) trek. Now, the family plots trips along the path of these towers, where they can refill their jugs and replenish their animals in long troughs.Still, some leaders don’t offer help to pastoralists. Conflicts between herders and settled farmers also can erupt surrounding land use and access to water.A few advocacy groups advise pastoralists to choose settled lives for their own good. In Senegal’s Sahel region — where the United Nations estimates 65% of meat and 70% of milk sold at local markets come from pastoralists — the head of the Association for Promoting Livestock Farming in the Sahel and Savannah suggests people put their children in school and diversify incomes.“Climate change has caused enormous damage, and people are not aware of the dangers that lie ahead,” said Moussa Demba Assette Ba. “If you invest all your income in livestock and disaster strikes, you lose everything, and that’s what climate change can do.”The former pastoralist built a home in 2006 that has since turned into a sprawling compound that provides solar power to neighbors. He encourages others to settle down as he has and seek ways to increase the quality, not quantity, of their animals.But perhaps the biggest threat to pastoralism comes from within, as the next generation chooses other paths.Four of Ndiaye’s seven living children don’t travel with their parents. He relies on help from Ba and a paid family friend to direct the animals to their destination.Ba, 28, and his wife Houraye, 20, have a 2-year-old daughter and want to expand their family. They mused about a future in which at least one child stays in pastoralism while at least one goes to school.“I’d like my children to keep up with the changing world,” Ba said.___"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/22/bong-go-pushes-multifaceted-strategy-as-he-flags-rising-hiv-cases-in-teens/,Bong Go pushes multifaceted strategy as he flags rising HIV cases in teens,"SEN. Christopher “Bong” Go, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Health, expressed his concern over the reported alarming increase in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases in the Philippines, particularly among teenagers.Responding to questions about the increasing HIV infections in a recent interview after aiding fire victims in Davao City, Go emphasized the need for a comprehensive and multi-disciplinary approach to tackle this growing health crisis.“First of all, this is alarming. HIV cases are rising again. As chairman of the Committee on Health, we will focus on this,” stated Go.He highlighted the importance of educating the youth about sex, teenage pregnancy, illegal drugs, and alcoholism as a primary step in addressing this issue.Go underscored the role of discipline and awareness in combating the spread of HIV.“Discipline is needed here. An education campaign is important … The approach should not be haphazard. It should be multidisciplinary,” he added.Treating HIV as both a health and behavioral concern is crucial, he added. He noted that Department of Health (DOH) programs, including hospitals and Regional Specialty Centers focusing on infectious diseases, play a crucial role.Go also principally sponsored Republic Act 11959, also known as the Regional Specialty Centers Act, signed into law by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr., on August 24.The law mandates the establishment of regional specialty centers within existing DOH regional hospitals. It stands as a testament to the commitment of the government to uplift the nation’s health infrastructure.He said DOH programs, including hospital-based, HIV-related interventions will be addressed through the regional specialty centers, Go explained.He also discussed the critical role of Malasakit Centers in helping those affected by HIV, and encouraged them to seek help from these centers.Addressing the issue as a behavioral matter, Go stressed the importance of interventions at schools, health centers, and even within households. He also cited the Super Health Centers as a medium type of polyclinic where people, especially those in remote areas, can access government healthcare packages, including those for HIV prevention.Super Health Centers are designed to focus on primary care, consultation, and early detection, further strengthening the healthcare sector in the country, especially in grassroots communities.Free consultations would be handled by municipal health offices, local government units, and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) through its Konsulta program.Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa recently reported a near doubling of HIV cases this year, with almost half involving teenagers. The introduction of a more infectious HIV subvariant, as noted by infectious diseases specialist Dr. Edsel Salvaña, contributed to this surge.The rapid growth in HIV cases was discussed in a recent meeting between Herbosa and Vice President Sara Duterte, focusing on health literacy interventions.According to the United Nations, the Philippines has one of the fastest-growing HIV epidemics globally, dating back to 1984. DOH declared the epidemic a national emergency in 2017 due to the rapid rise in infections.Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/22/mohs-analytics-expands-its-range-of-diagnostic-home-test-kits/,MOHS Analytics expands its range of diagnostic home test kits,"HOME test kits proved their value during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic as there came a point when hospitals were turning away patients who needed to be tested and treated. The ability to get tested for Covid in the comfort, privacy and safety of the home helped symptomatics know their Covid status sooner, with accuracy similar to a rapid antigen test in a laboratory. A negative test ensured peace of mind; a positive test meant that necessary treatment can be done earlier.MOHS Analytics was one of the first to introduce rapid antigen tests for Covid in the Philippines. With the growing acceptance of home test kits as an essential tool for healthcare, MOHS Analytics set up an arm, MOHS Diagnostics MD to expand its line of globally accepted home test kits to include malaria, urinary tract infection, and dengue. Under development is a test for leptospirosis.MOHS Diagnostics has also introduced an ovulation test kit, which while not detecting disease, will also be a helpful tool for women who want to get pregnant.“MOHS has grown quickly by addressing market gaps and meeting consumer demand through highly innovative products,” says Chief Innovation Officer Don Paolo San. “Being attuned to the market helps us to deliver what is needed with game-changing technologies.”Timely detection of disease is crucial for effective health management and preventing the spread of disease. Diseases such as malaria, dengue, and leptospirosis can be fatal if not properly treated as soon as possible. MOHS Diagnostics Home Test Kits allow early identification of potential health concerns, enabling prompt action and care.But home test kits can only be effective if they are available, accessible, and affordable when needed.MOHS diagnostic test kits are available without prescription and at affordable prices at over 2,500 retail outlets nationwide, from giant national pharmaceutical chains to smaller regional chains.“There is a growing realization that disease detection can be quickly and accurately done at home such that the sick can start early treatment and prevent the spread of disease. We are making accurate and affordable self-tests accessible to the Filipinos and this is our contribution to the improvement of the healthcare system in the Philippines,” says MOHS CEO Mike Hortaleza.At the first symptom of illness, home test kits will provide the sick with essential health insights, without the need for travel or clinic visits. These empower the sick and their caregivers to make informed decisions about their well-being and to seek professional help as warranted.For more information on MOHS Diagnostics Home Test Kits and to purchase, visit our website at MOHS Diagnostic website or MOHS FB Image credits: The BusinessMirror provides readers with a broader look at today’s business in these challenging times.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/20/members-to-expect-higher-benefits-from-philhealth/,Members to expect higher benefits from PhilHealth,"The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) is set to adjust the rates of most of its benefit packages starting in 2024, which will result in increased financial coverage for Filipinos’ hospitalization expenses. The adjustment is prompted by the increasing costs of healthcare in the country brought about by inflation. It was in 2013 when the state insurer first implemented the case rate payment system wherein PhilHealth reimbursed a fixed amount for a specific medical condition or surgical case., Emmanuel R. Ledesma, Jr., PhilHealth President and Chief Executive Officer said.The case rates are likely to increase to a maximum of 30 percent across all cases. This is expected to lower out-of-pocket expenses of patients during hospitalization and in the availment of PhilHealth benefits for outpatient care.However, to minimize untoward inflationary effects after rate adjustments, PhilHealth said it will prescribe a cost-sharing mechanism wherein health facilities and the members will have fixed co-payment rates on top of what is being paid for by PhilHealth as the insurer. This way, health facilities will be more efficient in the use of resources to achieve desired health outcomes, while members can predict how much they should pay for amenities and other extra services availed of beyond those provided in basic or ward accommodations. Other strategies to control the untoward effects of this adjustment include measures to prevent insurance fraud and doctor moral hazard.the PhilHealth chief clarified. PhilHealth shall adopt a variable inflation adjustment across types of health facilities, which means that higher-level facilities shall get higher adjustments in rates up to a maximum of 30 percent.The upward adjustment in case rates is on top of the ongoing benefit expansion and rationalization that was already approved by the PhilHealth Board. Ledesma added. For 2023, PhilHealth has implemented the expansion of dialysis coverage to 156 sessions from the previous 90 sessions. It also rationalized the rates for conditions mostly availed of among Filipinos. Recently, it released its Circular 2023-0021 where it increased coverage for ischemic stroke from P28,000 to P76,000, and hemorrhagic stroke from P38,000 to P80,000. It is set to release a circular before year-end to widen its coverage for pneumonia high-risk from P32,000 to 90,100.The state health insurer also launched its Outpatient Mental Health Package in mid-October, and will soon launch a package for Severe Acute Malnutrition. It also started to enhance its various Z Benefits Packages. In 2024, Z Benefits for breast cancer shall likewise be expanded which will include coverage of targeted therapy of up to P1M per patient per year., Ledesma stressed."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/16/zeroing-in-on-keeping-our-key-organs-healthy-part-ii/,Zeroing in on keeping our key organs healthy: Part II,"LAST week, I started to share my learnings on self-care for the heart and brain from this practical, up-to-date and comprehensive guide on caring for each organ in our body from the resource titled “The Guide to Aging Slower: Your Body’s Complete Owner’s Manual” by . This week, let me continue with the lungs, skeleton and stomach.OUR lungs are a pair of breathing organs in our chest that remove carbon dioxide from and bring oxygen to our blood. It’s likely that you’ve heard that “just breathe” advice a lot recently. And while focusing on your inhalations is useful when you need to calm down, taking a proper breath is easier said than done—especially in a world that can be hard on the lungs.Chronic respiratory disorders are on the rise in women, and lung cancer has jumped dramatically in recent decades, according to the American Lung Association (ALA). Smoking is still the primary cause, but air pollution is a huge factor, too. A study from the Johns Hopkins University found that a diet rich in apples (and tomatoes) may help repair the lungs of ex-smokers by “slowing down the lung’s natural aging process, even if you never smoked,” says lead study author Vanessa Garcia-Larsen, PhD. Instead of downing your daily cup of joe, sip green tea instead. Not only has it been credited with helping improve brain function and heart health, but new research also shows that it may protect against pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive form of lung disease where scar tissue builds up and limits the body’s oxygen supply. People with severe asthma may have low vitamin D levels, and foods like milk, eggs and salmon all contain the essential vitamin. Eating more pink fish may help the little ones too: kids who added fatty fish to their diets had improved lung function after just six months, according to a clinical trial from La Trobe University in Sydney, Australia.Is vaping better for me than smoking? Many regular cigarette users turn to e-cigarettes to try to stop smoking, but there’s mixed evidence about how effective this practice is, and these products are not approved by the FDA as a cessation aid.“E-cigarettes may help some patients to quit smoking, but we recommend other methods of nicotine replacement, such as prescription medications or over-the-counter products such as skin patches, lozenges and gum,” says pulmonologist Humberto Choi, MD. If you do use e-cigarettes to kick the habit, it’s best to stop using them as soon as you feel confident you’ve beat it. While more research is needed to truly understand the long-term effects of vaping, most experts don’t recommend it. “Cigarettes are incredibly lethal. Vaping isn’t as harmful, but it certainly isn’t harmless,” says tobacco-control advocate Robin Koval.YOUR bones are the rigid support system made of collagen and calcium phosphate that help keep you upright and serve as a protective cage for your internal organs. Grow and strengthen them as much as possible throughout every decade. Investing some time and energy in your bone health will ultimately set you up for a longer, healthier life and a fitter, firmer body, says geriatrician Diane L. Schneider, MD, author of .According to the article, calcium and vitamin D work in tandem to protect your bones: calcium helps build them and slows the rate of loss, while vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Women in their 40s should get 1,000 mg of calcium a day, ideally from foods such as low-fat cheese, yogurt, milk, fatty fish like salmon, and leafy green vegetables. Vitamin D, on the other hand, is difficult to get from diet alone because few foods contain it (fish, eggs, and fortified products such as milk and cereal are good sources). It also advises to have your vitamin D level tested to see if you would benefit from a supplement. Chronic inflammation not only increases your risk of disease, but it can also harm your bones. “Inflammation negatively affects bone building by altering levels of cytokines, which are proteins released by cells that regulate bone remodeling” says Tonva Orchard, PhD, an associate professor of human nutrition at Ohio State University in Columbus. (Bone remodeling is the process of bones quietly and constantly breaking down and being rebuilt to help keep your skeleton strong.) You can both quell our inner fire and slash belly fat by avoiding foods that are high in added sugar or saturated fat, like pastries, cookies and red meat, as well as sugar-sweetened beverages. Instead, opt for fruits and veggies, lean proteins, and whole grains, Orchard says.OUR stomach is a sac built with muscular walls that is located between the esophagus and the first part of the small intestine. “The digestive system is amazingly complex,” says gastroenterologist Chris South, MD. The article advises to eat lots of plants—fruits and vegetables. Always keep good body hygiene and general sanitation. At the same time, it advises to put a little dirt in our hands to help train kids’ immune systems like gardening.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/16/astrazeneca-ac-healths-healthway-medical-network-join-forces-to-combat-cancer-2/,"AstraZeneca, AC Health’s Healthway Medical Network join forces to combat cancer","AstraZeneca Philippines and Healthway Medical Network have entered a memorandum of understanding to improve accessibility and availability of medicines for treatment and management of Filipino cancer patients.In the Philippines, cancer is the third leading cause of mortality, which accounted for 26,138 recorded death cases in the first half of last year. According to the Global Cancer Observatory data in 2020, there were over 153,000 new incidences of cancer in the country, being led by cases in breast, lung, colorectum, and prostate, respectively.Under this partnership, Healthway Medical Network, through the Healthway Cancer Care Hospital, will be the first healthcare provider in the country to pilot and implement the AZ Cares Patient Access Program, which provides cancer patients expanded access to the innovative medicines of AstraZeneca. The partnership also aims to enhance the the capability of healthcare professionals in managing patients with cancer and empower patients with cancer through patient support programs.According to Lotis Ramin, Country President of AstraZeneca Philippines, “In AstraZeneca, we aspire for a future where cancer is curable through our life changing medicines alongside solutions and partnerships that allow early detection, diagnosis and equitable cancer care for patients.”She added, “We are grateful to AC Health and Healthway Medical Network for this collaboration that allows access to life-saving cancer medicines, enhance the capability of healthcare professionals in managing cancer patients and empower patients through patient support programs. With AstraZeneca’s growing pipeline across different therapeutic areas, we look forward to continue building on this partnership with the whole of AC Health to revolutionize innovative and holistic patient care for Filipinos.”With over four general hospitals, 13 out-patient centers, and its upcoming Healthway Cancer Care Hospital, the first of its kind in the country, Healthway Medical Network seeks to provide cross-cutting end-to-end cancer care to its patients. The partnership with AstraZeneca aligns seamlessly with Healthway’s mission of providing accessible, patient-centric healthcare.“This collaboration embodies our commitment to providing holistic, patient-centered care,” said Jimmy Ysmael, President and CEO of Healthway Medical Network. “As the first hospital and clinics group to pilot and implement the AZ Cares Patient Access Program, we are excited to leverage our extensive network of hospitals, clinics, and physicians to deliver accessible and effective cancer solutions, making a lasting impact on the healthcare journey of countless Filipinos.”In addition to this partnership, AstraZeneca and AC Health have a history of coming together for transformative healthcare initiatives. Earlier this year, they launched the ACT Now program, focusing on early detection of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) related to Diabetes and Hypertension within the Healthway QualiMed hospital network and Healthway clinics. Notably, during the pandemic, AC the Health joined hands with AstraZeneca in a concerted effort alongside the government and other private sector partners to secure COVID-19 vaccines, underlining their shared commitment to public health.“Having worked closely during the pandemic to fight Covid, we’re pleased to team up once more with AstraZeneca on this groundbreaking collaboration to fight cancer,” stated Paolo Borromeo, President and CEO of AC Health. “Our shared commitment to improving healthcare underscores the importance of collective action. Working with like-minded partners, we aim to bring positive and lasting changes to the healthcare experiences of many Filipinos.”The MOU signing ceremony held last October 18, 2023 at the Healthway Cancer Care Hospital in Arca South, Taguig City, was attended by representatives of Healthway Medical Network and AstraZeneca Philippines."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/16/pharmacists-play-crucial-role-in-delivering-healthcare-to-diabetic-patients-expert/,Pharmacists play crucial role in delivering healthcare to diabetic patients–expert,"Pharmacists have a crucial role to play in delivering healthcare services to Filipinos especially to diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy (PN).“Pharmacists are an integral part of the healthcare team that can provide valuable support to patients with PN, yet often we are underutilized. Pharmacists are often the first point of contact and can drive early awareness of a patient’s condition, offer guidance on lifestyle modifications, and help optimize medication regimens,” said Dr. Kenny P Merin, Pharmacist and Assistant Vice President, Academics & Research of Lyceum of the Philippines University Davao – Philippines, in a recent online forum on #KNOWTHESIGNS Scientific Forum.The forum was part of the celebration of World Diabetes Day 2023 organized by Procter and Gamble (P&G) Health.Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is the result of damage to the nerves and impacts the quality of life of people as they are unable to go about their daily lives comfortably.In the question-and-answer session, Marin said pharmacists can also provide over-the-counter treatments (e.g., therapeutic dose of Neurotropic B vitamins) for PN symptom relief. “By actively engaging with patients and healthcare professionals, let’s join hands to improve PN patients’ long-term health and well-being,” said Merin.Marin said Filipinos have a high regard for pharmacists as they are the first professionals that people go to when they feel discomfort and sickness. He urged pharmacists to be proactive by asking diabetic or potentially diabetic patients questions about their symptoms such as tingling muscle weakness, burning sensation and numbness.“These are questions that you should ask as peripheral neuropathy is often undiagnosed by doctors in the Philippines. Oftentimes, patients do not pay too much attention to these symptoms which can be addressed if we are able to identify it early,” Marin explained.Marin said pharmacists can help specifically check if they are suffering from PN by testing the sensitivity of the fingers. All they need to use is a piece of cotton or tissue to touch the tip of the fingers of the patient if there are diminished sensation. A feather or a toothpick can also be used for the same purpose.If they experience any diminished sensation, a patient will be asked to take vitamin B complex and see a medical doctor for further assistance.To encourage more people to be health conscious, Marin stressed that pharmacists can also be both proactive and observant at the same time for their clients to check their conditions. He said they should be inquisitive and ask questions to specifically check for their progressions of their particular diseases.“Specifically, pharmacists can screen the abnormal symptoms particularly those who have abnormal sugar levels. If they find that, they can refer to a doctor if needed to have further tests,” he explained.He said pharmacists can also conduct medical test assessment specifically for patients diagnosed with diabetes and are taking their maintenance medicines. By focusing on diabetic patients. Marin said pharmacists can get a clearer picture if they are doing well or not.Lastly, it is important for pharmacists to identify patients with diabetes mellitus and check their disease progression and continue asking questions on peripheral neuropathy.He said there is a big opportunity for Filipino pharmacists in the Philippines to counsel their patients to preserve their nerve health. If the patients can catch it in the early stage, Marin said they can use vitamin B complex to promote their nerve health.With over a million Filipinos suffering from diabetic peripheral neuropathy, he said pharmacists recommended the following steps:Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 is the leading cause of PN and this is closely linked to the rise in the number of diabetic patients.Symptoms of PN include numbness, tingling, prickling, and burning sensations in the hands and feet. Vitamin B deficiency and polymedication are other high-risk factors along with diabetes, leading to peripheral nerve damage. Published studies across different countries confirm that up to 80 percent of patients with PN remain undiagnosed and untreated.Image credits: Rizal Raoul S.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/16/senior-citizens-urged-to-get-their-flu-vaccines-to-fight-flu-like-illnesses/,Senior citizens urged to get their flu vaccines to fight flu-like illnesses,"Health Undersecretary Enrique Tayag said the country must not let its guard down as he recently expressed concern over the 46 percent increase in influenza-like illnesses from the same period of last year.“This is greater than the 158,000 dengue cases in the country,” Tayag told reporters in a press conference held in Pasig City. Citing data from the National Health of Institute, Tayag lamented that only 35.6 percent of Filipinos aged 60 and above received pneumococcal vaccines this past year.To boost awareness of the importance of vaccines especially to the elderly, the Raising Awareness on Influenza to Support Elderlies (RAISE) Coalition called on elderly Filipinos to get vaccinated during its one-year anniversary and observation of World Pneumonia Day with a stakeholders’ forum at the Ortigas Center in Pasig City.The group is calling for the institutionalization and establishment of the month of May as the National Influenza Vaccination month to maximize the value of the program, provide protection before the peak of the flu and rainy seasons. Tayag added that the month of May is the most appropriate time as people are in a festive mode to interact and mingle.“We have to intensify the collaboration across sectors to implement better policy and program implementation of flu vaccination in the country,” Dr. Rontgene Solante, RAISE Convenor; Board Member-Philippine Foundation for Vaccination (PFV) noted in his video message. “Current policies and programs only protect the indigent elderly population. Our national flu vaccination program falls short of the World Health Organization’s VCR target of 75 percent at just eight percent.”Dr. Lulu Bravo, PFV Executive Director, underscored the urgency of timely vaccination for seniors, stressing that for two decades, the vaccination rate for the elderly has been quite slow.“Nevertheless, they are the most vulnerable who are can diseases in he the lungs, heart and kidneys. We get more vulnerable as we get older,” Bravo said in Filipino.Dr. Rose Capeding, RAISE co-convenor and PFV President, also highlighted the coalition’s goals moving forward, emphasizing a comprehensive vaccination program.“Our goal should not just be childhood vaccination, but life-course vaccination. At every stage of life, there should be vaccinations to protect us.” She also noted the need for legislation to expand free flu vaccination for all seniors. “We already have support from the Senate and the Congress, so we are hopeful that there will be free vaccination to all senior citizens,” she adds. This year, House Bill 2097 was passed by the special committee to expand the current Senior Citizens Act.Dr. Shelley Ann de la Vega, Director of the National Institute of Aging, underscored the importance of giving free vaccines to the senior citizens. “There is really an unequal distribution on who is receiving these vaccines. As much as possible, the vaccines need to be free. We don’t need a new law, but we are looking at a better implementation of RA9994 for our senior citizens.”“Our appeal to our seniors is do not forget your yearly influenza vaccine schedule and please visit our health centers to ask for the free flu vaccines. To our partners, we will go to every place where RAISE can make an impact,” expressed Tayag.In its first year, the RAISE coalition has successfully supported various LGU health initiatives and was able to vaccinate a total of 1,433 senior citizens against influenza through a partnership with RAISE.Capeding said the RAISE Coalition has achieved significant strides in their community outreach this year. In the coming year, she added the will work closely with more Local Government Units (LGUs) and legislative champions to advocate for the revision of the Expanded Senior Citizens Act, aiming to provide free flu vaccinations for all senior citizens in the country.Dr. Remedios Coronel, a member of the immunization committee and president of Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Inc (PSMID) said the various government agencies, medical organizations, and civil societies present committed to addressing the country’s high mortality rates for flu-related illnesses. She said they will work together to ensure the life-saving vaccines effectively reach elderly Filipinos every year. “No one should be left behind in the vaccination program of the country,” she said.Image credits: Rizal Raoul S.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/12/bong-go-bats-for-continuous-support-for-filipino-healthcare-workers/,Bong Go bats for continuous support for Filipino healthcare workers,"Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, has emphasized the critical need for ample government support for Filipino healthcare workers. He reminded the Department of Budget and Management, Department of Health, and other concerned agencies to ensure that allowances and benefits due to qualified HCWs are released in accordance with the law. During the Senate plenary session on Wednesday, November 8, Go questioned the delayed disbursement of the health emergency allowance and underscored its significance in providing immediate financial relief to healthcare frontliners.“We passed Republic Act 11712 which grants continuing benefits and allowances to public and private healthcare workers during public health emergencies, like COVID-19. Last July, the state of public health emergency due to COVID-19 throughout the Philippines has been lifted by President Marcos, sa kabila nito may mga healthcare workers pa na hindi nababayaran ang kanilang HEA o health emergency allowance,” Go cited. “Sa pag-iikot ko po ng bansa, may lumalapit sakin at ipinaparating na, ‘Sir, yung aming HEA ay hindi pa nila nababayaran, di pa namin natatanggap.’ Parati natin sinasabi na sila ang ating hero noong pandemya at hindi natin mararating ito kung hindi po dahil sa kanila,” he added. Go’s inquiry is particularly relevant, given that the government has set aside a substantial amount of P19.962 billion for public health emergency benefits and allowances in the 2023 national budget, covering both healthcare and non-healthcare workers. Furthermore, an additional P52.962 billion in unprogrammed funds is allocated for the potential compensation of healthcare professionals.Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara said that P19.6 billion has already been disbursed from the programmed funds, while an additional P4 billion has been allocated from the unprogrammed funds.Meanwhile, Go questioned the rationale behind the approval of only a specific portion of the proposed P66.3 billion 2024 Department of Health (DOH) budget for the compensation of COVID-19 workers in health facilities.Go then stressed that these frontliners have incurred various expenses in the line of duty, often at great personal cost. Delayed or insufficient allowance payments would only compound the hardships they face, leaving them feeling undervalued and unsupported, he added. “I would like to appeal to DBM to release sufficient funds for the healthcare workers’ allowances. This is to ensure that our modern-day heroes get the allowances that they are entitled to. This is just a small incentive for our frontliners,” Go acknowledged. Furthermore, Go expressed support for the proposed salary increase for public sector workers possibly through an enactment of a Salary Standardization Law 6 (SSL 6), building upon the success of its predecessor, SSL 5 which Go authored and co-sponsored in 2020 that provided increased compensation for all government workers, including healthcare professionals in the public sector.Go likewise introduced Senate Bill No. 427, known as the Barangay Health Workers (BHWs) Compensation Bill.

Ledesma, Jr. announced. The said discounts are mandated under Republic Acts 9994 or the Expanded Senior Citizens Act, and 10754 or the Expanded Benefits and Privileges of Persons with Disability Act. The application of these discounts is also provided in the health facilities’ Performance Commitment with PhilHealth.“We have to give whatever the law mandates. This is our responsibility to our members, and one of them is to ensure that their senior citizen or PWD privileges, whichever is applicable, are properly deducted from their hospital bills”, Ledesma asserted. However, in cases where a patient is an elderly and a PWD at the same time, only one discount shall apply. The state health insurer also clarified that the application of the deductions shall be in the following order: 12% VAT exemption, 20% senior citizens or PWD discount, then the PhilHealth benefits. “Yun pong balanse ang siya na lamang dapat bayaran ng pasyente kung mayroon pa. Kung ang ating senior citizen member ay na-admit naman sa mga pampublikong pasilidad ay wala na silang babayaran dahil sa aming No Balance Billing policy”, Ledesma reiterated, adding that this can be validated by checking their billing statements. Health facilities that fail to deduct these privileges may face penalties and sanctions, including fines and even suspension or revocation of accreditation as provided for in their Performance Commitment with PhilHealth. The state agency also encouraged members and concerned citizens to immediately report instances of non-deduction of these privileges to the Office for Senior Citizens Affairs in their respective local government units, or to the National Council for Disability Affairs. These can also be reported to PhilHealth Callback Channel 0917-898-7442 or to PhilHealth’s Facebook page @PhilHealthofficial and Twitter@teamphilhealth. “Igiit natin ang ating karapatan dahil ang mga ito ay itinakda ng mga batas.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/10/bong-go-reminds-filipinos-to-be-vigilant-as-measles-and-rubella-cases-surge/,Bong Go reminds Filipinos to be vigilant as measles and rubella cases surge,"Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, has urged Filipinos to remain vigilant as the country grapples with a surge in cases of measles and rubella despite a nationwide child-focused immunization drive against said diseases. “Nais kong magpaalala sa inyong lahat na maging maingat sa gitna ng pag-usbong ng mga kaso ng tigdas at rubella dito sa bansa. Suportahan natin ang kasalukuyang programa para sa pagbabakuna at mahalaga pa rin na tayo’y mag-ingat at maging mapanuri,” reminded Go. The “Chikiting Ligtas” immunization program, spearheaded by the Department of Health (DOH), aims to safeguard the health of Filipino children. It was conducted from May 2 to June 14, and successfully vaccinated approximately 84% of children against measles and rubella, making commendable progress in protecting the young population. Despite the immunization drive, the latest surveillance report from DOH is a cause for concern, with 1,823 cases of measles and rubella reported from January 1 to October 7. This represents an alarming increase compared to the 494 cases recorded during the same period the previous year. Of these cases, 1,731 were measles infections, and 92 were rubella. The surge has affected all 17 regions of the country, with the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) witnessing the most significant rise with 532 cases, marking a 3,992-percent increase from the 13 cases reported in 2022.BARMM is composed of the provinces of Basilan, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, and Cotabato City. Meanwhile, fatalities due to measles have also increased. Five deaths have been reported this year, with affected regions including CALABARZON (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon), Mimaropa (Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, and Palawan), Davao (Davao de Oro, Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental, and Davao Occidental), and BARMM.The senator then emphasized, “Do not let your guard down, even in the face of vaccination efforts.” He urged parents to ensure that their children are up to date with their immunizations and to consult healthcare professionals for guidance on vaccination schedules. Go also stressed the significance of community awareness and encouraged Filipinos to report suspected cases promptly.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive response to public health crises, Go mentioned that he has refiled his twin bills aimed at the establishment of the Philippine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Virology Science and Technology Institute of the Philippines (VIP).Should Senate Bill No. (SBN) 195 be enacted into law, it will mandate the creation of the CDC as the leading authority responsible for the development of initiatives pertaining to communicable disease control and prevention. Its primary duty will revolve around managing the prevention and containment of infectious diseases within the country.Additionally, Go has also introduced SBN 196, which aims to establish VIP. This institute will serve as the nation’s primary hub for virology research, laboratory investigations, and technical coordination among the various virology laboratories nationwide.“Bilang inyong chairman ng Committee on Health, dapat one-step ahead tayo. Kailangan mag-invest tayo sa ating healthcare system. Mayroon rin tayong isinusulong na mga bills, itong mga Center for Disease Control or National Disease Prevention Management Authority. Kasali ito sa Philippine Development Plan ni President Bongbong Marcos para mayroon tayong disease control at opisina na nakatutok dito sa mga infectious diseases,” Go mentioned. “At ito ring Virology Science and Technology Institute, sana pagdating ng panahon mayroon na tayong kakayahan na makagawa tayo ng sariling bakuna para makapaghanda tayo sa anumang pandemya na darating sa ating buhay,” he added. Moreover, Go emphasized the importance of accessible and quality healthcare for all Filipinos especially in the grassroots that is why he continues to advocate for the establishment of more Super Health Centers nationwide. He highlighted the critical role that Super Health Centers play in decongesting hospitals, facilitating early disease detection, and providing primary care, which includes vaccinations and medical consultations directly to the community. “Itong Super Health Center po, ang serbisyo diyan ay birthing o panganganak, dental, laboratory, ultrasound, at pati pagpapabakuna hindi lang kontra COVID-19, pati po sa tigdas. Kaya mas mapapaigting pa natin ang ating pagpapabakuna kontra measles at tigdas dahil ilalagay po ito sa mga strategic areas sa buong Pilipinas,” he continued. Super Health Centers shall offer basic medical services under one roof, such as database management, out-patient, birthing, isolation, diagnostic (laboratory: x-ray, ultrasound), pharmacy, and ambulatory surgical unit. Other available services in Super Health Centers are eye, ear, nose, and throat (EENT) service; oncology centers; physical therapy and rehabilitation center; and telemedicine, where remote diagnosis and treatment of patients will be done.Through the collective efforts of fellow lawmakers, sufficient funds had been allocated for 307 Super Health Centers in 2022 and 322 in 2023. The DOH, the lead implementing agency, identifies the strategic areas where they will be constructed.Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/09/early-detection-societal-support-needed-to-combat-cerebral-palsy-in-the-phl/,"Early detection, societal support needed to combat cerebral palsy in the PHL","MOST people already complain about pain and other forms of discomfort whenever they move their muscles, particularly the feet or to some, even their hands.More so if the individual has cerebral palsy.The Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation (CPARF) estimates that about 18 million people worldwide have this condition, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the US found one in every four cases of cerebral palsy for every 1,000 live births.Based on available data, about one to two percent of the population in the Philippines have cerebral palsy.THE CDC says cerebral palsy or CP “is a group of disorders that affect a person’s ability to move and maintain balance and posture, and is the most common motor disability in childhood. Cerebral means having to do with the brain, while palsy means weakness or problems with using the muscles. CP is caused by abnormal brain development or damage to the developing brain that affects a person’s ability to control his or her muscles.”The CDC, a major component of the US Department of Health and Human Services, noted four types of cerebral palsy, mainly spastic cerebral palsy, which is the most common as it affects about 80 percent of people with CP, whose muscles are seen as stiff and movements become awkward. There are different types of spastic CP as well, depending on the body part that is affected, like spastic diplegia/diparesis, where muscle stiffness mainly affects the legs; spastic hemiplegia/hemiparesis, which affects only one side of the body; and spastic quadriplegia/quadriparesis, said to be the most severe as it affects all four limbs, the trunk, and the face. Those with this type of CP, according to the CDC, usually cannot walk and possess other developmental disabilities like intellectual disability, seizures, or problems with vision, hearing, or speech.Those with Dyskinetic CP, on the other hand, have problems controlling the movement of their hands, arms, feet, and legs, making it difficult to sit and walk. Meanwhile, Ataxic CP is about problems on balance and coordination, and Mixed CP, the most common type is spastic-dyskinetic, is one whose symptoms are of more than one type of CP.Here in the Philippines, the Philippine Pediatric Society said there are about 2,993 cases of unspecified cerebral palsy cases, 426 of whom are spastic quadriplegics, 59 spastic diplegics, 33 dyskinetics, 10 are ataxics, and 190 were categorized as “others” although many may not be reported yet.THERE are several factors that lead to CP prevalence in the country, mainly due to lack of access to sufficient healthcare and support. Poor nutrition is also one, where malnutrition during pregnancy lead to brain damage in the fetus developing inside the body, thereby posing CP risks. Lack of prenatal care is also another factor since majority of women in the Philippines hardly receive prenatal care, which may also lead to birth complications or even injuries.The effects of CP on the body also varies depending on the severity and type, like difficulty with movement and coordination, muscle stiffness and tightness, speech and language and intellectual difficulties, plus other social and emotional challenges, particularly for children who try to deal with their condition.It is also essential that those with CP, despite their condition, should still be fully integrated into the mainstream of society, and should receive substantive medical care, physical therapy, and other support services for the management of their condition and more importantly, improve their quality of life.In a recent session online, Cerebral Palsied Association of the Philippines, Inc. (CPAP) President Charito Corazon Manglapus, said societal stigma has also forced some people with CP not to reveal their true condition, and said that CPAP is determined to reverse this somewhat prevailing perception.However, she pointed out the value of early intervention, combined with occupational therapy and special education, can enhance learning capacities based on individual functional levels of people diagnosed with CP.UNFORTUNATELY, CP is incurable according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) of the US, but certain treatments can help improve the capabilities of those with CP, particularly children. Although there is no standard therapy, consultations with specialists like a pediatric neurologist, developmental pediatrician, ophthalmologist, or otologist, can help in providing an accurate diagnosis and development of a specific treatment plan.There are also forms of therapies like physical, occupational, recreational, speech and language, and treatments for those who drool or have difficulty eating since they have little control over the muscles that cause movement in the jaw, mouth and tongue. Other treatments may involve medication, surgery, and the provision of assistive devices.ONE of those that consistently provide support to raising awareness and information about CP is SM Cares, the corporate social responsibility arm of SM Supermalls. Last month, the group partnered with the Cerebral Palsy Epilepsy Family Awareness Support Group.PH Inc. in celebration of World Cerebral Palsy Day. The group conducted a Hip Awareness workshop and physical check-up session at the SM Mall of Asia Arena Annex Building in Pasay City.The workshop aimed to orient, help, and guide parents of children with cerebral palsy and epilepsy on hip dysplasia, a congenital complication where the hip joint bones do not fit together properly. This condition makes affected children more prone to hip dislocation, which, in turn, affects their mobility and self-sufficiency.“If you have an unlimited number of ‘whys’ regarding what we are currently experiencing, it’s even more crucial that we engage in continuous contemplation about how and what we can do to ensure a better life and a beautiful future for our children,” said Cerebral Palsy Epilepsy Family Awareness Support Group.PH Inc. President and Founder, Jessa Marmol.For his part, SM Supermalls’ Senior Vice President for Operations and Director for SM Cares Program on Persons with Disabilities, Engr. Bien Mateo, said the event “marks a significant moment for us, not only because it’s the second year for us to host such an important event, but it also represents SM Supermalls’ ongoing commitment to raising awareness and providing support to our friends with cerebral palsy.”SM Cares is all about ‘Supporting Communities.’ In the spirit of social inclusion, we find ways to make our malls accessible and our frontliners assistive to individuals with cerebral palsy, as well as the families who care for them. We always will be a mall for all where no one gets left behind, and we hope that everyone will be able to enjoy the same fun and leisure in our malls,” Mateo added."

And I find that Filipinos tend to work long hours and sleep a few hours,” she pointed out.Dr. Wilson is a health visionary, researcher, bestselling author and international speaker. Through her research and clinical experience, she developed her Stress Recovery Protocol, which takes stress management to the next level by utilizing epigenetics to individualize the optimization of cortisol, adrenaline and neurotransmitters.She has a doctorate degree in naturopathic medicine from Bastyr University where she also completed her residency. She is also a certified midwife, a certified nutrition specialist and has degrees in both nutrition and science.IN AN article published by the Agence France Press, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) noted in its research that staff turnover in the country’s BPO industry “averaged about 30 percent annually, compared with less than 10 percent in other sectors,” according to senior ILO researcher Jon Messenger.The ILO urged governments as well as companies to promote and protect the health and safety of BPO staff specially those working in the night shift. Moreover, the United Nations-affiliated organization called on call center operators to redesign work processes so that the staff could enjoy more autonomy at work.The ILO study covered the BPO industry of India, the Philippines, Brazil and Argentina.Dr. Wilson also urged Filipinos to adopt clean and healthy eating, stressing that people can start eating healthy at any point in life. Nevertheless, she said eating healthy during childhood helps them to be on the right track. “However a person can choose to shift their diet any day. Fast food options definitely make it too easy to choose processed foods over healthy foods. A person needs to prioritize health and make intentional choices,” she explained.“Clean eating is eating in a way that supports health and doesn’t negatively affect health. That includes getting adequate macro and micronutrients in balanced meals at consistent intervals through the day. To eat clean, I suggest avoiding sugar [refined sugar], dairy [from cow milk], gluten, processed foods, preservatives and fillers, fried foods, and artificial sweeteners,” Wilson added.SHE underscored the importance of having adequate sleep from 7.5 to nine hours of sleep, preferably starting at 10 pm. In some cases where older adults are more likely to have sleep issues, Wilson recommends following sleep hygiene suggestions: clean eating, stress recovery and appropriate exercise. She added people should also address nutrient deficiencies, hormone imbalances, digestive issues including gut microbiome imbalances.Dr. Wilson said managing various types of stress causes disruptions, imbalances, deficiencies, and depletions is quite important for one’s health. “When we address all of the effects of stress in our body, mind and spirit, we experience recovery and resilience,” she said.Wilson said pursuing an active lifestyle should also be an important part of mitigating stress. In her book, “Master Your Stress Reset Your Health,” she reviewed different exercise options.“It’s important to choose one that is of interest to you, and that matches your body and your Stress Type. It could be anything from walking, to yoga, to pilates, HIT, strength training, and more,” she said.HEALTHY living advocate Healthy Options recently invited Wilson to Manila and Cebu to talk about her best-selling book, “Master Your Stress. Reset Your Health.”Through the science of epigenetics, Wilson showed to the audience the connectedness of cortisol, adrenaline, and neurotransmitters, and how people can balance these through her C.A.R.E. program: Clean eating, Adequate sleep, Recovery, and Exercise.“It’s not about being ‘stress-free’—that’s impossible. It’s about learning to give yourself and your body what it needs in order to be healthy in spite of the stress.”Rizal Raoul S.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/09/psoriasis-phl-advocates-for-inclusive-quality-and-accessible-health-care/,"Psoriasis PHL advocates for inclusive, quality, and accessible health care","Psoriasis Philippines (PsorPhil), an advocacy and support group for individuals with psoriatic diseases in the Philippines, recently marked World Psoriasis Day by advocating for inclusivity, quality, and access to healthcare. The organization stressed that everyone with psoriasis deserves access to the care and support they deserve.World Psoriasis Day has been celebrated on October 29th for more than a decade, and is now observed in over 70 countries including the Philippines. The theme of World Psoriasis Day 2023 is “Access for All.” The global leader in fighting psoriatic disease, IFPA or the International Federation of Psoriasis Associations, explained that the theme highlighted that people with psoriatic disease must have affordable access to the right treatment at the right time.“Health is a basic human right. And WHO’s call for health for all resounds with a powerful message that is deeply personal for all of us. Our community has long fought for recognition, understanding, and access to the best care possible. Now it’s our time to make sure these principles are just not words on paper but a reality in our lives,” said Josef De Guzman, founder of PsorPhil.“Psoriasis is more than skin deep; it can affect every aspect of our lives. The burden is not just physical but also emotional, psychological, and financial. The pain, the itch, and the judgment we endure are not to be taken lightly. We deserve access to treatments, healthcare, and support that will allow us to live our lives to the fullest,” added De Guzman.For PsorPhil, this year’s World Psoriasis Day theme, “Access for All,” is a beacon of hope, guiding them towards a future where psoriatics are included in the universal health coverage. PsorPhil represents the interests of 1 to 2 million Filipinos believed to be suffering in silence with psoriasis.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), psoriasis, categorized as a noncommunicable disease (NCD), is a chronic, painful, disfiguring and disabling disease. It is a lifelong skin condition that negatively impacts on patients’ quality of life.Psoriasis is associated with a number of comorbidities. Psoriasis skin lesions cause itching, stinging, and pain. Some people with psoriasis may develop chronic, inflammatory arthritis (psoriatic arthritis), which can lead to joint deformities and impairment.In a related development, PsorPhil has launched the Generalized Pustular Psoriasis (GPP) Network. This groundbreaking initiative focuses on individuals battling GPP, an exceedingly rare and severe form of psoriasis that can be life-threatening. The project provides a holistic approach to caring for GPP patients through patient-powered support, research, and education.GPP is a rare and severe autoimmune inflammatory disorder, causing widespread, painful, and pus-filled blisters (pustules) on the skin, often surrounded by inflamed, red skin.Given the potential for life-threatening complications and its significant impact on overall well-being, early detection and timely intervention are of paramount importance.Dr. Bryan Ko Guevara, a speaker at the GPP Network launch, highlighted the importance of consulting a board-certified dermatologist for GPP or psoriasis, as misdiagnosis can happen. He emphasized the significance of early treatment and advised against self-medication. Dr. Guevara is board-certified in both dermatology and dermatopathology. He is a fellow of the Philippine Dermatological Society (PDS) and the Dermatopathology Society of the Philippines.The other speakers were Dr. Antonio C. Sison, the first and only board certified Psychiatrist and Dermatologist in the Philippines, who talked about “The Skin tells a story: Patients and families sharing their journey with GPP,” and Dr. Ronaldo Q. De Vera from the Philippine Rheumatology Association who discussed psoriatic arthritis.The launch event, held on October 25 in Quezon City, brought together GPP patients from across the Philippines who bravely shared their personal struggles, creating a deeply moving and unforgettable moment. The event was a hybrid gathering, with many patients joining via Zoom to facilitate their participation."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/11/09/improve-phl-health-system-with-bigger-budget-more-investments-study/,"Improve PHL health system with bigger budget, more investments–study","The prevalence of medical and dental missions, which regularly attract a big number of people in Metro Manila and the provinces, is an indication that there is a lot to be done in improving the health system of the country.“It is an indictment of our government. It means that our health system is horrible. But in fairness to the government, the Philippine Health Corp. (PhilHealth) and the Universal Health Care Act are movements in the right direction,” said Dr. Samuel Ang, Director General of the Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center in a one-on-one interview at the sidelines of the free medical and dental mission undertaken with volunteer doctors, dentists, nurses and staff of Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Inc (FFCCCII) and Chinese General Hospital.DESPITE the increase in health investing, the Philippine health system, sad to say, is still in the doldrums manifested by the slow progress and poor health outcomes.According to a study released by state think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies [PIDS] titled “Public Health and Labor Policy,” researchers Charlotte Justine Diokno-Sicat, Valerie Gilbert Ulep, Robert Hector Palomar, Ricxie Maddawin, and Mark Gerald Ruiz cited “chronic underinvestment as the primary cause of the health sector’s lackluster growth.”Further, the study pointed out that the Philippines spent only half of the amount of what middle-income countries and its Association of Southeast Asian Nations counterparts on public spending on health, which accounted for about 1.5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Philippine public health spending was principally lower than that of Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, and Malaysia, which spent four times more.“Philippine GDP has rapidly increased in recent years, but the country experienced only modest improvements in health outcomes compared with its neighboring countries,” the authors said.THE authors recommended boosting investments in the health sector. They added this will not only drive the Philippines’ economic activity and growth but also increase workers’ productivity.“Government spending in the health sector is worth increasing with respect to further improving productivity, especially for the employed,” the authors said.“A 1 percent increase in public health spending per capita may be related to an increase of about 15.1 percent to 17.9 percent in labor productivity in five years,” they added.The authors pointed out that it this is consistent with the theory in health economics that higher investments or spending in health may be related to better productivity.The authors urged the government to build better health policies that would benefit the country’s labor force and eventually help the economy to accelerate.The authors stressed the importance of continued investments in human capital and education and other key areas to stimulate economic growth while improving the population’s well-being.APART from underspending in health, the study noted challenges in implementing the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act, where the government aspires to increase public spending to facilitate equitable healthcare access for all Filipinos. The authors said the implementation of the UHC Act should not only be confined to a health sector agenda alone but also part and parcel of the country’s policy to improve economic productivity.“While the UHC Act provides the legal framework, critical components of the law have yet to be implemented, including mobilization of health resources and reforms,” they added.The authors emphasized that the type of spending is as critical as the level of public expenditure. Thus, they suggested investing in cost-effective health interventions and improving the country’s primary and preventive care, which is more efficient and effective in enhancing health outcomes than curative or hospital-based care.In addition, the authors said physical health infrastructures must be financed and supported to encourage businesses and provide workers with needed equipment, tools, and technology to be more productive.Image credits: Rizal Raoul S.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/10/19/mph-to-boost-expansion-plans-empowerment-of-nurses/,"MPH to boost expansion plans, empowerment of nurses","In addition to acquiring more hospitals in strategic locations in the country, Metro Pacific Health (MPH), the country’s largest private hospital group, is planning to venture into ambulatory care and home care.During a recent roundtable discussion with media, Dr. Harish Pillai, Group Chief Executive Officer of Metro Pacific Health, noted that more Filipinos are visiting outpatient clinics for their health needs. He added that the pandemic had also created a demand for homecare.“We have transformed ourselves into MPH and this is a signal to the community that we are going beyond hospitals. We are moving our focus from hospitals to healthcare overall and in a big way,” he said.Dr. Pillai related that MPH had gone “through a two-year remarkable journey” and that it has always been the dream of Manny Pangilinan, Metro Pacific Investment Corp., chairman, to “invest and build capacity and capability for his homeland, for his beloved Filipinos.”“MPH is a manifestation of Manny Pangilinan’s enduring dream of building capacity and capability for all Filipinos. In the health-care sector, he constantly reminds us that health care gives a sense of equity. As such, we always chase the three As in health care: affordability for all Filipinos; accessibility and assurance which is basically the minimum measure of the quality of care,” Dr. Pillai said.He added that Pangilinan noted a trend of Filipinos traveling abroad for high end procedures in neighboring countries like Singapore.“Through the health-care portfolio, he says that no Filipino will need to travel overseas for health care because the capacity and capability is in the country. So that’s something that constantly guides us like a North Star,” he said.Just recently, MPH acquired a majority stake in Antipolo Doctors Inc., the owner and operator of Antipolo Doctors Hospital (ADH). This brought to 22 the number of hospitals in MPH’s portfolio and is the group’s first foray into Rizal. Situated along Manuel L. Quezon Extension, Antipolo, Rizal, ADH is a Level 2-ready facility with 77 beds. Since its foundation in 1992 by an enterprising group of 11 doctor-founders, ADH has maintained a record of medical proficiency. While primarily serving the healthcare needs of Antipolo City, the hospital’ reach spans various region in Rizal Province such as Taytay, Teresa and Angono, driven by a pool of over 200 doctors.“As part of due diligence, we look at locations in the country where there is a huge demand where we feel we can have hospitals in these areas and help them grow. We are also looking into partnering with local doctors, local communities moving forward so each and every project, in fact the entire 22 hospitals, and the turnaround has been quite significant,” Dr. Pillai said.He reiterated that MPH is currently focusing on mergers and acquisitions and that the group would only consider constructing its own hospital if it was a “viable opportunity.”“MPH has a very good track record of merger and acquisition projects. The advantage of brownfield projects or an existing project is the existing brand reputation, the existing infrastructure, existing access to clinical resources. Therefore, the turnaround results are quicker and that is our core competency,” Dr. Pillai explained.MPH also introduced during the roundtable discussion its transformative initiative called “Project Nightingale.” Dr. Annabelle Borromeo, MPH Chief Nursing Officer, said Project Nightingale “is our response to a pressing challenge in the healthcare landscape: the nursing shortage.”“This is not only a Philippine issue but a global one, impacting countries worldwide. This year, we are introducing an initiative that not only aims to address the challenge but more importantly, celebrates nursing excellence,” she said.With the aim of empowering Filipino nursing students and current nurses, the project is a three-part event happening on October 20 which coincides with National Nurses’ Week. The first is the national championship of the MPH Battle of the Nightingales (BOTN). The BOTN is an inter-nursing school quiz-based competition which started in 2017 with one MPH hospital, West Metro Medical Center and subsequently became a yearly event until it was decided to do a Mindanao wide regional run in 2022.“This year, MPH brought BOTN to the national stage in the first ever nationwide run with a series of hospital level events that have been running since May of this year and the last of which happened in September 27,” Dr. Borromeo explained.Some 500 students spread across 200 schools participated in the hospital-level runs. Apart from cash prizes, each student in the hospital level round received a P100,000 scholarship to fund their nursing studies. On October 30, BOT will culminate in the national championship with 12 schools.The second event is the Soledad Velez Pangilinan Nursing Excellence Award (SVP NEA), and the goal is to recognize outstanding nurses in three categories: Excellence in Clinical Nursing Practice; Excellence in Nursing Leadership and Excellence in Nursing Education.The award is named after Pangilinan’s mother who was a staunch supporter of the Philippine health-care system, advocating patient and family-centered care.“From 47 nominees across 18 MPH hospitals, 15 exceptional finalists have been identified and a distinguished jury, renowned nursing, and health leaders, will determine the winners in each category. The winners will be announced on October 20 in a grand event celebrating their achievements and their commitment to embody the heart of Filipino health care,” she said.The third event is the Metro Pacific Health Healthcare Expo which will “showcase MPH hospitals as institutions of health care and as great places to grow and nurture nursing careers.” Dr. Borromeo added that the expo is MPH’s way of showing its support for future nurses who will take the Nursing Licensure Exam in November.“In conclusion, Project Nightingale is a celebration, a commitment, and an empowerment tool. It’s about ensuring that the heart of Filipino health care is stronger than ever, resonating in the lives of our nurses and the patients they serve,” Dr. Borromeo said."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/10/19/bong-go-advocates-for-amplified-mental-health-initiatives/,Bong Go advocates for amplified mental health initiatives,"Senator Christopher “Bong” Go stressed in an interview on Tuesday, October 17, the critical need for mental health interventions and sufficient budgetary allocations for related programs given the challenges faced by Filipinos in the aftermath of the pandemic.“According to the World Health Organization, 16% of Filipino children had mental disorders… about 404 learners from public schools committed suicide in 2021, and 2,147 learners attempted suicide,” Go said in response to questions regarding the significance of providing substantial mental health interventions to Filipinos.The senator expressed his concern over the reduction in the proposed mental health budget from P1.9 billion in the 2023 General Appropriations Act to only a proposed P683 million for the following year which he hopes the Senate will be able to increase once they start plenary deliberations on the 2024 budget. “Nabigla tayo, dapat po’y maging proactive tayo, dapat lagi tayong handa hindi lang po sa mental health issue, kabuuan po, health in general po. Ang kalusugan ng bawat Pilipino ay katumbas po ‘yan ng maayos at produktibong buhay para sa bawat Pilipino,” Go said.Go, the principal sponsor and one of the authors of Republic Act No. 11959 or the Regional Specialty Centers Act, also highlighted the approval of this legislation to bring specialty services including mental health to communities. Signed into law by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr. on August 24, this Act signifies a significant step towards upgrading the nation’s health system.“At isisingit ko na lang po, bilang chairman ng Committee on Health, proud po akong ibalita sa inyo na aprubado na po ang Regional Specialty Centers natin… kasama na po dito ‘yung mental health (specialty centers), madadagdagan pa po ito sa mga existing (Department of Health) DOH hospitals,” said Go.This Act mandates the establishment of regional specialty centers within existing DOH regional hospitals, covering various medical fields like mental health, cancer, and heart centers, thereby catering to the diversified healthcare needs of the citizenry.Go further stressed the critical importance of healthcare investments and said, “The more we should invest in health. Iyan po ang importante ngayon.”The senator has been pushing for the passage of his proposed Senate Bill No. (SBN) 1786, aimed at mandating public higher education institutions (HEIs) to establish Mental Health Offices on the campuses. He accentuated the urgency of addressing mental health issues among young learners.“Mayroon rin po tayong nai-file sa Senado… ‘yung maglalagay po ng concerned mental health offices sa mga eskwelahan para matutukan ang mga estudyante,” he said.He added, “Napakabigat po, sabi ko nga 404 ang nag-committed suicide ang naiulat noong 2021 at 2,147 na learners attempted suicide.”If enacted into law, SB 1786 proposes Mental Health Offices to set up campus hotlines with dedicated and trained guidance counselors to provide assistance to the whole HEI community, especially the students. The bill also states that special attention shall be given to those identified to have mental health problems or conditions, especially those at risk of committing suicide. Moroever, if approved, the Commission on Higher Education and the public HEIs, through their Mental Health Offices, shall then initiate and sustain a heightened campaign to raise the collective consciousness about mental health. Furthermore, the measure also proposes to mandate educational institutions to raise awareness on mental health issues, identify and provide support and services for individuals at risk, and facility access by developing necessary mechanisms to further empower educational institutions in promoting the mental health and wellness of students, faculty, teaching and non-teaching staff, and other personnel. The awareness campaign shall give special emphasis to the issues of suicide prevention, stress handling, mental health and nutrition, and guidance and counseling. The campaign shall ensure that the whole HEI community is aware of in-campus mental health services.In addition, Go has co-authored and co-sponsored SBN 2200, known as the proposed Basic Education Mental Health and Well-Being Promotion Act, principally sponsored by Senator Win Gatchalian. This measure aims to provide comprehensive mental health support for the youth in the country’s basic education system, requiring both private and public schools to integrate mental health education and support services into their curriculum.“Bilang chairman naman ng Committee on Health, tutulong po ako sa abot ng aking makakaya na isulong pa po na madagdagan ng pondo ang ating mental health (programs),” he affirmed.Image credits: The BusinessMirror provides readers with a broader look at today’s business in these challenging times.

In case a member needs a copy of their Member Data Record (MDR), it can be easily downloaded and printed from the said Portal through the following link: .PhilHealth reminded members to be cautious and ensure that they access only its official website () by taking note of the domain which is and not .com or .net. The website connection should start with an https (hypertext transfer protocol secure) tag and with a display padlock connection secure icon on the left side. To avail of the services at the Member Portal, first time users must first create an account using their PhilHealth Identification Number (PIN) and a strong password. A confirmation will be sent to their email address, and once confirmation is received by PhilHealth, they can start using the services of the Portal.Meanwhile, the state-insurer also reminded its partner health facilities that they can now access the Health Care Institution Portal. With this development, there is no longer a need for members to present their printed MDRs to be able to avail of the benefits. The Agency also assured that all Filipinos, registered or not, are entitled to avail themselves of the benefits as mandated by the Universal Health Care Act. While frontline systems are still being restored, unregistered members (those without PIN) should submit a duly accomplished PhilHeath Member Registration Form (PMRF) together with supporting documents to the health facility to avail of the benefits.PhilHealth Chief Emmanuel R. Ledesma, Jr. renewed his appeal to the public to remain calm and vigilant against phishing attacks that may arise from data leaked by the hackers. He also encouraged members to change passwords with new and strong ones, and not to divulge this to other people. cautioned Ledesma of members availing of offers proliferating in social media.He again echoed the advice of experts not to entertain and click doubtful links. “It is best to ignore suspicious calls, and to delete text or emails from unknown and suspicious senders to avoid being victimized by scammers,” he said."

This includes thinking differently about the underlying biology of lung cancer, from early stages – where we aim to help patients live longer and cancer-free – to late stages, where we look to meaningfully extend survival.said: “Our new data is a significant step forward in shaping the future of lung cancer and provide compelling evidence for the potential role of our diverse pipeline of therapies in improving outcomes for patients at various stages of the disease.”Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths in 2020.Environmental factors, including air pollution, aggravated by climate change, may also play a role in the development of lung cancer globally. The diverse disease epidemiology worldwide requires a differentiated treatment approach. In Asia, an increasing number of non-smokers are diagnosed with lung cancer, especially young women. Additionally, the prevalence of well-characterised genomic drivers is different compared to Western populations. Asian populations have higher rates of epidermal growth factor receptor () and lower rates of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene () mutations. said: “Differentiated approaches are needed to account for the diverse patient profile across our region. This includes targeting the appropriate population for screening, ensuring patients have access to innovative targeted therapies, and addressing environmental pollution that is increasing the burden of lung cancer.”AstraZeneca is committed to addressing some of the biggest healthcare challenges facing humankind and improving the lives of billions of people. Collaboration in the scientific community is critical to improving outcomes for patients. AstraZeneca collaborates with key stakeholders and decision-makers to ensure innovative solutions can reach patients, no matter where they live. By leveraging the latest technologies and insights, AstraZeneca is dedicated to providing new options for patients and clinicians that allow them the opportunity to achieve improved survival. Supporting our ambition to eliminate cancer as a cause of death, AstraZeneca is investing in early screening, which is essential to early detection and reducing lung cancer mortality. , a first-of-its-kind consensus paper for the Asian population was developed by the to provide recommendations on lung cancer screening in Asia. AstraZeneca is a founding member of the Lung Ambition Alliance, a global coalition working to accelerate innovation and deliver meaningful improvements for people with lung cancer, including and beyond treatment. The Lung Ambition Alliance has initiatives and partnerships with important stakeholders in the Philippines. “Together Against Cancer” is a program in collaboration with the Cancer Warriors Foundation to support the local implementation of the National Integrated Cancer Control Act. The “Screen To Beat Lung Cancer” initiative marries tuberculosis screening with lung cancer screening using artificial intelligence-based chest x-ray to help detect early signs of lung cancer. Recognising the interconnection between climate and health, AstraZeneca is working with governments and policymakers worldwide to advance sustainable healthcare solutions that protect patient outcomes while reducing the environmental footprint of care.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/10/16/bong-go-lauds-dohs-five-year-mental-health-framework/,Bong Go lauds DOH’s five-year mental health framework,"As Chair of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, Senator Christopher “Bong” Go expressed his support for the Department of Health (DOH)’s newly launched 2024-2028 Philippine Council for Mental Health (PCMH) Strategic Framework, a comprehensive plan aimed at addressing mental health issues in the Philippines.“Mental health is an integral component of holistic health. We need to treat it with the same level of attention, importance and care as physical health,” Go said.“We cannot overlook mental health, especially during these challenging times. Many Filipinos are grappling with mental health issues, and it is crucial that we allocate sufficient funds for these programs,” he added.The PCMH Strategic Framework is designed to shape policies for mental health. Endorsed by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Special Initiative for Mental Health, the framework prioritizes enhanced guidance and referral systems for patients, to establish an internal oversight board for mental health matters, and to educate media organizations on responsible reporting in the context of mental health.“I am confident that we can address more mental health concerns in the country. With the contributions of all partner agencies under the PCMH and the guidance of WHO, we can achieve all the strategies we are set to do,” DOH Secretary Teodoro Herbosa earlier said.Go has been a long-time advocate of mental health initiatives. During a Committee on Finance hearing earlier this month, he emphasized the need for proper funding and implementation of mental health programs.“Hindi rin natin dapat kalimutan ang sapat na pondo para sa mental health programs lalo na sa panahon ng krisis tulad ng pandemya na marami sa ating mga kababayan ang apektado po ang mental health,” said Go.He also highlighted that the proposed budget for DOH has been reduced by over ten billion pesos compared to the current year.“We need to restore and allocate funds for various programs, including those focused on mental health. I endorse additional funding for the Department of Health and urge collective action to invest more in healthcare,” added Go.Go’s focus on mental health is consistent with his ongoing legislative efforts. He has co-authored and co-sponsored Senate Bill No. (SBN) 2200, known as the proposed Basic Education Mental Health and Well-Being Promotion Act. This measure principally sponsored by Sen. Win Gatchalian aims to provide comprehensive mental health support for the youth in the country’s basic education system, mandating both private and public schools to integrate mental health education and support services into their curriculum.Furthermore, Go has also been pushing for the passage of his proposed SBN 1786, which seeks to mandate public higher education institutions to establish Mental Health Offices in their campuses.The senator emphasized the urgency of addressing mental health issues among young learners, saying, “It is our moral and civic duty to respond with urgency and compassion. We must refuse to let another young life be lost due to untreated mental health issues.”Moreover, Go also stressed the importance of strengthening the implementation of Republic Act No. 11036 or the Philippine Mental Health Act. Former president Rodrigo Duterte signed the said Act during his term, to underscore the right of all Filipinos to mental health care and aims to provide mental health services at the barangay level, integrate mental health and wellness programs at the grassroots level, improve mental health facilities, and promote mental health education in schools and workplaces.“As Chairman of the Committee on Health, I believe that physical, emotional, and mental health are all equally important, and I will continue to support measures that would protect and promote the different aspects of health as a whole,” Go underscored.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/10/16/govt-academe-medical-and-research-community-biopharma-industry-eye-phl-as-center-of-clinical-trials-in-asean/,"Gov’t, academe, medical and research community, biopharma industry eye PHL as center of clinical trials in ASEAN ","Multi-stakeholder groups from the government, academe, medical and research community, private sector, and patient organizations gathered in a forum to jumpstart discussions aimed at transforming the Philippines as a major hub for clinical trials in the ASEAN region. The University of the Philippines – National Institutes for Health (UP-NIH), the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines (PHAP), Department of Science and Technology – Philippine Council for Health Research (DOST-PCHRD), Department of Trade – Board of Investments (DTI-BOI), and the Philippine Clinical Research Professionals (PCRP) spearheaded an experts panel forum with theme “Philippines as Center of Excellence in Clinical Trials: Let’s Make it Happen” at the UP BGC Auditorium. “Achieving the goal of making the Philippines the center of excellence in clinical trials in the region will entail bringing together all relevant stakeholders, starting with a shared understanding of its health and economic value and clarifying each stakeholder’s roles in achieving this. We are pleased to be holding this forum to demonstrate our commitment to making this transformation happen,” said UP-NIH Executive Director Dr. Eva Maria Cutiongco-Dela Paz. The effort to propel the Philippines as a center of excellence in clinical trials is aligned with one of the goals of the Department of Health – Philippine Medicines Policy (PMP) which seeks to “build and design the clinical trial system to elevate the country as a Regional Center of Excellence”.“Clinical trials are a significant part of pharmaceutical research and development that offers options for patients to receive innovative treatments, opportunities for healthcare professionals to increase knowledge and experience in cutting-edge research happening globally, and for the Philippine society to take part in advancing science and health through research. We fully support this vision to make the Philippines a center for clinical trials to advance science and healthcare in the country and the region,” said UP-NIH National Clinical Trials and Translation Center Director Dr. Benjamin P. Sablan, Jr. The research and development of medicines and vaccines is a long, risky, and complex process that requires significant investments and expertise. On average, researchers are able to identify one promising drug from among 5,000–10,000 screened compounds. Researchers then extensively test the compound to ensure its efficacy and safety, a process that can take 10 to 15 years. The majority of this R&D process – in terms of investments, duration, and expertise needed – happens during the clinical trial process.“Clinical trials offer a faster pathway for the Philippines to lead and be the center of excellence in the region. We can lead the ASEAN region in the advancement of medicine and biopharmaceutical research and development, which as we have seen is crucial in confronting public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. We are honored to collaborate with our partners from the government, academe and patient organizations for us to achieve this vision for people’s health and support our country’s scientific and economic progress,” said PHAP President Dr. Diana Edralin, whose organization represents the biopharmaceutical industry in the Philippines.In her message, British Ambassador to the Philippines Ms. Laure Beaufils expressed support for the country’s aspiration to be a center of excellence in clinical trials to improve healthcare, boost research and create jobs. “I reiterate the UK’s unwavering commitment to the Philippines to remain a reliable partner for Health and Science, especially as we build back better after the COVID pandemic. Our most notable achievement in this sector over the last four years has been building agile partnerships across the Philippines’ dynamic Health and Science landscape, anchored on a shared commitment to leave no one behind – walang iwanan. And we hope the years ahead allow us to build on even stronger foundations of our partnerships as a Force for Good,” she said. The Philippines has been conducting clinical trials for many years. In 2022, 82 clinical trials were started, and 57 have already begun as of mid-year 2023. Approximately 80% of these trials are industry-sponsored global clinical trials for new drug application and marketing authorization worldwide, and the Philippines participate in about 5% of all these global clinical trials. South East Asian countries neighboring the Philippines, like Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, have retained a stable number of clinical trials, while Vietnam continues to grow year on year at +5.32% CAGR.“A robust innovation ecosystem is important to discover and develop breakthroughs for cancer, tuberculosis, mental health, and diabetes among several health challenges. PHAP is committed to partnering with the government and the healthcare community in building this environment in the country by forwarding recommendations to position the Philippines as a center of excellence in clinical trials in the whole of ASEAN,” said PHAP Executive Director Mr. Teodoro Padilla. Among the panel of experts who were part of the forum were Healthserv Los Banos Medical Center Adult Medicine Specialist Dr. Mercedes Dela Viña for the “Overview of the Conduct of Clinical Trials in the Philippines”; PCHRD Executive Director Dr. Jaime Montoya for the topic “Clinical Research as Platform for Innovation and Access: What it Takes to be a Center of Excellence”; DOH Pharmaceutical Division Chief Dr. Fides Maria Aileen Buenafe for “Innovation and Access”; IQVIA Clinical Operations and Partner Site Manager Ms Zohra Jane Esperal for “The Economic Footprint of Clinical Researches”; AstraZeneca Vice President, International Medical, Dr. Pei Chieh Fong for the “Value of the Clinical Trial Data and Research Outcomes to Innovations in Treatment and Diagnostics”; and PCRP Past President and Honorary Member Ms Anna Ordinario for the “State of Clinical Trials in the Philippines”.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/10/12/doh-pushes-for-additional-%e2%82%a7400m-budget-for-hpv-vaccination-drive/,DOH pushes for additional ₧400M budget for HPV vaccination drive,"Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire recently appealed for an additional P400 million funding to strengthen the Department of Health’s anti-cervical cancer immunization program and expand the vaccination coverage among 4th grade public school girls across the Philippines.Vergeire explained that the current DOH budget for the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination only covers 15 regions, which unfortunately excludes Region 2 and MIMAROPA.“Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in Filipino women. To address this issue, we have implemented an HPV vaccination program for 4th graders, targeting students aged nine to 14 years old. Currently, this program is implemented in 15 regions, excluding Region II and Region IVB. We are seeking additional funding of more than $400 million to expand this initiative nationwide and provide the HPV vaccine to all 4th graders nationwide,” Vergeire said in a press statement. Cervical cancer ranks as the 2nd most frequent cancer among women in the Philippines and the 2nd most frequent cancer among women between 15 and 44 years of age. HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer.During a recent Senate hearing, Sen. Joseph Victor Ejercito asked the DOH for updates on the agency’s anti-cervical cancer immunization program. As a health champion in the Senate notable for pushing landmark health laws like the Universal Health Care Act and the National Integrated Cancer Control Act (NICCA), Ejercito underscored the need for cancer prevention measures to be given priority.In 2023, the DOH acquired one million doses of anti-cervical cancer vaccines, targeting 500,000 girls aged nine to 14. This accounts for nearly 38 percent of the school-age population nationwide. DOH’s appeal for additional budget from the Senate and Congress aims to secure sufficient funding to reach the agency’s targets for its vaccination program.However, the 2024 National Expenditure Program has allocated only 750,000 doses of HPV vaccines, falling short of the annual target of vaccinating one million of its target cohort. This budget cut could endanger the health of thousands of young girls who rely on government-supported HPV vaccination programs to protect against cervical cancer.DOH has been partnering with the Department of Education (DepEd) and local government units to improve the rollout of its HPV vaccination program.Meanwhile, Sen. Pia Cayetano, senior vice chair of the Senate Finance Committee, encouraged the DOH to continue strengthening its collaboration with DepEd to improve vaccination uptake in the country and strengthen cancer prevention campaigns in school settings.“Simple informational materials will be especially helpful for those who need a second dose of the vaccine,” said Cayetano. “If you [DOH] work with DepEd, they will be the ones to help educate the parents of these students.”The DepEd directs all schools that are implementing face-to-face classes to resume the delivery of school-based health services to learners, which includes immunization.Prior to administering the vaccine, parents’ consent must first be obtained by school officials. That is why vaccination education campaigns usually highlight the role of parents in fortifying the health shield of their children through timely vaccination against disease.Rizal Raoul S. Reyes has covered technology, science, business, property and special reports. He had working stints with the Business Star, Manila Bulletin and Independent Daily News."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/10/12/climate-change-crisis-to-have-a-great-impact-on-peoples-health-expert/,Climate change crisis to have a great impact on people’s health–expert,"Climate change, no matter how the cliché goes, affects not only the environment but the planet. It also affects the health of humans because climate change affects vital elements that humans need in order to survive in this world such as clean air, safe, potable drinking water, enough food and secure shelter.The World Health Organization (WHO) said that between the years 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to “cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress,” while direct damage costs to health “is estimated to be between US$2 to 4 billion per year by 2030. The global health agency reported that developing countries, those with weak health infrastructures, “will be the least able to cope without assistance to prepare and respond.”The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has revealed that in order to avert and prevent millions of climate change-related deaths, the global temperature should not exceed 1.5°C. Anything higher than this, even by an additional tenth of a degree of warming, would be damaging to people’s lives and health, according to the group.Case in point was the recent heavy rainfall and the ensuing floods that happened in Libya, which was hit by Storm “Daniel.” For a country where approximately 93 percent of the land surface receives less than 100 mm (around 4 inches) of rain per year, what happened in Derna should be a “wake up call for the world” on the increasing risk of catastrophic floods in a world changed by climate change, says Jagan Chapagain, Secretary General of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). Scientists declared that even in a 1.2°C climate, which is already “warm,” the rainfall Libya experienced was termed “extreme,” an event that may occur once every 300 to 600 years.ACCORDING to Dr. Maria Guevara, the International Medical Secretary for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the climate crisis is a health crisis that has disastrous health impacts, especially in Asia Pacific.Over the past several years, Dr. Guevara noted that the country has experienced the onslaught of very strong typhoons like Typhoon Yolanda (international name: Haiyan) which struck the country back in 2013. This super typhoon totally devastated the central part of the Philippines through extensive flooding that placed homes underwater, destroyed countless properties and killed human lives.However, she said it’s not just about cyclones and super typhoons. She revealed that July of this year was the Earth’s hottest temperature in 174 years. This resulted in many conflagrations such as those in Canada, then major countries in Europe such as France, Spain, Germany, Poland, and Italy experienced major heatwaves that they’ve never experienced before, same as in coastlines from Florida to Australia.Being a medical humanitarian organization, Doctors Without Borders, according to Dr. Guevara, is already seeing the impact of climate change on the people they treat in over 70 countries around the world, like in Myanmar and Bangladesh, which Cyclone Mocha hit and destroyed not only communities but refugee camps as well.Over the years, she said, these extreme weather events are happening globally, with greater frequency, and stronger impact. However, Dr. Guevara said climate change also has other impacts on health. She said high levels of vector-borne, food-borne, and water-borne diseases in areas where they operate is worrying, as this is projected to increase as the climate crisis accelerates.Dr. Guevara pointed out that based on their estimates, there will be 15 million more cases of malaria yearly, with 30,000 deaths linked to that, aside from what is seen now. “One billion more people are expected to be exposed to dengue, not only in Asia Pacific, where it is much more prevalent, but across the world. European Union officials recently warned that there is a growing risk of mosquito-borne viral diseases such as dengue and chikungunya in Europe due to climate change. We have seen cholera outbreaks in at least 30 countries. While this is due to multiple factors, climate change is most definitely one of them,” Dr. Guevara explained.According to Dr. Guevara, climate change is also linked to food insecurity and malnutrition. “With extreme weather events such as heat waves and increased rainfall come droughts and floods that impact farming and fishing communities, affecting everything from the yield of crops grown, to the animals that till the soil, to the number of fish caught in nets,” she said.It does not end there, according to her, as other impacts of climate change include the spread of non-communicable diseases, forced displacement and migration, and the emergence of conflicts, among others. “And all of these are expected to intensify over time—unless we take urgent action,” she added. She said Doctors Without Borders can only do so much but much more is needed, especially in Asia Pacific to the Middle East, and the African nations. Countries with limited resources, Dr. Guevara averred, are enduring the worst of the devastation brought by the climate crisis, like Rohingya patients in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, who are already burdened and threatened by floodings and cyclones, while their patients in the island nation of Kiribati face climate and environmental changes that threaten their livelihoods and exacerbate their risks in contracting diseases.“We have been sounding the alarm. We see these huge needs brought about by the climate crisis, and we fear that these needs are outstripping our capacity to respond. We need the countries most responsible for this global warming of 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels to help those who are most affected, to take responsibility, and to provide financial and technical support to those most vulnerable. Governments of the most affected countries, including in Asia Pacific, must not only compel the top polluters to help them mitigate and manage the impacts of climate change, but also put in place policies and affirmative climate actions in addressing and reversing the impact of these issues,” Dr. Guevara declared.She noted, though, that they are already seeing commitments from world leaders, like the G20 nations who have committed to a greener and more climate-resilient health system. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which has five of the world’s 20 most at-risk countries located in the region, has announced an ambitious strategy to work towards carbon neutrality. The COP28 agenda in November has an increased focus on health, relief and disaster response, Dr. Guevara declared.“This is an important and critically urgent moment. These commitments are ambitious, but member-states of these regional blocs must see them through and take real action. Today, we are dangerously off track and urgent action needs to be taken now. The climate crisis requires a whole-of-society approach. People and organizations must also understand that our own behaviors are a part of the problem. We need to respond together, in solidarity with all, for the health of all.”"

To help protect members from being victimized by opportunists, PhilHealth strongly recommended changing passwords of online accounts, enabling multi-factor authentication, monitoring of suspicious activities in their online accounts, not opening and clicking suspicious emails and links, and not answering suspicious calls and text messages.“Using the stolen data, the hackers will likely target members through calls, emails or text messages. Let us then heed the advice of authorities to refrain from clicking doubtful links or providing passwords or OTPs. It is best to ignore suspicious calls, and to delete text or emails instead from unknown and suspicious senders,” PhilHealth Chief Emmanuel R. Ledesma, Jr. said.The state health insurer also appealed to refrain from further circulating leaked data as it has dire consequences under the law. Recently, authorities have said the hackers may face up to 20 years of imprisonment, while any individual or organization found to download, process or share such exfiltrated data will likewise be held accountable for unauthorized processing of personal information and may face criminal charges.PhilHealth reiterated that it welcomes and is ready to face any inquiry that will be called upon to get to the bottom of the incident. It vowed to cooperate fully with investigating agencies such as the National Privacy Commission, National Bureau of Investigation and Philippine National Police.“Bilang responsable sa mga impormasyon ng ating mga miyembro, nakahanda po kaming makipagtulungan sa mga imbestigasyon para lalong mapagbuti ang cybersecurity system. Makakaasa po ang publiko na may malaking kabutihang dulot ang pangyayaring ito para maging mas mabuti ang ating serbisyo sa miyembro,” Ledesma asserted. As of October 06, 2023, 100 percent of its public-facing applications were back online which include the website, Member Portal, eClaims for electronic submission of hospital claims, and EPRS for employer remittances. Application servers that cater to frontline services are also being readied to go back to normal operations."

You are the bridge that connects our communities with our healthcare institutions, ensuring that even the most remote and underserved areas receive the care and attention they deserve,” said Go.Go acknowledged the BHWs as the real heroes of the community, saying, “Kaya naman nais kong magpasalamat sa lahat ng mga Barangay Health Workers na narito ngayon. Kayo ang mga tunay na bayani ng ating komunidad. Araw-araw, inyong inilalaan ang inyong oras, lakas, upang siguruhing ang mga mamamayan ay ligtas at malusog.”In line with his advocacy for healthcare development, Go assured the BHWs of his ongoing efforts to improve their working conditions and expand their roles.“I have always been a staunch supporter of the healthcare sector and firmly believe that the Barangay Health Workers play a vital role in achieving our healthcare goals,” he said.The senator also discussed two key pieces of legislation he is pushing for aimed at supporting BHWs: Senate Bill No. (SBN) 197, also known as the Magna Carta for Barangays, and SBN 427, known as the Barangay Health Workers Compensation Act.The Magna Carta for Barangays proposes that barangay officials, including the Punong Barangay, members of the Sangguniang Barangay, the Sangguniang Kabataan chairperson, the barangay secretary, and barangay treasurer, receive similar treatment as regular government employees. This means they would be eligible for salaries, benefits, and allowances, among other perks.Meanwhile, SBN 427 proposes to provide BHWs a monthly honorarium of P3,000, along with a comprehensive package of benefits, including allowances, job security, regular training, and skill development opportunities.The bill also extends benefits from key institutions such as the Government Service Insurance System, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), and Pag-IBIG Fund.“Hindi po natin mararating itong narating natin ngayon, itong COVID response natin kung hindi sa sakripisyo ng ating mga BHW. Sila po ang unang dipensa natin lalo na po sa dito sa barangay level,” Go said in an interview.“Sila ang gumagamot agad, sila po ang frontline ng ating hangarin na mapanatiling malusog at walang sakit ang ating mga kababayan,” he added.He also mentioned his filing of SBN 2399, aimed at declaring April 7 as Barangay Health and Nutrition Workers Day.“I also filed Senate Bill 2399 to give due recognition to the contribution of all barangay health and nutrition workers in the delivery of our primary healthcare services in the country,” he added.Meanwhile, the senator, who is also chairperson of the Committee on Health, outlined his three main priorities: the ongoing operations of Malasakit Centers which was enacted into law through his efforts last Congress, the establishment of more Super Health Centers in strategic locations nationwide, and the proper implementation of the newly enacted Regional Specialty Centers Act which he championed in the Senate.He urged the public, particularly Cebuanos, to avail of medical and financial assistance from any of the Malasakit Centers located at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center, Cebu City Medical Center, and St. Anthony Mother & Child Hospital, all in Cebu City. Other Malasakit Centers in the province are available at Cebu Provincial Hospital in Carcar City, Lapu-Lapu City District Hospital, Eversley Childs Sanitarium and General Hospital in Mandaue City, and Talisay District Hospital in Talisay City.Malasakit Centers bring together representatives from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Department of Health (DOH), PhilHealth, and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office. These one-stop shops aim to support impoverished patients in reducing their hospital costs to the least possible amount.Go is the principal author and sponsor of Republic Act No. 11463 or the Malasakit Centers Act of 2019, which institutionalized the Malasakit Centers program. As of now, 159 Malasakit Centers are operational across the country, which have assisted over seven million Filipinos, according to DOH.His second priority, Super Health Centers, are medium-sized polyclinics offering a range of services including childbirth, dental care, and laboratory tests. Go revealed plans to construct more than 600 Super Health Centers nationwide within two years, including 19 in Cebu.Super Health Centers are designed to focus on primary care, consultation, and early detection, further strengthening the healthcare sector in the country especially in grassroots communities.Services offered in Super Health Centers include database management, out-patient, birthing, isolation, diagnostic (laboratory: x-ray and ultrasound), pharmacy and ambulatory surgical unit. Other available services are eye, ear, nose, and throat (EENT) service, oncology centers, physical therapy and rehabilitation center and telemedicine.Finally, Go also principally sponsored and is one of the authors of RA 11959, also known as the Regional Specialty Centers Act, which was signed into law by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr. on August 24.The law mandates the establishment of regional specialty centers within existing DOH regional hospitals. These centers will specialize in specific medical fields, such as cardiology, allowing patients to receive specialized care without having to travel to the National Capital Region to avail these services.In closing, the senator expressed his commitment to continue supporting and fighting for the rights of barangay health workers. “Hindi tayo magsasawa na suportahan at ipaglaban ang karapatan ng ating mga barangay health workers,” he assured.“As we move forward, let us continue to work together, hand in hand, to improve the health and well-being of our fellow Cebuanos and Filipinos nationwide,” concluded Go.During the event, Go and his team also distributed food packs to the BHWs.Following this, Go extended further support by distributing aid to thousands of Cebuanos facing hardships in the city. He also participated in the ribbon-cutting ceremony to inaugurate the new wing of Lapu-Lapu City Hospital. Additionally, he attended the National Teacher’s Day celebration, honoring educators in the same city.On that very day, Go was also guest of honor and speaker during the 33rd Commencement Exercises of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines Maragondon Branch in Cavite.Image credits:"

Unfortunately, the nearby RHU 4 is undergoing renovations. The Binangonan RHU was recently named one of the top-performing TB-DOTS Centers in the country. This could be mainly attributed to its successful case detection efforts to avert the spread of TV in the municipality, according to RHU Municipal Health Center Officer Dr. Angelito Dela Cuesta.During the event, TB survivors who graced the unveiling of the center’s new look also signified their commitment to promote awareness on TV prevention and treatment in their respective communities.“We need to improve how we are going to educate and give them incentives, inspire the people who are sick, and show them that there are people who are working tirelessly to bring their lives back to normal,” said Binangonan First Lady Dr. Rose Martha Callanta-Ynares, underscoring the pivotal role of innovations for disease prevention and treatment.This nationwide project is set to benefit three more TB-DOTS Centers in Luzon, three in Cebu, and one in Dumaguete City.ASIA’S premier coating manufacturer, Nippon Paint, is among the businesses that support this health initiative for many years. “We want to be a part of this mission of raising awareness by transforming spaces and fostering creativity,” Nippon Paint Philippines Technical Director Leticia Noma said, while citing the importance of visual arts to further push health-seeking behavior especially in hard-to-reach areas.The inaugural repainting used Nippon Weatherbond for the center’s exterior. This paint product can provide over 10 years of protection against fading and harsh weather conditions. On the other hand, the interior walls were coated with Nippon Vinitex Fresh and Nippon Spotless, both of which have antimicrobial properties—helpful for recuperating TB patients.Such collaboration with Nippon Paint is one of the many initiatives of USAID-TBIHSS project to raise awareness about TB and implement health processes and systems that will help the Philippines achieve its goal of eliminating TB by 2035.Per DOH estimates, 70 Filipinos die daily from TB. In 2021, over 1.6 million Filipinos succumbed to this ailment. The agency, however, stressed that the disease is curable and that afflicted patients can seek treatment from any TB DOTS Center nationwide.Roderick L.

Understanding the profound impact that memory-related issues can have on both patients and their families, all of the Memory Care Centers in the MPH group aim to provide comprehensive care by combining cutting-edge diagnostic methods and neurological testing; innovative treatments tailored for each individual, crafted by multi-disciplinary medical teams; and supportive care management that offers resources and programs to help patients and their families navigate the challenges of memory-related disorders.By championing these holistic approaches, MPH Memory Care Centers stand as beacons of hope for patients struggling with a myriad of concerns, from mild memory lapses to more severe cognitive disorders.Dr. Michelle Anlacan, a leading adult neurologist and dementia specialist at Cardinal Santos Medical Center, explains the need to create more awareness around memory-related illnesses and their management: “I think the most common misconception for treatment [of memory-related illnesses] is that there is no treatment. At Metro Pacific Health Memory Care Centers, we have several treatments available—with both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions—that will make life easier for both the patient and the family who is caring for them.”Dr. Anlacan also offers hope to those who find themselves living with memory-related disorders. “Being diagnosed with a memory-related illness such as Alzheimer’s is not the end of the world, especially if you are diagnosed early. There are many ways to continue living a fruitful life or ensure a full quality of life for your loved ones. Preparation, education, and the support of a good medical team are key.”Cardinal Santos Medical Center’s (CSMC) Memory Center is focused on creating awareness, promoting quality of life in the elderly, and delaying the progress of Alzheimer’s disease through its modern-day expertise in the brain and memory. The Center aims to provide early detection and management of dementia and treat patients with cognitive impairment from brain injury and diseases. Procedures of CSMC currently include Comprehensive Neurocognitive Workup, Medication Management, and Cognitive Rehabilitation Programs.The Memory Plus Center of Makati Medical Center (MMC) is a sub-specialty clinic that provides a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, management, and treatment process for people with complaints related to memory, cognitive impairment, and other behavioral or psychological concerns associated with neurodegenerative brain disorders.Believing that early risk assessment, prompt diagnosis, and initiation of management can help prevent worsening of cognitive decline, the team consists of Neurologists, Psychiatrists, and Neuropsychologists who specialize in Dementia and other cognitive impairments, conducting extensive neuropsychological evaluations, and developing treatment plans.The Memory Center of De Los Santos Medical Center also houses a team of specialists who provide compassionate and comprehensive consultations, evaluations, and treatment recommendations to monitor and enrich behavioral and mental wellness. The hospital objectively and methodically performs memory screening and memory assessment—open to all those who are concerned about their current mental well-being. It also offers structured counseling to both loved ones and caregivers to enhance their awareness about the proper care and supervision needed by those who are presently living with a form of dementia.These growing services of Memory Care Centers in Metro Pacific Health hospitals reaffirm the group’s commitment to continued medical excellence, investment in specialized facilities, and providing holistic, compassionate care for the communities it serves."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/10/05/raising-a-happy-child-can-result-in-having-a-good-child/,Raising a happy child can result in having a good child,"What makes a happy child? Is it about buying all they ask for and giving in to their every whim? Is it giving them longer gadget time? Is it about letting them go away when they are at their naughtiest?SADLY, some parents of today’s kids don’t have time to interact with their children since they’re busy working the entire week. Even on weekends, they forget to bond with their children and bring more happiness and joy in the minds of children. Some resort to giving their kids gadgets like mobile phones or tablets to divert their attention, to make them happy, so that parents can be left at peace.For Iya Villania-Arellano, TV news anchor and wife to TV program host Drew Arellano, she said they allow their kids to have their gadget time, but there are ground rules, like they should finish their tasks first and accomplish what they call the “gratitude journal” before they can use their gadgets. “I monitor also their behavior. If I see that there are behavioral changes after gadget time, especially when playing addictive games, then I step in with a limit on gadget usage.”Neri Naig-Miranda, actress and wife of Parokya ni Edgar frontman Chito Miranda, echoed Iya’s sentiments. “Before I used to let them use gadgets, but then I noticed that after gadget time, there was a change in behavior like they quickly become impatient or bored so I took the gadgets aways. I only allow our kids to use them if they’ve accomplished their homework, but still, gadget use is limited for an hour. Then I tell them to do something else like to write or draw or read a book. After I did that, I noticed the change. They now play actively, mostly outdoors, and they bond with each other very well,” she explained during the launch of “Babyflo Buddies,” where the two celebrities were also introduced as the brand’s newest ambassadors.Neri and Iya all lamented the fact that in this “good cop, bad cop” situation, it is always the mother who is perceived by the kids as “bad.” “With Drew and I, it always depends on the situation but we try to achieve some sort of balance, depending on the behavior we have on a particular day,” Iya said.For Neri, she is always the stricter one than Miranda, who tends to give in sometimes, but if he sees there is something wrong, he will get angry. “Chito seldom gets angry but if he does, there is something wrong already, and sometimes, the people who don’t get angry that much can be scary.”However, Neri and Iya are glad that they have supportive husbands who help them carry through all their sacrifices in tending to the children. The validation they get from their kids when they are told that they are “the best Mommy” makes all the sacrifices worthwhile.For Maya Leander, Marketing Head of Philusa Corp., makers of Babyflo, kids nowadays are quite different compared to their generation, especially at the onset of social media, that whenever there’s something about a parent supposedly maltreating a child, as Iya said, “Bantay Bata agad,” in reference to the child welfare program launched in the late 1990s.For her, effective communication with the children remains the best and most positive way when it comes to disciplining children of today’s generation, compared to before when strict parents mete punishments such as making kids kneel in mongo beans, salt or grains of rice and the most feared one, which is the father’s belt.Iya admitted that at first, she resorted to smacking, but stopped it immediately after discovering that it’s not working. “Every day is a new day and if you discover that something is not working, then change it. Also, we Moms suffer bad days, and it’s hard to control your emotions if you’re having a bad day when it comes to disciplining the children so you have to really exercise restraint consistently.”Neri is thankful she has a husband who is not only supportive but also totally objective when it comes to seeing things differently and in dealing with challenges when it comes to raising children, and in any other aspect of life.For Iya, the biggest challenge for her was when she became a mother for the first time. “No matter how much you prepare, you’ll never understand how your life drastically changes the moment you give birth. The days and nights that follow were something that I wasn’t really ready for. But with the kind of support system I had, the burden became lighter and I started to enjoy the days and nights taking care of the kids.”For Maya, she believes that parenting is instinctive no matter how much information we get from others, and that mothers should not be pressured since parents will learn parenting as they go through it.“As parents we have dreams for our children, for them to be successful in life and fulfill their ambitions despite all the challenges. But my ultimate dream is that parents can help their children find their inner joy, or as what the French say, the ‘joie de vivre,’ the joy of living. That is something that they can bring all throughout their lives because a happy child will be a good child. And this is the mission of Babyflo, to bring joy to all Filipino babies and young children, being a trusted ally by mothers in raising their children.”"

To do this, they aim to provide Filipinos with the necessary support through direct selling as they work toward financial success and healthy living.“The responsibility of reaching one million families rests not only on me but on every single member of the company and on each of our distributors worldwide”, Kevin Guest stated. “Despite the differences in our roles, we each play a vital part in nurturing the healthiest family on earth – not only physically but also mentally. Therefore, dedication and collaboration are necessary.”Cherry Ampig affirmed the readiness of the brand to step up to this challenge especially since they are approaching their 15 year in the country. “Throughout USANA’s 15-year stay in the country, it has worked its way toward becoming the leading vitamins and dietary supplement locally. This has been made possible through our rigorous efforts of creating relevant programs and exceptional incentives while also ensuring the overall wellbeing of our direct sellers. With the right motivation, I am positive that USANA Philippines would be able to live up to this challenge presented to us.”Relatedly, business leader and USANA Philippines Ambassador Francis Kong highlighted the vital role USANA plays in the local direct selling landscape, especially in terms of alleviating the lives of Filipinos. The experience of selling USANA’s products allows room for self-discovery and growth. This largely impacts the lives of its distributors, especially aspiring young entrepreneurs, since they are exposed to the reality of managing a legitimate business and the character it requires to succeed.“USANA is a legal, legit and robust business that provides budding entrepreneurs the chance to discover aspects of themselves and help them attain success in their direct selling journey”, Francis said. “This is a great opportunity for entrepreneurship, and it provides training and maturing for people. It will develop their character.”"

Go highlighted the importance of Republic Act No. 11959, known as the Regional Specialty Centers Act. He principally sponsored and is one of the authors of the measure, which was signed into law by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr. on August 24.“Masaya po ako na priority din ito ni Pangulong Bongbong Marcos,” he said, noting that the act garnered a unanimous 24-0 vote in the Senate.“Lahat ay sumuporta dito dahil na-explain natin ng mabuti na makakatulong talaga ito sa mga kababayan nating mahihirap,” he elaborated.This legislation aims to decentralize specialized medical services, making them accessible across all regions.“Nabanggit ko parati na tulad yung mga taga-Zamboanga ay pwede na po sila… may paglalagyan na doon ng Heart Center,” he said, emphasizing the hardship people from remote areas face when seeking specialized healthcare in Manila.“Alam naman natin napakahirap pong pumunta dito sa Maynila. Wala silang pamasahe — ‘yung mga pasyente,” he continued.On the budgetary front, Go stressed the need for adequate funding to establish the specialty centers under the law. He pointed out that while a more substantial fund is expected for 2025, thanks to other sources such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) support, budget for next year must be made sufficient to ensure proper initial implementation of the law. On the other hand, Go continues to advocate for more Super Health Centers which are designed to focus on primary care, consultation, and early detection, further strengthening the healthcare sector in the country especially in grassroots communities. Free consultations would be handled by municipal health offices, local government units, and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) through its Konsulta program.”Ito pong Super Health Centers makaka-complement po ito sa programa ng PhilHealth, sa Konsulta package ninyo,” he said.Services offered in Super Health Centers include database management, out-patient, birthing, isolation, diagnostic (laboratory: x-ray and ultrasound), pharmacy and ambulatory surgical unit. Other available services are eye, ear, nose, and throat (EENT) service, oncology centers, physical therapy and rehabilitation center and telemedicine.The senator also addressed the need for a comprehensive assessment to ensure there are no personnel shortages and the Super Health Centers operate effectively.“Tama yung sinabi ni Senator Loren (Legarda) kanina, importante po ay ma-assess nang mabuti para masiguro na hindi magiging… magkakaroon ng kakulangan sa personnel, baka hindi po kayanin ng LGUs,” he cautioned.Finally, Go also emphasized the vital role of Malasakit Centers in providing medical financial aid to indigent patients all over the country. “Marami sa mga mahihirap nating kababayan ang umaasa po sa tulong ng gobyerno kapag sila ay na-oospital,” he said, urging for the centers’ continued efficient operation to benefit the nation’s impoverished citizens.Malasakit Centers bring together representatives from the Department of Social Welfare and Development, DOH, PhilHealth, and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office. These one-stop shops aim to support impoverished patients in reducing their hospital costs to the least possible amount.Go is the principal author and sponsor of RA 11463 or the Malasakit Centers Act of 2019, which institutionalized the Malasakit Centers program.As of now, 159 Malasakit Centers are operational across the country, poised to assist with patients’ medical expenses. The most recent center was inaugurated at Bislig District Hospital in Bislig City, Surigao del Sur, an event Go attended on September 15.The DOH reported that the Malasakit Center program has already provided assistance to more than seven million Filipinos so far.

In a single interventional suite, the new machine will allow medical practitioners to perform cardiac angiogram, angioplasty, coiling of the brain and radiologic intervention procedures among others. The new machine can deliver fast, clear and consistent 3D imaging of vital organs of stroke patients. Bleeding can be visualized in a short span of time which is vital in the treatment of stroke cases. This can lead to better patient outcomes in cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformation cases. The new machine was unveiled in a simple ceremony last Sept. 12, 2023. The ceremony, led by PHMC-LP Chairman and CEO Dr./BGen. Antonio L. Tamayo and PHMC President Richard M. Tamayo, started with a Thanksgiving Mass at the hospital chapel. This was followed with the blessing of PHMC-LP’s new catheterization laboratory which will house the new ARTIS Icono machine. The Thanksgiving Mass and Blessing was also held to commemorate the birth anniversary of the late Dr. Jose De Guzman Tamayo, Grand Patriarch of the Perpetual Help System and father of Dr./BGen. Antonio Tamayo.“With our newest and state-of-the-art system, we hope to level up our services to our patients. This is part of our mission here in the PHMC-LP. To provide our patients the very best in medical care through a combination of advanced medical technology and our brand of quality and personalized care by our highly qualified medical personnel,” Dr./BGen. Tamayo said.Host of proceduresThe new catheterization laboratory is capable of a host of procedures including transradial coronary angiogram, transfemoral coronary angiogram, cerebral angiogram, coiling of aneurysm, permanent pacemaker implantation, angioplasty, peripheral angiogram, peripheral stenting, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), transarterial chemoembolizaton (TACE), and percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD).The ARTIS Icono is currently undergoing calibration and testing before it is commissioned to serve the hospital’s clientele.The Perpetual Help Medical Center-Las Pinas is one of the best-equipped medical centers in southern Metro Manila with a capacity of 215 beds.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/10/01/bong-go-reminds-filipinos-to-remain-vigilant-vs-nipah-virus-amid-outbreak-in-other-countries/,Bong Go reminds Filipinos to remain vigilant vs. Nipah virus amid outbreak in other countries ,"Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, called on the Department of Health (DOH) and other relevant agencies to implement stringent measures to prevent the potential spread of the Nipah virus (NiV). In response to these concerns, DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire reassured the public that there is no Nipah virus outbreak yet in the country. “Maraming eskwelahan ngayon are suspending classes or shifting to virtual (classes) because of increasing flu-like illness happening among students. In Cagayan de Oro (City), meron pong nagsuspende ng klase and apparently may kumalat na Nipah virus yung concern. Upon verification with our regional epidemiological and surveillance unit in Northern Mindanao, wala po silang confirmed na Nipah virus in relation dun sa kumakalat na balita,” shared Vergeire during the health budget hearing on Thursday, September 28. “Dito ho sa Pilipinas, wala po tayong detection. Meron po tayo nung huli, noong 2014 sa Sultan Kudarat, where there are a number of individuals in the community na na-detect ito. Pero sa ngayon po, wala tayong nade-detect,” the health official reassured. The Nipah virus, as identified by the World Health Organization (WHO), is a zoonotic illness that can be transmitted from animals to humans. What sets it apart from other diseases is its high fatality rate, ranging from 50 to 70 percent. This means that it poses a significant risk, affecting three to four out of every five infected individuals.The primary mode of transmission for Nipah virus infections is direct contact with sick pigs or their contaminated tissues. The virus can also be transmitted through unsafe contact with pig secretions and tissues. This highlights the importance of maintaining good hygiene and proper handling practices within the livestock industry.Meanwhile, outbreaks of the Nipah virus have occurred in countries like Bangladesh and India, where people fell ill after consuming fruits and raw date palm juice contaminated with the urine or saliva of infected fruit bats.“Mga kababayan ko, nais kong paalalahanan ang kahalagahan ng kalusugan at kaligtasan natin laban sa anumang health threats tulad nitong Nipah virus (NiV). Sa panahong ito, hindi natin dapat kalimutan ang mga hakbang na kinakailangan upang mapanatili ang ating kalusugan at kaligtasan mula sa anumang panganib,” stressed Go. “Huwag kalimutang sumunod sa mga payo ng mga eksperto sa kalusugan. Mahalaga ang tamang hygiene, katulad ng paghuhugas ng kamay, at pagsusuot ng masks kung kinakailangan. Maiiwasan natin ang pagkalat ng sakit kung tayo ay magiging maingat,” he continued. Recognizing the need to strengthen the healthcare system in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Go has filed bills proposing the creation of the Virology Science and Technology Institute of the Philippines (VIP) and the Philippine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).“Malaki ang naging epekto sa buhay natin sa COVID. Maraming pagbabago, marami tayong natutunan. Lessons learned ang mga ito. Hindi natin alam kung kailan darating ang bagong pandemya sa buhay natin. Mas mabuting maging proactive at mas handa tayo,” he said.Senate Bill No. 195, as outlined, envisions CDC as the primary organization entrusted with the leadership of initiatives aimed at managing and preventing infectious diseases. Its core responsibilities encompass the formulation of policies and standards, disease surveillance and detection, data collection and analysis, public health communication, as well as research and evidence synthesis, all geared towards mitigating the transmission of communicable diseases within the nation.“Ibig sabihin mas kontrolado natin, alam na natin at ang mga data ay mas kumpleto. So, ito po ‘yung tinatawag na proposed Center for Disease Control and Prevention Act. Napaka-importante po ma-maintain natin ang active surveillance of diseases dahil, alam nyo, nabigla tayo noong COVID-19,” Go pointed out.Meanwhile, according to the proposed SBN 196, the VIP will serve as a specialized hub for virology-centered investigations, research, and technical coordination across the entire network of virology laboratories nationwide. Under this proposed legislation, VIP will offer guidance for the establishment and operation of testing, reference, and biosafety laboratories at Levels 1, 2, 3, and 4 in various regions throughout the country.Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/09/30/bong-go-reminds-doh-to-release-healthcare-workers-allowances-and-benefits/,Bong Go reminds DOH to release healthcare workers’ allowances and benefits,"Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Health, has once again called upon the Department of Health (DOH) to ensure the timely release of necessary allowances for the country’s healthcare workers, in accordance with the law considering their sacrifices and dedication throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Go reminded DOH Secretary Teodoro “Ted” Herbosa during a Commission on Appointments (CA) hearing on Tuesday, September 26, that some healthcare workers have not yet received their allowances. He likewise urged DOH to implement a more efficient and streamlined process to expedite the release of allowances for healthcare workers in accordance with the law. “Marami po talagang mga backlog pa po na mga payables ng health emergency allowance. Yung mga HEA nila na hindi pa nababayaran, baka may mga backlog pa po from the previous years. Kaya parati akong nananawagan sa DBM, sa Department of Health na bilisan natin (ang paglabas) nito,” urged Go. “Pasado naman ito sa Kongreso noon. Ipinasa natin ito. Napakaliit lang po niyan na halaga (para) sa sakripisyo na ginawa nila para sa ating bayan sa panahon ng pandemya. The senator likewise stressed that the least the government can do is to ensure that healthcare workers receive the allowances they rightfully deserve without delay. Go emphasized the importance of continuously supporting the frontliners even after the state of public health emergency had been lifted.Go is one of the authors and co-sponsored Republic Act No. 11712, which grants continuing benefits and allowances to healthcare workers during public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. Public and private healthcare workers covered by the law are entitled to HEA for every month of service during a state of public health emergency based on the risk categorization.Previously, Go expressed his gratitude to President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr. for showing his unwavering commitment to the welfare of healthcare workers. The senator specifically praised the President for urging the prompt release of the much-needed COVID-19 emergency allowance during his second State of the Nation Address (SONA) last July.“Natutuwa at nagpapasalamat tayo na napakinggan ng ating Pangulo ang mga hinaing ng ating healthcare workers at tinugunan niya ito sa kanyang SONA. Even with the lifting of the State of Public Health Emergency, unahin po natin ‘yung mga medical frontliners natin na nagsakripisyo para sa ating mga kababayan,” Go said.Earlier, Go also stated that “with or without the State of Public Health Emergency, the government should fulfill its obligations to protect the lives of Filipinos, safeguard their health, and give what is due to them, especially to medical frontliners.”Moreover, Go also previously expressed his support for the proposed Salary Standardization Law 6, which aims to increase the salaries of government workers, including medical professionals in the public sector. “Healthcare workers have been facing enormous challenges on multiple fronts. Apart from the physical demands and risks of treating COVID-19 patients, they have also grappled with emotional and mental tolls, and many have had to cope with the loss of colleagues and patients alike,” expressed Go.“As co-sponsor and author of Salary Standardization Law 5 during the 18th Congress, sana po ay magkaroon pa ng bagong Salary Standardization Law 6. I’m one with the government in seeking to provide another increase in salaries for those working in the public sector,” he added. Image credits: Being business-savvy should be fun, attainable and A+.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/09/29/makatimed-teams-up-with-singapores-healthcare-network-parkway-hospitals/,"MakatiMed teams up with Singapore’s healthcare network, Parkway Hospitals ","Philippines’ premier hospital, Makati Medical Center (MakatiMed), recently signed another global partnership for the continuous advancement of its medical services, and ultimately, its patient care. This time, it is with Parkway Hospitals Singapore — a healthcare network under the region’s largest private healthcare provider, IHH Healthcare Singapore, which operates four SG hospitals similarly accredited by the Joint Commission International (JCI). The partnership encompasses what they call the Physician Exchange Program, making it possible for the two healthcare providers to work collaboratively in terms of patient consultations (mainly through telemedicine) on a case-to-case basis. It also warrants procedure demonstrations and live surgery observations. Parkway Hospitals also committed to further supplementing the education and training of MakatiMed’s healthcare staff, from its physicians and nurses to hospital administrators alike. On top of Clinical Education and Healthcare Innovation, said training will also involve Leadership and Management Development which allows for study visits and exchange programs, as well as Benchmarking which includes performance reviews. The beginning of this partnership between MakatiMed and Parkway Hospitals was marked with a contract signing on September 25, 2023 held at MakatiMed. Representing the Philippine hospital were Co-presidents and CEOs, Saturnino P. Javier, MD and Arnold C. Ocampo who are also the hospital’s Medical Director and Chief Finance Officer respectively. IHH Healthcare Singapore, meanwhile, was represented by Chief Commercial Officer Jeffrey Law and Country Manager Vincent Lai. Also present in the gathering were the following MakatiMed leaders: Head of Liver Unit Madalinee Eternity Labio, MD Director of Medical Services, John Vincent G.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/09/29/puerto-princesa-city-mayor-urges-parents-to-get-kids-vaxxed-vs-cervical-cancer/,Puerto Princesa City Mayor urges parents to get kids vaxxed vs. cervical cancer,"The City of Puerto Princesa through the leadership of its Mayor Lucilo R. Bayron is committed to increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage in the country by launching the first-ever school-based immunization program in Palawan benefiting 3,000 female public school learners. Hon. Bayron called on parents to immunize their daughters to protect them from vaccine-preventable diseases like HPV and cervical cancer. “To the parents of Puerto Princesa, the most common cancer among women is breast cancer and the second most common is cervical cancer. There is no vaccine against breast cancer but fortunately, there is one against cervical cancer. I encourage all parents and guardians to give your consent for your daughters to be vaccinated against cervical cancer because this is the best way to protect your children from getting the disease and ensure their healthy future.” HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer among women. Every day in the Philippines, a woman dies every 2 hours from cervical cancer. It is also the second most common type of cancer among Filipinas. In fact, almost 8,000 Filipino women are diagnosed with this disease annually. But the good news is cervical cancer is vaccine-preventable. Administering HPV vaccine to children, especially to young girls, is recommended so that they gain protection even before they are exposed to HPV.Under the immunization program of the government, HPV vaccine is administered to grade 4 girls aged 9 to 14 years old who are attending public elementary schools. The HPV vaccine is given in two doses, with the second dose administered to the student 6 months after the first dose. Prior to administering the vaccine, parents’ consent is first obtained after a series of engagements with parents and school officials. For the year 2023, the Department of Health (DOH) has procured 1 million doses of HPV vaccines that will help provide cervical cancer protection to 500,000 girls aged 9 to 14. However, under the national expenditure program for fiscal year 2024, the budget for HPV vaccination efforts has been reduced from said 1 million doses in 2023 to 750,000 doses next year. The reduced allocation is expected to reach only 375, 000 students for the incoming year. This will cover HPV vaccination access across 15 regions in the archipelago excluding Region 2 and MIMAROPA. In line with this, Mayor Bayron said “It is unfortunate to hear that two regions, one of which is MIMAROPA, will not receive HPV vaccine allocations. Maybe the National government has enough reasons why that must be the case.” Cognizant of the fact that thousands of parents rely on public school HPV vaccination programs to protect their children from cervical cancer, Mayor Bayron is open to investing to intensify HPV vaccine coverage among his constituents. “On our part, the City Government of Puerto Princesa through my leadership is willing to put up the necessary budget given the demand and need for HPV vaccines in order for us to vaccinate our womenfolk and children using our own funds.” As part of the ongoing budget negotiations, the DOH is calling on lawmakers to increase funding for its HPV vaccination program. According to the World Health Organization, it is possible to eliminate cervical cancer in 2030, if HPV vaccination is scaled up to cover 90% of adolescent girls; 70% of women receive HPV-based screening; and 90% of women with pre-cancer and invasive cervical cancer receive adequate treatment. Gaps and challenges nevertheless persist which if unaddressed, will prevent the Philippines from achieving the global 90-70-90 targets. This is why Puerto Princesa’s initiative to introduce the HPV vaccination in its health care services in schools is an important step in building a more resilient system that can fortify the community’s protection against vaccine-preventable diseases like cervical cancer."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/09/28/bong-go-calls-for-increased-health-budget-as-country-navigates-toward-pandemic-recovery/,Bong Go calls for increased health budget as country navigates toward pandemic recovery,"Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Health, emphasized in an interview on Tuesday, September 26, the urgent need to bolster the Department of Health’s (DOH) budget as the country navigates towards pandemic recovery even amid several existing and emerging public health concerns.“Gaya ng sinabi ko noon, full support ako sa DOH kung ano ang makakatulong sa ating healthcare system,” said Go.He recalled the budget deliberations in December 2019 when there were attempts to cut the budget of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) for year 2020. “Nag-budget hearing noong December 2019, tinapyasan ang proposed budget sa RITM at DOH, di po ako pumayag noon. Dinagdagan pa natin at ibinalik natin ang pondo,” he narrated.This decision turned out to be crucial then, as RITM later played a vital role in COVID-19 testing when the pandemic started in 2020. Go noted that the restoration of RITM’s budget underscored the importance of adequately funding healthcare institutions, especially in unpredictable times.Go’s recollection came at a critical time when DOH is facing a P10-billion budget cut for 2024. The proposed budget cut would bring DOH’s overall budget down to P199.45 billion from P209.62 billion under the General Appropriations Act of 2023.With this, Go argued that the healthcare system needs more, not less, financial support. He then underscored the urgency for increased investment in the public healthcare system.“The more we should invest sa ating healthcare system, dagdagan ang pondo,” Go reiterated.“Para sa akin po, dapat suportahan natin na dagdagan ang pondo ng DOH. ‘Wag pong bawasan, dagdagan pa po,” he stated further.He emphasized that the funds should be used wisely to benefit patients particularly the less fortunate.“Makinabang dapat ang mga pasyente, makinabang po ang mahihirap nating kababayan na walang ibang matakbuhan kundi tayo pong nasa gobyerno,” he said.Go said that those who are wealthy have the option to seek medical care in private hospitals, while the less fortunate are left with no other choice but to rely on public healthcare facilities that rely on government funding.“Ito pong mga helpless, mga hopeless nating kababayan, sila ang unahin natin. ‘Yung mayayaman naman po, di pupunta sa public hospitals ‘yan,” he said.During the Commission on Appointments hearing on the ad interim appointment of Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa which Go presided on early that day, the senator also appealed to DOH to ensure that poor and indigent patients are given utmost attention in public hospitals. Go cited a recent department memorandum signed by Herbosa instructing medical center chiefs to ensure that all patients must be accorded with the available services in Malasakit Centers. The Malasakit Center serves as a one-stop shop aimed at helping particularly poor and indigent patients minimize their medical expenses to the lowest amount possible by collaborating with various agencies offering medical assistance programs. This initiative was institutionalized under Republic Act No. 11463, a law principally authored and sponsored by Go in the Senate. Presently, there are 159 Malasakit Centers spread across the country, and they have collectively provided support to more than seven million Filipinos, as reported by DOH. Moreover, echoing President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr.’s priority of bringing specialized medical services closer to other parts of the country, Go highlighted that he has principally sponsored and is one of the authors of the Regional Specialty Centers Act which was recently enacted into law. The law mandates the establishment of regional specialty centers within existing DOH regional hospitals. Given this, Go reminded the DOH that sufficient funding must be allocated in the coming years for the proper implementation of the law. Moreover, Go also emphasized the need to continue bringing basic health services closer to the grassroots through the establishment of more Super Health Centers nationwide which he had advocated for since the time of former president Rodrigo Duterte. “Ipagpatuloy natin na ilapit ang serbisyong medikal mula gobyerno sa ating mga kababayang mahihirap na walang ibang matakbuhan. The more we should support their health needs, the more na mag-invest po tayo sa ating healthcare system,” Go said.“Huwag po natin silang pahirapan. Marami po sa mga kababayan natin sa iba’t ibang sulok ng Pilipinas na wala silang sariling health facility. Kaya importante na mailapit natin ang serbisyong medikal mula gobyerno sa mga taong nangangailangan nito,” he stressed."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/09/28/novartis-associates-check-their-cholesterol-levels-raise-awareness-on-heart-health/,"Novartis associates check their cholesterol levels, raise awareness on heart health","In observance of Cholesterol Education Month this September, Novartis associates across Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMA) Region are getting their cholesterol tested and engaging key stakeholders to promote awareness on heart health as part of the September Unblocked APMA Challenge.More than 18 million people die of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) every year. CVD is the leading cause of death globally. In fact, CVDs claim more lives than all cancers combined, and a staggering 34 people will have died from a heart attack or stroke in the last 60 seconds alone. CVDs are responsible for a third of deaths in the Philippines.Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the underlying cause of 85 percent of heart attack and stroke related deaths, claiming 15 million lives every year. ASCVD is an umbrella term used to describe a variety of diseases that are caused by the build-up of fatty deposits or plaque in arteries. Many people do not experience any symptoms until the plaque in the arteries unexpectedly ruptures. This may lead to a heart attack or stroke.Almost 40 percent of the adult population is at risk of ASCVD and are too often undiagnosed until a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack or stroke, occurs. What most people do not know is that 80 percent of premature heart attacks and strokes are actually preventable. In APMA, every minute, more than five people die from CVD. Each of them is a parent, child, sibling, friend or colleague. The emotional impact of each life claimed is significant.The Unblocked Movement is an initiative co-created with partners and supported by Novartis to bring patients, their loved ones, healthcare professionals and healthcare systems together in a shared mission to “unblock” barriers to heart health. The company’s goal is to drive a movement through building sustainable partnerships across the healthcare ecosystem to raise awareness, and spur action and behavioral change toward achieving better heart health.“At Novartis, we are working towards a generational decline in death due to CVD in the decades to come. We envision a world where ASCVD is eliminated so patients can live longer and healthier lives, and families are not prematurely robbed of their loved ones. To turn our vision into a reality, we are making a lasting commitment to pioneering groundbreaking treatments, forging productive partnerships with healthcare systems, and finding innovative approaches to tackle major ASCVD risk factors for the larger population,” said Joel Chong, Country President, Novartis Healthcare Philippines.By working with patients, healthcare professionals (HCPs), healthcare systems, and policymakers, the movement aims to “unblock” the barriers that impede CVD patients from improving their health outcomes, starting with ASCVD. The Unblocked Movement is driven by a collective voice, cocreated and activated in individual countries with external stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem to transform heart health across the local population.“In support of Cholesterol Education Month and through the Unblocked Movement, let’s empower HCPs, business partners, patient groups, and health care systems, to drive action and conversations around heart health. We will spread the word on the importance of getting our cholesterol checked, make conscious choices, and prioritize health for ourselves and our families,” said Dr. Sheila Lim, Ad Interim Chief Medical Officer, Novartis Healthcare Philippines.The Unblocked Movement has three pillars.Too often, patients normalize cholesterol and delay seeking medical help or postpone committing to dietary changes, exercise, and treatment. The Unblocked Movement aims to create awareness and mobilize patients to prioritize their heart health through collaboration with patient organizations advocating for heart patients or loved ones living with CVD. The Movement will work to overcome barriers of indifference, lack of urgency or information to transform heart health in communities throughout Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa.Novartis is supporting cardiologists and other physicians in their efforts to treat CVD patients more effectively. Through the Unblocked Movement, the company aims to identify and address non-clinical barriers, supporting HCPs to increase their capacity to adopt clinical guidelines and ultimately, improve the quality of care to their CVD patients.The Unblocked Movement aims to unblock heart health for a healthier society. By partnering with healthcare systems to make ASCVD a healthcare priority, Novartis can help reduce CVD-related deaths, and deliver better health outcomes for patients through effective ASCVD management and treatment."

She also welcomed the partnership with the PHAPCares Foundation as one of the ways to improve the health and well-being of the people in the province.“We commend the Provincial Government of La Union for prioritizing the health of its constituents, aligned with its vision of bringing sustainable and inclusive development that improves the quality of life of its people. PHAPCares is constantly committed in further improving healthcare access together with like-minded collaborators both in the public and private sector,” said Ramin, who is also Country President of AstraZeneca Philippines.The PHAPCares Foundation has a long history of partnerships and programs seeking to establish healthy and resilient communities within the UHC framework. From 2015, the Foundation has reached 5,000 families, and served 25,000 individuals in its medical outreach activities in several communities, including La Union. It has trained around 639 responders under the Earthquake and Landslide Search and Rescue Orientation Course (ELSAROC) with the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). Since 2003, the PHAPCares has also donated medicines worth over P1 billion for use in institutions and communities affected by health emergencies and disasters.Under the MOA, the La Union Provincial Government and the municipalities of Bauang and San Juan will ensure the sustainability of health services by supporting the program. They also committed to provide support staff and logistics during the conduct of health advocacies as well as the training on ELSAROC.The LGUs will also provide support during the conduct of the medical outreach in the sites, and in the oral health initiatives for kindergarten pupils in schools in the participating barangays.For their part, PHAPCares will provide the expertise to support the health advocacy on HIV, WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene), and oral health and other disease in the LGU sites. PHAPCares will also help train community health volunteers and provide the necessary materials to support the barangay health workers.Additionally, PHAPCares will undertake the monitoring and the evaluation of the performance of the LGUs in the implementation of its sustainable healthcare and social development projects under the program. The organization will also assist in the capacity building in LGU sites as well as provide assistance to participating barangay health stations.“Now is the time to fully roll out the Universal Health Care Act, so that no one will be left behind when it comes to health. We are here to augment the resources of the LGUs as they make the leap to improving the health outcomes of residents living in the province,” said Dr. Maria Rosarita Siasoco, PHAPCares Executive Director.Earlier, the La Union Provincial Health Office and PHAPCares provided crucial health services to select communities within the province amid extreme weather disturbances brought about by the southwest monsoon in August. Residents from two barangays that are considered Geographically Isolated Disadvantaged Areas (GIDA) in Bauang Municipality, received doctor consultations, laboratory tests, and minor surgeries right within their communities.“We are very glad that we have formed a partnership with the PHAPCares Foundation. It is not easy for the residents in these remote barangays to go to the town for their medical needs. The Foundation brought with them several medicines for use of the people. To us, it is simple. If the effects of Universal Healthcare is felt by the constituents such as the farmers and fisherfolks, then we can say it is a success,” La Union Provincial Health Office Head Dr. Ed Posadas said."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/09/28/filipino-brand-comes-up-with-solutions-to-address-menopausal-problems/,Filipino brand comes up with solutions to address menopausal problems,"MOST women experiencing perimenopause and menopause, especially in a very conservative society like the Philippines, find it difficult to express or even share what’s going on in them once their menstrual cycle ends.According to Pro Age Solutions’ Chief Advocate and Founder Claudine Viquiera, what makes their journey to this critical period in their lives even harder is the fact that there’s no local community that addresses the problems that they encounter.In fact, she said during their recent launch event in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig that Western countries, particularly in the United States, have just started having communities that support these women since there’s still a stigma and taboos that exist when talking about menopause.“What more in our country! So locally, I tried to search. But there’s really none,” she said of her personal experience when she finally reached the gateway to aging just earlier this year. “Sometimes we just turn to our friends or relatives to talk about it. But still there’s some degree of embarrassment whenever the topic of menopause is brought up. I guess it’s because when you say menopause, it’s a sign that you’re aging. Again, a negative notion about agism.”MENOPAUSE is a natural part of aging. It is a point in time when a person has gone 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period due to the gradual loss in ovarian follicular function and the decline of hormones.One of these hormones is called progesterone. When its production in the ovary becomes low, the regular menstruation comes with heavy bleeding that could possibly be prolonged, per restorative dermatologist Dr. Jean Marquez.When the male sex hormone—the testosterone—that women also have in small amount decreases, there is a loss of libido or sexual desire, she noted. But the estrogen is the major culprit in menopause, she pointed out.“Actually, most of the symptoms that we see in menopause is because of estrogen decline. This is what causes vaginal dryness, atrophy and walls, flushings, sweating, headaches, and memory loss,” Dr. Marquez explained.“The nice thing about this is that these three hormones actually are also being secreted not just by the ovary, but also of the adrenal gland on top of the kidneys. That’s a bonus, so there’s extra supply. Unless you have adrenal fatigue because of too much stress, that doubles the symptoms,” she added.In this crucial stage, most of the women experience various symptoms. One of the most prevalent is skin issues. Some are dryness and itching, wrinkles, acne, hot flashes, and melasma.Because of the changing hormonal levels, menopause also has an impact on women’s mental health. The changes on their skin and appearance are somewhat distressing, thus leading to their loss of self-esteem and confidence.AT the age of 55, Viquiera has found a new purpose in life after she hit the menopausal stage last January.Confronted by the silent yet growing stigma on perimenopause and menopause, plus the lack of support system from the society, she took it as a challenge to help address the problem that her fellow women encounter.This led her to create a community of women in midlife to have a safe space to talk about their experiences while eradicating the taboos and stigma about these stages of aging. This is part of the #OwnYourAge movement, which is a call to women to embrace and be proud of their age as it is a natural part of who they are.“Once I went through the journey, I knew I had to do something because for me it felt very isolating. Even if I had my closest friends and relatives whom I could talk about, there’s still a symptom that’s very unique. So that’s the part that made me feel isolated,” she recalled.“I want to have a safe space for women where they can talk about menopause, what they go through on the problems, and go with it without any judgement. That there will be people who will support you, and you’ll be able to talk about your own journey. It’s my advocacy to build a group of women who will support other women. That’s how Pro Age Solutions was born,” she cited.Throwing her support to the community, health and fitness advocate Cory Quirino pledged to spread the gospel of wellness and share the wisdom and the liberating truth of pro-age. She said: “We are one, we are together, and we will move forward together. And we win and inspire other women to become like us: empowered, inspired and ageless in our challenges in life and in our attitude towards life itself.”PRO Age Solutions has not only led to a support community, but also a pioneering advocacy brand for perimenopausal and menopausal relief and overall wellness. The event witnessed the launch of its first product line that could remedy the skin—the major organ of the body that that has the visible results of these inescapable periods of aging.“Perimenopause and menopause, basically, is the time when changes happen in a woman’s life. It doesn’t happen at a certain age, which is usually in the 30s. But we’re seeing it more in younger women because of the environmental toxins that we are encountering in all over,” underscored Dr. Joel Lopez, regenerative medicine expert and chief medical ambassador or Pro Age Solutions.“I’m glad that we have these solutions that work synergistically with the products that we actually do recommend in our practice. And they include, of course, the basics, which is nutrition,” he added.The skincare products of Pro Age Solutions are formulated in Korea but are made and tested specifically for Filipinas who are experiencing skin issues due to menopause.“We did not develop it according to the skin of Korean woman living in Korea but based on the results of the research on the weather in the Philippines and the daily routine of Filipino women,” emphasized Veil Cosmetics Research and Development Manager Jacob Park.Pro Age Solutions skincare line includes witty-titled products, such as No Dirty Secrets, a hydrating facial cica cleanser; The Holy Grail, a cica toner; Quench The Thirst, a cica ampoule serum; Eye See Yah, a cica eye cream; Correct Me If I’m Wrong, a spot corrector; Plump Me Up, a cica moisturizing cream; Cool & Chic, a cooling mist; and Be Gentle With Me, a bakuchiol exosome serum.Best applied day and night come, it comes in a starter kit of nine products at only P9,800. It’s now available on Pro Age Solutions’ official website. For more information, tune in to their social media at @proagesolutions on both Facebook and Instagram.Roderick L.

However, it’s too soon to know how transmissible it is, or whether it produces more severe symptoms than older variants, according to a from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/09/08/accelerate-hpv-vaccination-to-save-more-lives-solon/,Accelerate HPV vaccination to save more lives – Solon,"During a recent House Committee on Appropriations hearing to discuss the proposed Department of Health (DOH) budget for 2024, Hon. Angelica Natasha Co of the BHW Partylist and Vice Chairperson of the House Committee on Health expressed that there is a need to double-time on increasing HPV immunization coverage in the country to protect girls and women from cervical cancer.“Cervical cancer is a dreaded disease that claims the lives of 11 Filipinas daily. Furthermore, the cost of treatment has been financially catastrophic for many Filipino families affected by cervical cancer. According to a study by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), cancer patients still pay 15-41% out-of-pocket medical costs despite government subsidies.Recent data shows that the Philippine government spent a staggering P46.63 billion on cancer treatment in 2020 alone. Yet ironically, 99% of cervical cancer cases are preventable through early HPV vaccination of girls as early as 9 years old.In the same hearing, DOH Undersecretary Public Services TeamDr. Maria Rosario Vergeire, mentioned that the Department’s goal is to vaccinate 1 million grade 4 public school girls every year. She also underscored the DOH’s appeal to Congress for a higher allocation for HPV vaccines. The DOH is working to increase the coverage of HPV vaccination in the country. For the calendar year 2023, the Department has acquired 1 million doses of HPV vaccine, which will cover an estimated 500,000 girls aged 9 to 14, or approximately 38% of the nationwide school-aged children target. In the ongoing budget deliberations, the DOH is appealing to Congress for an increased budget for the HPV immunization Program. Under the National Expenditure Program, there is a reduced budget allocations for the 2024 HPV immunization program, which has been slashed from 1 million doses in 2023 to 750,000 doses in the incoming year, estimated to only reach around 375,000 school children next year.While thousands of parents rely on government school-based HPV vaccine programs to have their children protected from cervical cancer, a decrease in government spending for the HPV immunization program would mean lesser vaccine coverage and could potentially put thousands of young girls at risk of developing cervical cancer in the future.This is why Hon. Co, who is a staunch supporter of grassroots healthcare, agreed that prevention through HPV vaccination is a more financially sound and life-saving solution than the lengthy government-subsidized cervical cancer treatments. The House of Representatives began its review of the 2024 national budget in August. The House aims to approve the proposed national budget on or before Sept. 30."

The program has been instrumental in bringing the organization as One AXA in working towards a better future and assisting vulnerable communities worldwide. What’s more, it has also taken strides in increasing access of the female populace to surety products and services through the “Women in Insurance” initiative among other ongoing campaigns and community programs for Eve’s tribe.“Beyond contributing to the business, we are on a mission to empower people to live better lives. Putting the spotlight on women this year lets us fulfill that mission while becoming a trusted partner for women everywhere,” said AXA Philippines Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Bernardo Rafael Serrano Lopez.AS part of the insurer’s women-centric volunteer activities, the company donated a total of 1,200 hygiene kits—surpassing the initial target of 1,000—to women beneficiaries in Binangonan, Rizal; Paco, Manila; and Cardona, Rizal. The beneficiaries, likewise, received 414 liters of dishwashing soap the volunteers personally made. Such activity is in line with AXA’s goal of providing livelihood assistance and enabling more women to become entrepreneurs and start their own businesses. While more than 99 percent of all registered businesses in the Philippines are micro, small and medium enterprises, only 313,608 of them belong to women. This is just close to 30 percent of the total 1.08 million listed establishments, per data of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). Local figures mirror the global picture, wherein merely 33 percent of business owners are women, according to the World Bank in 2020.Meanwhile, women facing hair loss due to medical conditions were uplifted and given high hopes through a donation drive. The donated hair will be transformed into high-quality wigs, empowering the recipients to regain their self-esteem. The week-long goodwill activity also served as a platform to support other social causes, including environmental stewardship and proper nutrition for children.AXA volunteers helped build a 200-square meter urban garden at Nueve de Febrero Elementary School in Mandaluyong City, complementing the company’s advocacy in promoting a circular economy.Then came a follow-through donation of fertilizer from food waste collected at the AXA office. The employees also had the chance to shed blood for a cause with the Philippine Red Cross.THIS year’s AXA Week for Good in the Philippines was participated in by 513 volunteers who devoted 553 hours to carry out 682 acts of volunteerism, making an unfathomable impact on the communities they served.For AXA Philippines Claims Specialist Eirene Maramag, this activity was an opportunity to further her passion for volunteerism while empowering her colleagues to make a difference.“When AXA Week for Good was launched in the Philippines, I was eager to volunteer and encouraged my colleagues to join as well. The joy of giving and making our beneficiaries happy is an experience I’d love to continue sharing with my co-workers beyond the week-long volunteer activities,” she said.The CEO of AXA Philippines shared his plan to sustain the company’s culture of volunteerism and providing inclusive protection for Filipinos. “The immense success of this year’s AXA Week for Good stemmed from the collective passion and dedication of all the volunteers. We look forward to witnessing the continuity of our purpose-driven programs and offerings with the rest of AXA Philippines in the years to come,” Lopez said.Roderick L.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/09/07/bayer-philippines-launches-initiative-to-promote-womens-health-conversations/,Bayer Philippines launches initiative to promote Women’s Health Conversations,"Bayer Philippines Inc. recently launched “Bayer For Her: Conversations of Care,” an initiative designed to shatter the silence surrounding sensitive women’s health issues and buoy up dialogue and proactive measures.The event featured the presence of experts such as Dr. Margaret Cristi-Limson, an OB-GYN and specializes in reproductive medicine, and Dr. Jarische Lao-Ang, a dermatologist. It was also graced by notable figures including Valerie Tan, who served as the event host, Melissa Gohing-Nacino, an athlete and survivor of PCOS, Verniece Enciso, a lifestyle influencer who has battled endometriosis, and Say Tioco, a content creator advocating for contraception.“This project actually has great potential, I believe. It is their opportunity to realize that irregular menses are not normal. Pelvic pain may not be usual. It may actually be a symptom of endometriosis or whatever other gynecologic pathology,” Dr. Limson told BusinessMirror.This lack of clarity at times leads to serious issues being disregarded as “normal” or “simply part of being a woman.”Reproductive health barriers for Filipino women persist, influenced by pervasive gender biases that hinder their capacity to openly discuss and make well-informed decisions regarding their bodies.According to the United Nations Population Fund in the Philippines (UNFPA), the presence of gender biases exist across political, educational, economic, and bodily autonomy aspects, as per recent reports. Alarmingly, a substantial 92 percent of both genders in the country exhibit inherent biases against women, particularly concerning their bodily autonomy encompassing reproductive rights.In a positive development, the utilization of family planning and contraceptive measures among women saw a rise, reaching 8 million in 2020 compared to 7.6 million in the previous year.Nonetheless, a concerning statistic reveals that approximately 44 percent of women still lack the capability to make vital decisions about their own well-being.“With the launch of ‘Bayer For Her: Conversations of Care,’ we continue to raise awareness on women’s health. We know from listening to healthcare providers and patients that it’s not easy to talk about contraception, period pain and related topics in our cultural context,” said Angel-Michael Evangelista, Managing Director and Country Division Head of Pharmaceuticals Bayer Philippines.Dr. Lao-Ang emphasized the physical manifestations of PCOS in women’s bodies such as menstrual irregularity, and infertility, and through androgen excess in the form of seborrhea, acne, hirsutism, and alopecia, and the importance of open communication with doctors.Gohing-Nacino shared that her PCOS diagnosis affected her emotionally, especially when she and her husband were trying to get pregnant.“Our OB-GYN really helped us throughout the process until we found the right treatment and medication to control the symptoms and help with my fertility,” she said.Dr. Cristi-Limson Margaret mentioned that before, endometriosis took years to diagnose. Nowadays, it can be clinically diagnosed, adding that they should “trust their doctors.”For Enciso, the pain she experienced affected her daily routine and social activities. “I couldn’t stand the pain so I finally talked to my doctor and got the diagnosis. He recommended available treatment options that suit me, and I’m glad I sought his professional advice from the get-go, or else I will still be enduring the pain until now,” she said.Tioco also stressed the importance of having a community where women can openly speak about their health concerns and use of contraceptive methods, “women tend to be hesitant when it comes to talking about using contraception because of their fear of being misjudged due to the persisting myths and stigma”.Meanwhile, Tan expressed her enthusiasm for brand-university collaborations, emphasizing their potential to advise and empower younger generations to prioritize their intimate health.She revealed that they actively engage with universities, conducting discussions on sex education and related topics.“So I think it’s amazing to see young women younger than me, they’re so open to talk about anything,” Tan said.In their efforts to promote open conversations about reproductive health, Gohing-Nacino underscored the significance of marriage counseling.She further suggested that the government should incorporate family planning education to ensure a broader outreach in the community.According to Evangelista, “Bayer For Her enables these Conversations of Care with free pop-up clinics over the next two months at selected branches of our partners from Mercury Drug, Southstar Drug, Rose Pharmacy and Watsons.”This is to help more women make informed choices about their own bodies and encourage more women to seek out expert advice on reproductive health."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/09/07/urgent-need-to-address-growing-breast-cervical-cancer-rates-in-apac-cited/,"Urgent need to address growing breast, cervical cancer rates in APAC cited","As cancer rates continue to rise globally, cancers that affect women, specifically breast and cervical cancer, are becoming more widespread and impactful.The incidence of breast cancer is increasing worldwide, and it is now the most common cancer diagnosed in women. More women are also being diagnosed with cervical cancer and are dying from the disease.This has become a major problem in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region where women are heavily affected by both diseases due to factors such as inadequate screening, lack of awareness, and late diagnosis, among others.The APAC Women’s Cancer Coalition said there is an urgent need to address breast and cervical cancer in the Asia Pacific region as it accounts for the biggest share of incidence and mortality of both cancers globally.Taking this into account, the APAC Women’s Cancer Coalition, supported by Roche, commissioned the Economist Impact to analyze cancer policies and programs in six countries in the APAC region—India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Philippines.These countries are bracing for a rise in breast and cervical cancer incidence and mortality that could match or even exceed the expected regional and global averages. Thus, they need to take steps to address this issue and to meet the targets set by the World Health Organization (WHO) to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem and to reduce the incidence of breast cancer. These targets are clearly outlined in the and the .In the Economist Impact report “Impact and opportunity: the case for investing in women’s cancers in Asia Pacific,” the burden of women’s cancer, specifically breast and cervical cancer, is examined in the six countries mentioned. The progress of these six countries in tackling breast and cervical cancer was also assessed across five domains—policy and planning, prevention and screening, diagnosis and resource capacity, treatment and access, and awareness and education.The global, evidence-led Economist Impact conducted an evidence review, formed an advisory board, and discussed with experts to inform the design of the scorecard. Among the experts who contributed to the research are Dr. Corazon A Ngelangel, President of the Philippine Cancer Society, and Ingrid Magnata, Country Program Manager, Jhpiego, Philippines. Jhpiego is an international, non-profit health organization affiliated with Johns Hopkins University.Across all domains, none of the six countries achieved high scores all round. All six countries have room for improvement especially in terms of diagnosis and resource capacity.The Philippines scored moderately low in policy and planning, diagnosis and resource capacity, and treatment and access. It scored moderately high in the other two domain—prevention and screening and awareness and education.Before giving recommendations, the study cited the problem usually observed in these countries which is late diagnosis. Both breast cancer and cervical cancer are often diagnosed too late “leading to direct and indirect healthcare costs, higher burdens for patients, and higher mortality rates.” And once a diagnosis is made, patients still face difficulties in accessing care and the treatment they need.The report identified several key steps to help the six countries reverse the trend and achieve the WHO cervical cancer and breast cancer targets.“Countries must demonstrate greater political will and leadership, and implement and update national elimination plans and strategies to align with WHO targets for cervical and breast cancer.”The other recommendations are “enhance performance tracking by building immunization, screening and patient outcome registries for cervical and breast cancer; Focus on primary prevention by rolling out national immunization programs [HPV immunization for cervical cancer] and secondary prevention by rolling out organized population-based national screening programs [for both cervical and breast cancer]; and Referral and treatment pathways for patients should be clear and well-defined.”Likewise, governments should make women’s cancers a priority in their policies in order to achieve national goals for vaccination, screening, and treatment. Governments and global funding organizations should also develop and implement effective and sustainable funding mechanisms.Services and programs should be focused on the needs of the patient and should be tailored to the specific needs of the population in which they are being delivered.The report also recommended that these countries consider integrated, holistic approaches to address the challenge of limited resources and capacity.By implementing these measures, emerging economies in the Asia-Pacific region will be better equipped to address the increasing burden of breast and cervical cancer, as well as a range of other health challenges."

A total of 1,205 respondents from 18 to more than 65 years old participated in the survey.Based on the data collected, it was found that 40 percent of the respondents go for their annual medical checkups, 33 percent only get a checkup when they feel unwell, 15 percent rarely do so, 7 percent undergo medical checkups every two to three years, and 4 percent never get a checkup.The survey also aimed to determine how the respondents’ behaviors in getting their health checked are influenced by their age, monthly income, and source of money.This is especially relevant given the government’s Universal Health Care (UHC) law, which prioritizes addressing this issue. The UHC law offers coverage for consultations and tests to individuals who may encounter financial barriers when accessing healthcare services.According to the study’s analysis of age demographics, the frequency with which individuals undergo yearly medical checkups varies across age groups.Specifically, the study found that 51 percent of those aged 45 to 54 receive annual checkups, followed by 50 percent in the 35 to 44 age range, 41 percent in the 25 to 34 age category, 38 percent in the 55 to 64 age range, 31 percent of respondents aged 65 and above, and 24 percent of those aged 18 to 24 undergo yearly medical checkups.“The resolution of this health concern is contingent upon consistent and informed guidance from our government especially since we have the Philippine Universal Health Care Act (UHC) which has benefits especially for seniors,” said Atty. Nic Conti, Chief of Public Affairs of Capstone-Intel.With regards to the income of the respondents who undergo annual checkups, 8 percent of them have monthly income of P65,000 or higher, 12 percent have an income ranging from P35,001 to P65,000, 10 percent have an income ranging from P20,001 to P35,000, 6 percent have an income ranging from P10,001 to P20,000, and 3 percent reported an income below P10,000.For respondents who earn less than P10,000 monthly, 32 percent seek medical checkups only when feeling unwell, 26 percent rarely have health checkups, and 16 percent have annual health checkups.However, more than 50 percent of those with a monthly income of P65,000 or more have an annual health checkup.“In a move towards providing universal health care, the Universal Health Care Act was signed by the government in 2019. In 2021, the House of Representatives passed House Bill 9072, also referred to as the ‘Free Annual Medical Checkup Act,’ which is linked to UHC. The appropriate implementation of these initiatives is crucial in ensuring that our fellow citizens benefit from these measures,” added Conti.The research study also further demonstrated that a considerable percentage of individuals who undergo annual checkups are PhilHealth members, with a proportion of 36 percent, whereas only 3 percent of non-members reported undergoing such checkups.Moreover, among those who receive checkups every two to three years, 5 percent are PhilHealth members, while only 2 percent are non-members.For individuals who undergo medical checkups only when they feel unwell, 25 percent are PhilHealth members, whereas 8 percent are non-PhilHealth members.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

Called the “Pandesal Forum,” the event welcomed health and economic experts to dissect the issue, citing recent available data on diabetes and obesity rates in the Philippines as sources. The forum sought to understand why diabetes and obesity rates in the country continue to rise despite efforts to reduce consumption of sweetened beverages through the excise tax. The panel of experts invited to the forum included According to data from the FNRI, the per capita consumption of sweetened beverages has decreased significantly from 2015 to 2019. This decline was most evident among urban households. The Sweetened Beverage Tax was implemented in 2018 and imposed a P6.00 tax per liter on beverages which contained added pure sugar or non-caloric sweeteners like aspartame, or a combination of both. A tax of P12.00 per liter was imposed on beverages which contained High Fructose Corn Syrup or HFCS. In addition, consumption of sweetened beverages has decreased across all age groups in the Philippines, with adolescents and adults showing the sharpest decline. In contrast, Ms. Patalen shared obesity rates among Filipinos have only increased from 2015 to 2018, and even up to 2021. Among those aged 20 and above in the country, 38.6% are overweight and obese. This data translates to 17.8 million Filipinos who are overweight, and 5.6 million who are obese. The data for Diabetes rates in the Philippines shows the same story. From 2013 to 2019, the number of Filipinos with borderline diabetes has more than doubled, translating to about 17.6 million people. In 2018 when the Sweetened Beverage tax was proposed, the reasons cited for the tax included helping curb obesity and diabetes rates. As the data shows, the number of Filipinos with obesity and diabetes continues to rise, despite the imposition of the excise tax on sweetened beverages. The FNRI is currently conducting the 2023 National Nutrition Survey, which is held every 5 years, which will reflect more updated obesity and diabetes rates, among other health measures. Another member of the media forum panel was . Dr. Rivera is also the Chief Economist of Oikonomia Advisory & Research, Inc. In his discussion he noted that it is important to discuss the proposal to increase excise taxes on sweetened beverages because of the impact it may have on inflation, particularly on food. “As of the moment, inflation rates continue to be high, but we see this declining by the end of 2023 up to 2024,” explains Dr. Rivera. “However, if the excise tax on sweetened beverages is pursued, it will have an impact on consumption among middle and lower classes of consumers. This is because of the role that sweetened beverages play in their daily lives. If additional taxes are imposed on sweetened beverages, the prices of these will increase and will make purchasing them harder for consumers to purchase. While we understand that the goal of the excise tax is to limit consumption of sweetened beverages, we should also ask the question if these consumers have alternatives to these sweetened beverages.” Dr. Rivera goes on to explain that while upper income classes may find alternatives easily, those in the lower brackets may not be able to do so, and as such the excise tax will impact their daily lives. If a tax is imposed, prices will similarly increase and consumers will bear the brunt of the impact. He adds that perhaps the government can find other ways to increase revenues other than an excise tax. In addition, he proposes that if the government would like to limit consumption of sweetened beverages, projects to help improve physical activity like public open spaces to counter diseases can be given focus. “We promote exercise because it serves as a hub to change lifestyles,” shares 3 panel member Prof Callanta is also a faculty member of the College of Human Kinetics of the University of Philippines Diliman. He relates that when people start doing exercise, they start to notice other aspects of their health, like the need to diet and even to sleep better. While it is common knowledge that having a balanced diet and being physically active are the keys to avoiding illnesses, Filipinos do not always practice both. He clarifies however that while workouts are great for keeping fit, everyone should just start moving every day to be healthy. “We should all just start moving, start looking at our plates, adapting the “mind over plate,” he adds. He also supports the idea of walking more or even biking, taking the stairs, and avoiding using transportation if possible. Professor Callanta adds that to help curb obesity and diabetes, there is a need to make nutritious food more affordable. “What we want to see is for healthy food to be more affordable especially for the poorer portions of the grand population,” he explains. He also adds that improving physical activity rates among Filipinos should also be a priority of the government by promoting more walkable places in communities. The forum ended with the conclusion that, as the data shows, to help reduce obesity and diabetes rates the solution lies not in taxation but in the need for proper diet and exercise.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/09/06/bong-go-to-push-for-increased-budget-for-cancer-care-supports-cancer-fund-initiative-for-ofws/,Bong Go to push for increased budget for cancer care; supports Cancer Fund initiative for OFWs,"Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Health, has expressed his full support for Senate President Juan Miguel “Migz” Zubiri’s suggestion to establish an endowment fund for cancer-stricken overseas Filipino workers (OFWs).This initiative is in memory of the late Migrant Workers secretary Ma. Susana “Toots” Ople, who was a staunch advocate for the welfare of OFWs and who passed away recently while battling breast cancer.Meanwhile, Go’s support for the Cancer Assistance Fund (CAF) represents a sustained commitment, building upon his previous efforts to strengthen the fund. During the budget deliberations for the 2023 General Appropriations Act (GAA), Go was instrumental in securing a P500 million allocation for CAF under the Department of Health.Initially, the proposed budget for 2023 had no allocation for the Cancer Assistance fund. However, both the House of Representatives and the Senate managed to add substantial amounts to fund the program, thanks to the collective efforts of lawmakers. “I am always one with you in the fight against this disease,” Go said. “In fact, during the budget deliberations last year, I pushed for an additional budget for the cancer assistance fund to subsidize the cost of cancer treatment, including the needed diagnostics and laboratory tests,” he added.Looking ahead to 2024, Go aims to double the current allocation to further strengthen the fund and extend help to more cancer patients. This is in line with the National Integrated Cancer Control Act (NICCA), under Republic Act No. 11215, which includes CAF as an essential component.Section 20 of NICCA ensures that cancer patients have access to free financial assistance for various needs, including screening tests, specialized treatments, diagnosis, palliative care, and medications.Beyond CAF, Go has also been a driving force behind the recently signed RA 11959, or the Regional Specialty Centers (RSC) Act, which he principally sponsored and of which he is one of the authors in the Senate. The newly enacted law aims to create additional specialty centers in various regions, including cancer centers, thereby ensuring that Filipinos have access to specialized medical services without the need to travel to Manila.“Prayoridad ko po bilang chairman ng Committee on Health ito pong establishing regional specialty center. Maglalagay po ng mga specialty center sa mga DOH regional hospital sa buong Pilipinas,” said Go previously.“It’s a multiyear plan po. Halimbawa, kung may problema sa heart, kidney, lung, neonatal, mental, ito pong mga ortho sa mga may karamdaman sa buto, cancer. Ilalagay na po sa lahat ng DOH regional hospital sa buong Pilipinas para ilapit po natin ang serbisyo medikal sa ating mga kababayan,” explained Go.The establishment of these regional cancer centers is a monumental step in making specialized cancer care more accessible to Filipinos, especially those residing in far-flung areas. Go said that it not only complements the existing CAF but also enhances the overall healthcare infrastructure, making it more responsive to the needs of cancer patients.Go’s efforts in healthcare have not gone unnoticed. He has received recognition from several organizations, including the Philippine Cancer Society and the Philippine Society of Oncology.“Ang laban kontra sa kanser ay laban nating lahat. Patuloy tayong magkakaisa upang maabot ang ating pangarap na maging cancer-free ang ating bansa,” Go emphasized.“With every fund, service, and support we provide, we take a step closer to better and just health for everyone,” he concluded.

The share of THE to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at current prices was 5.5 percent in 2022.Of this amount, PSA said 44.7 percent was accounted for by Filipino households. This share was higher than that of the government, whose share was 44.2 percent of the total.“Out of the total health spending, Current Health Expenditure [CHE] contributed 93.4 percent, while the Health Capital Formation Expenditure [HK] shared 6.6 percent in 2022. CHE declined by 1.5 percent in 2022, while HK posted a 0.2 percent growth in the same year,” PSA said.Based on PSA data, the share of households in CHE was also higher than the share of the general government in 2019. In that year, households accounted for 48.8 percent of CHE while the general government accounted for 40.8 percent of CHE.In 2022, the share of households to the CHE was again higher than the general government—which included the share of the central government, accounting for 20.9 percent of the total, and the Department of Health (DOH), a share of 15.5 percent.General government also included the share of local governments at 9.7 percent and social security agencies at 13.6 percent, which was mainly extended by PhilHealth.The PSA’s derived indicators also showed the out of pocket payment (OOP) bay households reached P501.785 billion in 2022, a 5-percent growth from the P478.04 billion posted in 2021.On a per capita basis, PSA data showed health spending in 2022 amounted to P10,059.49, which was lower by 2.7 percent compared with the amount recorded in 2021 at P10,341.73.

Pharmaceuticals Division General Manager Dr. Diana M. Edralin, Roche Philippines Patient Journey Chapter Lead (PJCL) Mr. Raymon Cayabyab, Ayala Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (AC Health) president and CEO/ Healthway Medical Network (HMN) Chairman Paolo Borromeo, and HMN President & Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jimmy Ysmael signed a joint Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) recently in a ceremony at the soon-to-be-inaugurated 15,000 sqm Cancer Care Hospital in Taguig. “As we seal our partnership with Roche to be our catalyst for transformative healthcare, we also reaffirm our commitment to providing access to Filipinos to healthcare and to life-saving medicines. With cancer being one of the top causes of morbidity in the country, we are highlighting it as one of the focal points of our Connectd Care Circles (CCCs), HMN’s innovative model of care, which latches on the network’s capability of delivering high-quality and connected healthcare services to patients through a multidisciplinary healthcare team, ensuring coordinated care throughout the patient journey,” said HMN President & CEO Jimmy Ysmael.Roche (Philippines) Inc. is an affiliate of Roche, one of the world’s largest biotech companies with innovative solutions in the following focus areas: cardiometabolic diseases, hematology, infectious diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, neuroscience, oncology, ophthalmology, rare diseases, respiratory and women’s health.Healthway Medical Network (HMN) is wholly owned by the Ayala Corporation under Ayala Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (AC Health), delivering healthcare through various formats across the country. With a patient base of 3 million, HMN provides integrated services across the full continuum of care through its 12 outpatient centers, four (4) full-service general hospitals, one (1) surgery center, and over 200 corporate clinics nationwide, and its upcoming cancer hospital, slated to open later this year. The groundbreaking partnership enables sustainable and patient-centric advancement of cancer healthcare services to Filipino patients through Roche’s innovative solutions, transformational healthcare expertise, and HMN’s country-wide network. “We are proud to partner with Roche, one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the oncology space. Via the Roche Access Program (RAP) Plus initiative, access to Roche’s oncology medications will now be extended to the entire Healthway Medical Network patient base, starting with four (4) general hospitals, ambulatory surgical center, and of course, our Healthway Cancer Care Hospital,” AC Health President & CEO Paolo Borromeo said.RAP Plus is Roche’s patient support program in recognition of the predominantly out-of-pocket Philippine healthcare setting to help ease the burden of cancer patients through financial assistance, pharmacy services support, and transport services. RAP Plus’ availability in HMN facilities nationwide will also help patients eliminate additional treatment costs since they do not have to travel outside of their provinces in order to receive treatment. “Today marks an important milestone in the history of caring for cancer patients in our country as Healthway and Roche formalize this partnership. This unique landmark alliance will bring advanced and high-quality cancer services closer to Filipinos. Through your state-of-the-art healthcare facilities and access centers and our different patient support programs and initiatives, we are positive that we will help bring equal opportunity to these services, whether executives in a city or farmers in the countryside, ” Roche General Manager Dr. Diana Edralin said.The partnership will also kick off Roche and HMN’s mutual health-system shaping goals, such as helping with the capability of healthcare professionals (HCPs) in managing cancer patients, improving early cancer detection with screening and diagnostic programs, disease awareness and education campaigns, supporting public and/or private institution reimbursement or payment coverage for diagnosis and innovative treatment of cancer, and empowering patients and providing end-to-end innovative solutions throughout their cancer patient journey.With the critical transformational initiatives stemming from the alliance of these forward-thinking institutions, Filipino patients from all over the country can look forward to a more unified patient referral pathway with improved access to high-quality, innovative medical care.

This new legislation marks a significant stride towards bringing advanced medical care closer to Filipinos, particularly those residing in underserved rural areas, Go said in an interview with DZRH’s “Balansyado” on Tuesday, August 29. The law mandates the establishment of regional specialty centers within existing Department of Health (DOH) regional hospitals. It stands as a testament to the commitment of the government to uplift the nation’s health infrastructure.“Napirmahan na po itong bill na ito, ganap na batas na po itong Republic Act 11959 o ang Regional Specialty Centers Act na tayo po ang principal sponsor at isa sa mga authors nito sa Senado. At babanggitin ko rin po, si Senate President Migz Zubiri ay principal author nito at isa rin po sa mga sponsors. Dahil priority rin po ito ng ating mahal na Senate President Migz Zubiri,” Go shared. “Bilang inyong principal sponsor, ako po ang nag-defend nito sa Senado, nakakuha po tayo ng boto na 24-0 sa Senado dahil sang-ayon na rin po sa ating mga kasamahan na makakabuti po ito para sa lahat, makakatulong sa mahihirap. In fact, ‘yung Minority Leader natin si Senator Koko Pimentel ay bumoto agad nang ma-explain natin sa kanya kung ano ang buting idudulot nitong tulong sa mahihirap nating kababayan at siya naman po ay nakuntento at sumangayon kaya nakakuha tayo ng 24-0 na boto sa Senado,” he cited further. Go, an advocate for improved healthcare services, highlighted the importance of the law and emphasized how it aligns with his priority measures to fortify the health sector and address the longstanding challenges faced by many Filipinos in accessing specialized medical treatment.“Isinulong po natin ito bilang chairman ng Committee on Health at bahagi ng ating adhikain na mapangalagaan ang kalusugan ng mga kababayan natin lalung-lalo na po ang mga mahihirap, helpless, hopeless at walang malalapitan maliban sa gobyerno,” Go cited. “Ano po itong specialty center? ‘Di ba po ang Heart Center natin nasa Quezon city? ‘Di ba po ang Lung Center natin nasa Quezon City? Ang NKTI nasa Quezon City? Ang mga kababayan nating nasa Zamboanga po kailangan nilang magbiyahe, pumunta pa sila ng Maynila at kadalasan sa kanila wala pong matirhan, wala pong bahay, wala pong pamasahe para magpaopera sa puso. Kailangan pa nilang bumiyahe ng napakalayo, wala silang kamag-anak dito. Ngayon po plano ng gobyerno, it’s a multiyear plan, at institutionalized na po ito dahil batas na po, from 2024-2028 ang target ng Department of Health ay magkakaroon po ng iba’t ibang specialty center sa bawat regional hospital,” he explained. This approach, according to Go, aims to minimize the burden on patients who would otherwise need to travel long distances, often at great expense, to access specialized care in metropolitan centers. With these regional specialty centers strategically placed, Filipinos in remote provinces will have better access to services such as cardiac care, cancer treatment, neurosurgery, and other specialized medical interventions, the senator added. “Pero importante po nito ay hindi na nila kailangan magbiyahe pa ng heart center. Importante po nito hindi na nila kailangang bumiyahe ng Quezon City para magpaopera po ng puso. Doon na po mismo sa kanilang mga existing DOH regional hospital. Iyan po ang tinatawag nating Regional Specialty Center,” he continued. The legislation is an integral part of the health-related legislative agenda of the Marcos administration, as outlined in the Philippine Development Plan 2023 to 2028.Considering the evolving landscape of healthcare reform, the Regional Specialty Centers Act assumes a crucial role by addressing the critical issue of specialized medical care.“Isa po ito sa paraan na ilapit natin ang serbisyo medikal sa ating mga kababayan. Ilapit natin ang serbisyo medikal sa ating mga kababayang mahihirap na walang matakbuhan kung hindi ang mga government hospitals… Pero para sa mga mahihirap nating kababayan napakaimportante po nito dahil iyan po ang kanilang lalapitan po talaga, itong mga government hospitals natin. The more we should support it, the more na mag-invest po tayo sa ating healthcare system,” Go said. “Sabi ko nga pera n’yo naman ‘yan, pera ng tao ‘yan, ilapit po natin ‘yan. Huwag po natin silang pahirapan. Marami po sa mga kababayan natin sa iba’t ibang sulok ng Pilipinas na wala silang sariling specialty center o mga ospital sa lugar nila na may kakayahan na mag-opera sa puso. Ang hirap pong magkasakit, ang hirap pong magpaopera, bawat araw, bawat minuto ay napakahalaga po. Kaya importante na mailapit natin ang serbisyong medikal mula gobyerno sa mga taong nangangailangan nito,” he stressed.Image credits:"

It’s also about finding the right balance in the things shaping your life, including your mental health, interpersonal relationships, and the aspirations that push you to continue moving forward every day.If you’re looking to start taking care of yourself more holistically, here are some habits you can give a shot. Take these small steps today on your way to living your best life.Be more mindful of what you eatThe food you eat fuels you to take on your roles every day, may it be at home, the workplace or your community. As such, it’s important to make sure that whatever you eat and drink is good for your body. There are 101 ways to incorporate whole and nutrient-rich foods like fruits and vegetables as well as good sources of protein and fats in your meals without making them “boring” or repetitive. You can still enjoy a good, hearty meal without the guilt while being creative and resourceful with your ingredients.Redefine self-careIt’s time to stop equating self-care to just pampering and indulgence, and relate it to ways that one can improve their well-being and cope with the stresses of everyday life. For example, in order to have adequate and quality sleep every night, you might need the right pillows or sheets, a 5-step bedtime routine or essential oils—you can consider that as self-care. Going out with friends or even just yourself to unwind is another form of self-care that isn’t talked about just as much.Learn to manage stressUndeniably, life can be stressful at times. And while we cannot avoid it, there are many ways to alleviate stress, which can also manifest physically when not managed. Remember, it’s okay to take a break when you feel like you need one! Meditating and practicing mindfulness regularly allow you to stay in the present and to learn to reduce negative emotions amidst stressful situations. Having an outlet like a journal or a creative hobby is also a healthy way to destress from a long day.Stay activeOne of the most effective (and free) ways to get an endorphin rush is through exercise. Endorphins are a feel-good hormone that helps you reduce stress, relieve pain, and improve your mood. Aside from making you feel good, being physically active allows you to manage your weight, minimize health risks, and make your body stronger.Exercising doesn’t have to be a burden. If going to the gym is not for you, there are other ways you can try that can cater to your personal preferences and routine just like running. Running is one of the best cardio exercises you can do and it’s very easy to add to your daily routine. Whether it’s indoors using a treadmill or outdoors around your neighborhood, its benefits to your physical and mental health are unprecedented.To embrace the first step in their journey toward their best life, over 5,300 participants composed of seasoned runners, beginners, kids, families, and people from various backgrounds gathered at the starting line of Run for Wellness last August 13, 2023 at UP Diliman, Quezon City. This event was held jointly by Southstar Drug and Maxicare to kick off their pioneering wellness initiative.Run for Wellness, now in its 12th year, aims to promote physical health and mental well-being among Filipinos. This was the first time Run for Wellness featured a Metro Manila leg in addition to the traditional location in Naga City, Camarines Sur, which is scheduled for September 10, 2023.Southstar Drug and Maxicare, as champions of health and wellness, have partnered to support consumers in their journey toward a healthier and happier life.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/08/31/smoking-cessation-is-key-to-fighting-lung-ailments-experts/,Smoking cessation is key to fighting lung ailments–experts,"Do you know that the second most common type of cancer in the Philippines after breast cancer is lung cancer?Lung cancer may spread or metastasize to lymph nodes or to other organs in the body, such as the brain. However, cancers from other organs may also spread to the lungs.To increase awareness about lung health among Filipinos, the month of August was designated as the National Lung Month in the Philippines based on Proclamation No. 1761 on July 24, 1978.Other most common lung diseases include:In 2020, the Department of Health (DOH) said that there were a total of 19,180 newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer in the Philippines. “These new cases represent 12.5 percent of the total number of new cancer cases in 2020,” DOH Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said in an email response.Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) GLOBOCAN 2020, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the Philippines, resulting in 17,063 deaths in 2020.Certain factors can increase the risk for developing cancer, including:About 23 percent of male deaths and 10 percent of female deaths are caused by tobacco (17.5 percent overall).“Over 20 percent of non-communicable disease-related deaths [ex: ischemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, COPD, lung cancer, etc.] in the Philippines, are attributable to tobacco use,” the DOH chief added.Also, over 112,000 Filipinos die from tobacco-related diseases each year.“The best way to protect your lungs is to quit smoking. If you’ll quit smoking, you also protect your family from secondhand smoke,” said Dr. Jaimie Galvez Tan, former DOH Secretary and a trustee of HealthJustice Philippines said.HealthJustice, Social Watch Philippines, Parents Against Vape, and Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development are pushing for the passage of smoke-free bill that will strictly regulate and prohibit smoking in public areas, among others. The bill, filed in Congress but awaiting committee hearing, aims to sustain the continuous decline of smoking prevalence in the country.“We need to safeguard our nation’s future generation by ensuring that stronger regulations are in place and are properly implemented,” said Romeo Dongeto, Executive Director of the Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development, the Convenor of Child Rights Network. To maintain good lung health, Dr. Galvez Tan said that one should exercise regularly.“Through exercise we can increase how efficiently the body uses oxygen. Protect yourself against infection for, in some cases, it can damage the lungs. Also, we should reduce indoor pollutants like chemical solvents, asbestos, and secondhand smoke,” Dr. Galvez Tan stressed.Different people have different symptoms for lung cancer. Some people have symptoms related to the lungs while some people whose lung cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasized) have symptoms specific to that part of the body. There are those who just have general symptoms of not feeling well. Most people with lung cancer don’t have symptoms until the cancer is advanced.The DOH said that the most important way to help prevent developing lung cancer is stopping or avoiding cigarette smoking. The individual may consult a doctor for help in smoking cessation. People with an increased risk of lung cancer may consider annual lung cancer screening using low-dose CT scans.Lung cancer screening is generally offered to people 55 and older who smoked heavily for many years and are otherwise healthy. “For a more thorough assessment of your cancer risk, ask your doctor,” the DOH said.Image credits: Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

I will be taking barley for the rest of my life because I want to participate in Iron Man events until I reach 80,” Marcelo said during the 16th anniversary celebration of Santé.According to healthline.com, barley is a very healthy grain which is rich in vitamins, minerals and other beneficial plant compounds. It is also high in fiber which can lead to better digestion, reduced hunger and weight loss.“Forget about the business. Santé is certified organic. We are the first Filipino company and the second outside of New Zealand to be certified organic. We have our own manufacturing facility in New Zealand and we produce quality barley,” Marcelo added.Over a period of 16 years, Santé has successfully expanded its operations globally, increased its business owners’ reach and numbers to keep up with the demand for barley nutraceuticals, and diversified its product line and offerings to its customers and business partners.With its mantra of Live More. Do More., Santé continues its goal of offering Filipinos high-quality barley grass products to enhance their health and well-being, while also serving as a preferred partner for achieving a better life. Within 16 years, Santé has dominated the barley grass industry and successfully risen up to be on top, positioning the brand as the barley authority that Filipinos can take pride in.This was the theme of Santé’s 16th Anniversary, which kicked off with a press conference at the Santé International Headquarters in Silang, Cavite on August 14, 2023.During the press conference, Marcelo unveiled Santé’s expansion plans to tap more markets globally, emphasizing Santé’s strength as a Filipino brand with an impactful global presence, currently operating in 10 countries. Marcelo noted that the pandemic has led to a demand for health and wellness products, and this trend will continue even with the country’s economy on a path to full recovery. Santé is fully prepared to address this demand by further expanding its business owners’ reach through retail and global expansion.“We are more than just a Filipino company when we uplift our business partners, we are also uplifting the communities they belong to through our quality products and services,” Marcelo said.Santé, at its core, is a Filipino company, from its foundation to its operations, the brand aims to help fellow countrymen wherever they are across the globe. “It’s definitely a brand that the Philippines can be proud of, and our track record speaks for itself,” Marcelo added.Also present in the press conference was Santé’s Chief Operating Officer, Mike Sibayan who highlighted the strength of Santé’s business operations and supply chain. With direct selling at its core, business partners are provided a self-owned entrepreneurial platform with flexible working hours, additional income, and the benefits of actual employees in a standard company. “This, along with Santé’s global presence, our partners are exposed to various cultures and learning best practices from a diverse set of individuals all united under Santé’s vision of a healthy lifestyle and financial security make the brand the premier employer of choice,” Sibayan added."

For example, the local government unit of Caloocan got a big boost when it partnered with Nestlé Philippines for the first time in promoting its health and wellness program for its residents. No less than Caloocan City Mayor Dale Gonzalo Rigor “Along” Malapitan felt elated that the food manufacturing giant decided to partner with them to enable them to scale up the program.“To be honest, the local government unit cannot do it alone. Although Caloocan City has been implementing its health and wellness programs before, the entry of Nestlé Philippines has made a big difference because it could serve more beneficiaries in our city,” Malapitan told the BusinessMirror in an interview on August 20, 2023 at the sidelines of the Family Wellness Festival at the Caloocan Sports Complex.“We’re delighted to collaborate with Nestlé Philippines to bring the Family Wellness Festival to our community. This is an opportunity for families to come together and enjoy a day of fun, health, and togetherness,” he added.Joey Uy III, Senior Vice President and Head of Corporate Affairs of Nestlé Philippines, said the company believes that the foundation of good nutrition begins with the family at home. “We at Nestlé Philippines believe that good nutrition starts at home. We are bringing Nestlé Family Wellness Festival closer to communities as we strive to provide residents of Caloocan City with the nutrition information and wellness tips that can help them improve their health,” Uy said. He said Nestlé Philippines believes that partnering with local government units that share similar goals with their ongoing nutrition programs will make a huge impact as it will better inform and encourage residents of Caloocan City to prioritize their family’s well-being.During the Family Wellness Festival, Caloocan City also provided comprehensive health and wellness services to its constituents such as X-ray services, fluoride treatment, and HIV testing services. There were also free haircuts and massages offered and environmental awareness games.Meanwhile, the Batang Kankaloo children also enjoyed the story-telling activities led by Caloocan First Lady and Chairperson of Cultural Affairs and Tourism Department, Aubrey Malapitan. Even the fur-babies of Caloocan benefited from the day of health and wellness with the veterinary consultations and anti-rabies vaccine offering for pets.Nestlé Philippines also invited experts from its partner organizations to share their insights on key topics that touch on the overall wellness of individuals, families, and the planet.For its part, the Department of Science and Technology – Food and Nutrition Research Institute (DOST-FNRI) talked about promoting nutrition and health for the family, while the Department of Agriculture shared tips on starting your own veggie garden based on its Food Always in the Home (FAITH) program.This was followed by a cooking demo to further promote “sarap-sustansya” meals for the family. A representative from non-profit organization Pure Oceans then gave a talk about caring for the environment and how our collective action as its stewards can make a positive impact on the wellness of our planet. “In striving to be the “Kasambuhay for Good,” we are committed to helping educate Filipinos about the importance of good nutrition, health, and wellness, especially for our children. We will continue to offer nutritious, affordable, and accessible food and beverage options, and help drive education on healthier food and lifestyle choices. Through partnerships with local government units who share in this mission, we hope to be able to help more and more Filipino families live happier and healthier lives,” added Uy.Rizal Raoul S.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/08/31/fighting-dengue-in-quezon-city-through-slay-the-swarm-strategy/,Fighting dengue in Quezon City through ‘Slay the Swarm’ strategy,"YEAR in and year out, the outbreak of dengue, especially during this time of the year, is no longer news to many. In fact, it will be abnormal if there are no reported dengue cases in the Philippines.The Department of Health (DOH) already reported around 80,318 cases of dengue in the country as of July 15, 2023, and these are just the reported ones. Almost 1,000, or about 1.23 percent, experienced severe dengue, and 299 already died for a case fatality rate of around 0.37 percent, the DOH added.FOR Quezon City, the so-called “City of Stars” being a hub for culture, entertainment and media, dengue continues to be a concern, according to Dr. Marlon Molano, Medical Officer from the Quezon City Health Department. From January 1 to August 24 this year, there are now 2,156 dengue cases in the city, as reported by the Quezon City Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit. Last year, the city tallied a total of 2,558 dengue cases. “We are already near the total from last year and we still have four months to go so most likely the number will still go up,” says Dr. Molano.And out of these total number of cases, Dr. Molano said four people have already perished. In the city, the age group with the highest number of reported cases is from one to 10 years of age or the pediatric population, and 27 percent of the total experienced severe cases.On the other hand, the top five barangays with the most number of dengue cases in the city are Tatalon, Pasong Tamo, Bahay Toro, Tandang Sora, and Commonwealth, with Districts 1 and 3 identified as dengue hotspots.Dr. Molano said the city’s health department does not let up in its anti-dengue efforts with year-round campaigns such as integrated vector management and disease surveillance efforts in the city down to the barangay levels.“We also make sure that the staff at our health centers are trained to identify, diagnose, and manage dengue cases. Our health centers also have rapid diagnostic test kits that are readily available there and they are given for free. We do NS-1, Dengue Duo tests for free, especially for Quezon City residents, and free clinic lectures daily to increase awareness about dengue,” he said.He also added that they continue to partner with private groups and companies to raise the awareness level about dengue, especially among the youth. “That is why we continue to harness the power of social media in order to bring more awareness about dengue, especially to our younger population,” Dr. Molano stressed.EVERY year, as soon as the number of dengue cases begin to spike, health authorities, including partners from private institutions, will do the rounds of provinces and cities to communicate and spread awareness about the dangers of dengue. These include conducting seminars and lectures, mostly in barangay halls or health centers.However, health, wellness and beauty brand Watsons decided to do it differently through “Slay the Swarm,” a health advocacy campaign that uses fun, eye-catching art installations and fashion phenomenon performances as a way of educating the community regarding dengue in the most unconventional way.Watsons’ Customer Director Jared De Guzman said “Slay the Swarm” is a first-of-its-kind spectacle done at the heart of Quezon City, which is the Quezon Memorial Circle, that gives them the opportunity to showcase their complete and wide range of anti-dengue, including immunity-building products in a unique, fun and family-friendly way.“The campaign is a partnership between Watsons Philippines and the local government of Quezon City because of the continued rise of dengue cases. People were so focused on the Covid-19 pandemic but when we saw the numbers, there were more dengue than Covid-19 cases and there are more people dying due to dengue than the dreaded virus,” De Guzman stressed.The concern on dengue remains to be awareness, but Guzman said that at Watsons, they found a way to educate people but not in a boring and traditional way. “Since our customer base is younger than others, we decided to combine fashion, art and style with our health and beauty products and present it via a fashion show which is unlike any other fashion show wherein we combined nice and modern fashion attire with mosquitoes. It was a good way for us to educate on how dengue can be prevented in a fun, family-friendly and more accessible way of putting out information without the usual scare tactics that people are used to.”At present, De Guzman said Watsons Philippines is working with the government, particularly the DOH, across all health concerns but gave special attention to dengue this August since it is also Dengue Prevention Month. “We found out that in this area of the Quezon Memorial Circle, the number of dengue cases is very high so we decided to prioritize the area and we chose Quezon Memorial Circle because there are a lot of people here every weekend, mostly families, so this is a perfect place where we can educate them and at the same time entertain them.”First in the strategy, he said, is to make people aware that they can prevent dengue by taking care of the environment, removing stagnant water and keeping their area clean. That’s still part of the education process. “At the same time, we are espousing people to look at our anti-dengue products like insect repellants, disinfectants, including immunity-boosting products such as vitamins and supplements because these can help as well in the fight against dengue.”De Guzman also emphasized that they are looking at the approach they are doing now, assess it and see if it can be applied in the future in other areas."

Any responses that did not meet the qualifications were excluded from the findings.The survey showed that 77 percent of the of surveyed dentists observed positive outcomes in their practice since implementing AI.Of surveyed dentists, 35 percent have implemented AI in their dental practice;81 percent of dentists have a positive attitude towards AI applications in dentistry;62 percent of surveyed dentists agreed that some of the operational tasks in dental clinics could be performed by AI.Additionally, 57 percent of the surveyed dentists believe that AI could replace certain tasks currently performed by dentists; 55 percent of dentists believe that the advancements in AI could result in potential layoffs in the dental care industry in the next five years; 68 percent of the patients believe in the potential benefits of AI applications.Amongst surveyed patients, 65 percent of patients were open to receiving dental treatment or diagnosis that incorporates AI in the future; 42 percent of the surveyed patients feel comfortable receiving AI-based dental treatment, while the majority remain neutral about this matter.According to 72 percent of patients, the “lack of human interaction during treatment” is their primary concern regarding the integration of AI in dentistry.The report added that only 10 percent of surveyed patients are willing to pay extra for dental treatment or diagnosis that incorporates AI technologies.Of the 250 dentists interviewed, 66 percent were female practitioners. The next 33 percent were males, and only 1 percent identified neither as male nor female.On the AI acceptance in dentistry, 35 percent of surveyed dentists have implemented AI in their dental practice.These respondents find AI valuable for enhancing their clinical practice, streamlining workflow, and improving patient outcomes. Additionally, these early adapters highlighted the areas of their dental practice where they had incorporated AI.The dentists have cited improvements post-AI incorporation that emphasize the efficiency that comes with the technology.Likewise, AI makes it easier to analyze patient medical records and tailor personalized treatment.When asked what concerns they had most about AI in dentistry, a whopping 67 percent of dentists expressed fears about the privacy and security of their patients’ data, as well as the security of their own practicePractitioners have expressed concerns about the potential breach of relevant laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), due to AI’s heavy reliance on patient data. This worry stems from the potential compromise it could pose to their practice.Here’s a list of dentists’ top five concerns concerning AI in the dental space:The Dentaly.org said that the AI in Dentistry Survey sheds light on the remarkable progress and potential that AI holds for the future of dental care. It also indicates the perceptions held by dentists and patients on the subject.According to the results obtained, 35 percent of dentists are applying AI to their practice, and the number is likely going to increase in the next five years.“Although the pace of adoption is rather slow, most practitioners agree that AI has its benefits, including faster and more efficient workflows, predictive analytics for patient outcomes, improved accuracy in diagnosis, enhanced treatment planning, and personalized treatment options,” the survey said.Image credits: Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/08/31/mabuhigh-from-bangkok-pinoys-join-thailands-legal-cannabis-trade/,‘Mabuhigh’ from Bangkok: Pinoys join Thailand’s legal cannabis trade,"Grass is “greener” in Thailand—literally to mean marijuana, or its chic-sounding scientific name, cannabis. It is now a popular, lucrative product in the old Buddhist kingdom once known as Siam, following its decriminalization on June 9, 2022.Its medical use by patients with a prescription has been legal since 2018. (Doctors from different countries, including the Philippines, have attested to evidence that cannabis eases symptoms of autism, epilepsy, and various types of cancer, including pain management.) In 2022, the Thai Food and Drug Administration officially removed the cannabis plant from its narcotics list. Possession, cultivation, distribution, consumption, and sales of all cannabis plant parts are legal.But the change in administration is creating a bothersome buzz. A story on Aljazeera on June 3 () echoed the concern of Thais happy with legal cannabis that the liberation of the misunderstood plant might be short-lived:At the center of attention is Pita Limjaroenrat, the prime minister-in-waiting whose Move Forward Party (MFP) scored an upset to come first place in last month’s general elections.While MFP is widely viewed as the most liberal of Thailand’s political parties, cannabis advocates say it is leading the drive to rein in recreational use, casting a pall over the country’s multibillion-dollar cannabis industry.“What made you change so much?” Ganja TV said in a recent post accompanying a video of the MFP leader hailing the potential of cannabis businesses to fund schools and provide “immense opportunities” for Thailand.Pita now says the cannabis boom should be put on pause to curb widespread recreational use until the incoming government can pass a proposed Cannabis Act to draw clear lines on where the drug can be sold and consumed.However, Thailand’s constitutional court has suspended Pita’s assumption of duties following charges that he owned shares in a long-defunct media company.In the meantime, it’s a reality that Thailand’s top tourism industry is even more busy with visitors from all over the world flocking mostly to its capital to “light up” and get high without worry.Chuck Manansala was in Bangkok recently and told BusinessMirror he felt “completely safe” while observing the scene. The co-founder of Masikhay Research—a Philippine non-government organization (NGO) advocating for scientific studies, clinical data, and anecdotal experiences on the efficacy, safety, and benefits of cannabis as medicine—attended the opening of Mabuhigh Maharlika, a cannabis dispensary owned by a Filipino couple living in Bangkok.BusinessMirror had an online chat with Manansala about his observations on the use and commercial impact of legal cannabis.BM: You were recently in Bangkok to attend the opening of a cannabis dispensary owned by a Filipino who shares the growing global advocacy of promoting cannabis as medicine. Tell us about your visit to Mabuhigh Maharlika.Manansala: Mabuhigh Maharlika is a medical cannabis dispensary in Bangkok. It is owned by the Filipino husband-and-wife team of Arthur and Guadalyn Reyes, and other investors. It is the first Philippine-inspired cannabis dispensary in Thailand. It sells locally (Thai) grown and imported cannabis flowers. Its cannabis extracts for medical use are sourced from a Thai University. Arthur and Guadalyn are fellow advocates who are with Sensible Philippines. They chose a location far from the center of cannabis shops in Bangkok for lower operational costs and to help create support from residents in the area. The shop itself is themed with Filipino icons and symbols, including the use of baybayin script. The vibe is typically Filipino: cool, relaxed, and happy.BM: Thailand is the first Southeast Asian country to legalize the recreational and medical use of cannabis. This has led to a boom in dispensaries and even casual selling on the streets. What are your observations on how ordinary Thais are taking this development—considering the harshness of their country’s drug laws in the past?Manansala: The speed of change in Thailand’s cannabis laws and regulations is astounding. Ordinary Thais are okay with cannabis for medical use. For a long time, it has been part of their research on medical plants, and is categorized as herbal medicine. However, there is still a debate regarding recreational use. Only those who are 20 years old and above can buy medical cannabis. Pregnant women are prohibited from using medical cannabis. The recently held elections in Thailand saw winning parties calling for cannabis to be relisted as a dangerous drug. This is a huge step backward from decriminalization. Thais who are now in the cannabis business and farmers who plant cannabis are opposing the move.BM: What about the Thai police, what’s it like for them in Bangkok—have you seen cops not minding people smoking weed on the streets?Manansala: Technically, the recreational use of cannabis is still illegal in Thailand. So is smoking cannabis in public. But these prohibitions are ignored and there are no police in, say, Khaosan Road, where cannabis is openly sold on the streets and in a multi-store cannabis shopping center. –BM: What’s your view of news reports of people feeling overwhelmed and having a “bad trip” over the potency of some cannabis strains in Thailand?Manansala: This is not a prevalent issue as far as I have observed it. This happens mostly to new cannabis consumers who try edibles. It takes time for edibles to take effect. Inexperienced users become impatient and they take another bite. By the time the effect kicks in, they are overdosed. The newbie who usually suffers from nausea and paranoia is rushed to a hospital for treatment. Most cannabis shop owners insist on having naïve consumers take the product only under their guidance and supervision to avoid adverse reactions and “bad trips.”BM: What insights have you gained from your visit to Mabuhigh Maharlika and interaction with its owner, which your group, Masikhay, and other Filipino organizations, especially MedCann, can use to advance the issue of legalization?Manansala: A Filipino congressman once insisted that legalizing medical cannabis will transform Filipinos into zombies. But my observational trip to Bangkok was a revelation. I did not see zombies. I only saw people having a good time, listening to music, partaking of food. On Khaosan Road I felt no sense of danger even if it were full of people and music blared. I felt completely safe. However, we must not underestimate the potency of various cannabis strains and its possible adverse side effects.Thus, when the Philippines decides to decriminalize cannabis, policies should be in place to prevent young people and pregnant women from using it, to penalize illegal sales and distribution, to allow cultivation with clear regulations, and to impose regulations to prevent abuse.BM: What are your thoughts if Thailand’s totally unexpected stance on cannabis were to happen in the Philippines?Manansala: If it happens, we will be creating a potential multibillion cash product that can help alleviate poverty in the Cordilleras and other provinces which can grow high-quality cannabis. It can make the Philippines a center of excellence for medical cannabis products and research. It will finally erase the stigma of a plant with medicinal benefits, a true gift of nature.All photos courtesy of Chuck Manansala"

And for Councilor Dra. Geleen “Dok G” Lumbad, the sustainability of her programs is a must to the Quezon City third district youth’s future and educational needs that’s why her team has an ongoing distribution of free shoes and vitamins for boys and girls to all 37 barangays since a week ago. “That’s what we are doing since last week, distributing quality shoes to the daycare, kinder and grade 1 to 6 children. This is an advocacy for me even before and not only in our district, but also to some areas and provinces. We also give vitamins and medicines to the elder people,” Lumbad said. The quality pair of black rubberized shoes with different sizes have already been given to 25,000 boys and girls from different barangays. Lumbad supported by her husband businessman Joseph Lumbad is eyeing to add 10,000 shoes more to distribute to the other barangays and public schools too. The free shoes, vitamins and medicines for boys and girls are coming from Lumbad’s own pocket. “We’ve been giving away free vitamins and medicines for a long time although the distribution of free shoes for schoolers have just started last week to at least 10 public schools, and we are still eyeing to visit more public schools here in our district,” the 30-year-old Lumbad added. “Every kid is entitled of free shoes and vitamins in our district because we believe they are our future, the hope of next generation,” she explained. “We are still willing to give more free bags if needed as well as free vitamins.” She also supports thousands of people including grandparents under her district by supplying them with free medicines and vitamins as part of her weekly programs coming also from her own pocket. The mother of three boys has an upcoming baby girl in the first week of September. But despite being pregnant, Lumbad remains very committed to her council duties in her district, collaborating with fellow councilors to address some issues in their surroundings. Lumbad ran independently last 2022 election and won in the Quezon City third district as the No. 2 city councilor, which consists of six council seats. She is also known to be a big supporter of Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte. “Our Mayor Joy Belmonte has been very supportive and productive to all the districts here in Quezon City, including in our third district, and we are very thankful to her great passion as a public servant and as the mother of our city,” Lumbad said. “Mayor Joy’s hard work is very inspiring to all of us, while our people serve as our motivation to keep going in our duty as elected public servant.”"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/08/29/wb-making-local-vaxx-benefits-phl-but-not-now/,"WB: Making local vaxx benefits PHL, but not now","DESPITE having a young population and a current dependence on imported vaccines, the Philippines would gain from having its own vaccine manufacturing industry. However, it will take more time and investments to make this happen, according to the World Bank.In a Philippine case study for the Asean Vaccine Development and Manufacturing Research Project, the World Bank said the Philippines faces a number of challenges that prevent it from becoming a vaccine manufacturer in the region.One of these primary challenges is that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has yet to achieve Maturity level 3 based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT).“It is also preparing for an upcoming WHO GBT audit by working to address challenges identified during a previous audit. Facility and manpower needs have been identified and the PFDA [Philippine FDA] is working to address them through ongoing capacity-building efforts. Achievement of ML3 status would enable the Philippines to better support and participate in regional vaccine efforts,” the World Bank said.Based on the WHO data, a Regional Regulatory System must attain an overall ML3 to be eligible for listing as a vaccine manufacturer and undergo the Performance Evaluation Framework (PEF).The PEF, according to WHO documents, is designed to promote trust and reliance in regulatory systems in the context of the international supply of medicines and vaccines.The FDA, World Bank said, has received an overall rating of ML1, though some functions received higher scores than others. The national regulatory system, registration and marketing, and clinical trials oversight were rated ML1.In terms of vigilance, licensing establishments, regulatory inspection, and laboratory testing, the FDA was rated ML2 while only the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) lot release function was rated ML3.“The WHO team determined that nine functions have greater than 80 percent implementation, and two have greater than 90 percent. There will be a follow-up assessment in October 2022 followed by a formal assessment scheduled for 2023,” World Bank said.The report also noted that a number of pharmaceutical companies in the Philippines have the potential to manufacture vaccines. However, certain concerns prevent them from doing so.These include their dependence on imported raw materials for vaccine production, as well as the difficult operating environment that leads to high labor costs and concerns about transparency in business transactions.The local pharmaceutical industry also needs policies that support investments such as long-term advance market commitment/guarantee by the Government.The World Bank also noted a need to capacitate human resources with required technical skills for vaccine manufacturing and to build relationships with external partners to support technology transfer.Given these challenges, the World Bank said, the Philippines can benefit from a regional vaccine security ecosystem that allows it to source vaccines from regional manufacturers.This is a feasible arrangement while the country focuses on building its domestic capacity in vaccine delivery and procurement planning to ensure sufficient vaccine supply.“With its large population, a market guarantee or long-term commitment from the Philippines to procure vaccines from a regional source could help to encourage investment in vaccine manufacture in the ASEAN region,” the World Bank said.Image credits: Cai U.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/08/25/poor-pay-poverty-premium-in-phl-aspac-adb-report/,"Poor pay ‘poverty premium’ in PHL, AsPac–ADB report","SMALL purchases, bad roads, and low access to credit are among the factors that make poverty expensive in the Philippines and in other countries in the Asia and the Pacific region, according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB).At the launch of the Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific report on Thursday, ADB Economic Research and Development Impact Department Statistician Arturo Martinez Jr. said the poor pay a poverty premium which makes goods and services about 20 percent more expensive compared to the country average.In the Philippines, poor households have a penchant for buying “tingi” or small quantities which are cheaper, but in the long run turn out to be expensive as they need to buy more to meet their needs. More affluent households, however, have greater financial resources and are able to buy in bulk, which turns out cheaper as this prevents them from buying as frequently as poor households do.“The report alludes to income-constrained people who may prefer buying in small quantities while people with higher incomes have the option to buy in bulk if they desire. In some cases, quantity premiums may be substantial in the long run. This is just one example of how the poverty premium manifests,” Martinez told BusinessMirror in an email.Other examples of poverty premiums have to do with bad roads which make transportation costlier for poor households. Since many poor Filipinos live in areas with poor infrastructure facilities, they must pay more to access economic opportunities or participate in economic activities.Martinez also said poor households do not have many of the conveniences of affluent households such as access to cheap electricity and appliances like refrigerators, which affect the products they consume and their ability to purchase goods in bulk.He said expensive electricity prompts poor households to resort to buying coal, firewood, and other forms of biomass which often are more expensive for them. One example, he said, was kerosene, which other studies found is more expensive for poor people.The limited finances of poor households make them prey to “payday lenders” who often charge exorbitant interest rates, Martinez also said. This eventually exacerbates the dire financial position of these households and sinks them deeper into debt and poverty.“Other examples alluded to in the report include how geographic location may make goods and services more expensive in some areas where there are large pockets of poverty. These inequalities need to be addressed if we are aiming to meet SDG (Sustainable Development Goal) 1 by 2030,” Martinez told this newspaper.Martinez said lower-income households experienced faster inflation over the past decade in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Taipei.In July, the inflation experienced by all households nationwide reached 4.7 percent but for the Bottom 30 percent, inflation was higher at 5.2 percent.Even when inflation peaked at 8.7 percent among all households in January this year, the increase in prices experienced by the poorest Filipinos was higher at 9.7 percent.Based on the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the Bottom 30 percent of households showed they spend more on food as well as electricity, gas and other fuels.The PSA data showed 51.38 percent of Filipinos’ income is spent on food alone while 10.11 percent on electricity, gas and other fuels. This represents the weight of these commodities in the CPI for the Bottom 30 percent.These are also higher than the CPI of all households where food has a weight of 34.78 percent and electricity, gas and other fuels, 6.74 percent.“In addition to reducing poverty, it is also important to amplify the resilience of Filipinos. Bringing poor people to just above the poverty line may not be enough if they can be easily pushed back below it if another crisis hits,” Martinez told reporters.“As alluded to in the Key Indicators report, strengthening socioeconomic resilience through enhanced social protection coverage that goes beyond crisis, and complemented by programs that address systematic inequalities such as investing in infrastructure that help bring socioeconomic opportunities closer to where poor Filipinos are, should be part of policy strategies that aim to reduce poverty,” he added.ADB said poor households may also be forced to live in informal settlements where they are exposed to greater health hazards, increasing their health care costs, and they may have longer and less convenient commutes.MEANWHILE, ADB expressed concern that the increased cost-of-living crisis sparked by surging inflation last year, combined with the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, continues to push people in Asia and the Pacific into extreme poverty.An estimated 155.2 million people in developing Asia and the Pacific, or 3.9 percent of the region’s population, lived in extreme poverty as of last year, according to Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2023, released today.The number is 67.8 million greater than it would have been without the pandemic and the increased cost of living crisis, according to the report. Extreme poverty is defined as living on less than $2.15 a day, based on 2017 prices and adjusted for purchasing power and inflation.Image credits: Cai U.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/08/24/health-insurance-technologies-must-be-sustained-amid-innovations-experts/,"Health, insurance technologies must be sustained amid innovations–experts","HEALTH. Insurance. Technology. Put them all together, and their promise of bringing a positive change to society and significant share to nation-building will rise.Amid various innovations now taking place in both the health and surety industries, technology plays a pivotal role for their continued success and growth in the long run. Hence, it is important that industry leaders, key players and advocates work together to achieve a more inclusive and sustainable healthtech and insurtech sectors for the benefit of Filipinos.Supporting the country’s growing healthtech industry, Metro Pacific Investments Corp.’s mWell serves as a fully integrated and fully digital health and wellness platform in the country.“This is a fully integrated app experience. We’re in that space where we need to digitalize and bridge the digital divide. This app is that. From the time you select a doctor, all the way towards buying your medicine, and delivered straight to your house,” said Metro Pacific Health Tech mWell Chief Marketing and Commercial Officer Gary Dujali during a roundtable discussion organized by Digital Pilipinas, together with the Philippine Insurers and Reinsurers Association (PIRA), the Philippine Life Insurance Association (PLIA), and the Philippine Insurtech and Healthtech Association (PIHAI). In the social protection space, Etiqa Philippines contributes by way of offering innovative technological solutions and its commitment to serve customers well through various digital touchpoints.“We need to be able to provide excellent customer experience. What we have done is even before the pandemic hit, we were already developing our app-based solutions,” noted Rico Bautista, PLIA president and Etiqa Philippines president and chief executive officer (CEO).He underscored the importance of a framework that helps stakeholders understand how an organization is managing risks and opportunities related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria.For him, ESG is something that all must pursue. Bautista explained: “Digitalization and being part of Digital Pilipinas and the healthtech and insurtech associations allow us to push forward that ESG concept and initiative that we all should be having. We want to be at the forefront of this because we are serious about sustainability and ESG.”For his part, PLIA General Manager and Data Protection Officer George Mina delved on the important changes in the insurance industry in the sphere of digitalization.“The most significant is being able to sell life insurance on a digital basis. It used to be a face-to-face thing. If you look at the websites of life insurance companies, they’re getting more and more personalized (in terms of) branding of digital assistance,” he said.Hyper-personalized digital banking solutions provider Inypay Founder and CEO Arivuvel Ramu discussed the insurance onboarding platform and the potential for insurtech growth. “If you look at Insurtech on a global scale, it’s a $83 billion market share as of 2022. By 2028, the prediction for micro-insurance alone is $118 billion global market share. Out of that, if you look at Southeast Asia alone, as of 2022, it’s a $3 billion worth of market and by 2028, the potential market to grow is by $8.4 billion just for the microfinance sector alone,” he cited.DURING the event, findings of the initial research of The Voice of Digital Pilipinas were also revealed. With focus on cybersecurity and data privacy, the study showed that government agencies are the most trusted application platforms in terms of mobile applications. “This serves as an opportunity for the Philippine government. The trust factor is really high, with 3/5 Filipinos preferring government agency applications. This is followed distantly by applications from e-wallets and bank applications,” Tangere CEO Martin Penaflor said.The Voice of Digital Pilipinas, a collaborative initiative by Digital Pilipinas, Global Fintech Institute, and Tangere that seeks to give a democratic voice to Filipinos, will come up with research on different topics including healthtech and insurtech to know the pulse of the Filipinos in various industries.Digital Pilipinas Convenor Amor Maclang emphasized the need to back up local players in these sectors, which are also two of the very important work streams of their organization. “Health and insurance are two very important aspects of our work. We will be having a series of programs for both healthtech and insurtech and grow these industries domestically. We are working on a possible execution of smart contracts and blockchain in the insurance space,” she bared.“There will be a pitch fest and a hackathon because we realize that many of the insurtech players are foreign. We hope to encourage many insurtech founders coming from the Philippines and coming from Asean to join the pitch fest and hackathon and be part of the Digital Pilipinas Festival x Philippine FinTech Festival happening in November,” she said of their upcoming event, which will take place from the 21st to the 24th day of such month at the SMX Aura and in various co-located venues and innovation hubs across the country.To register, please visitImage credits: Roderick L.

It is one of our primordial concerns. This MOU signing with PHAP will take us one step closer to realizing better health for all people living in the city. As the pilot city for this novel partnership, we are very committed to it. Every time we see innovation, we want to be pioneering it,” Magalong said. In his message during the launch of the baseline study results, Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Teodoro J. Herbosa recognized the role of public-private partnerships as well as the leadership of local government units in achieving a Healthy Pilipinas. “In the realm of healthcare, the government recognizes the invaluable role of public-private partnerships in ensuring equitable access to essential medicines. Access to medicines is of paramount importance especially during a crisis. This is not only a matter of health but also a complex and multi-faceted issue. It requires collaboration among governments, international organizations, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, and civil society to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to lead healthy and productive lives,” Herbosa said.“Hence, the current administration’s goal highlighted the need to strengthen the public-private partnerships across all key industry players for sustainable access to medicines and reduce out-of-pocket spending for Filipinos. I would also like to recognize the pivotal role of our local government units in revolutionizing our health systems with a humane and responsive approach. Their leadership is a catalyst for positive change,” he added. The MOU has set off a baseline study on the health needs of Baguio City residents as well as commenced discussions on the details of the project which has two components.The baseline study, conducted in April to May this year, serves as one of the City’s evidence-based resources to determine the general health status, level of medicine access, and health aspirations of residents. About 1,000 households from 111 barangays were part of the said baseline study.The results of the baseline study were presented to the national and local healthcare leaders, and the citizens of Baguio. It was followed by a workshop among members of the City health office and health board to discuss the results of the baseline study, as well as identify healthcare access priorities for the City.Also under the MOU, the first component of the partnership is the consolidation of PHAP Members’ health and medicine access programs. A number of biopharmaceutical companies belonging to PHAP has begun exploratory discussions with Baguio City to demonstrate their commitment to the health of the residents.“Since we started the partnership, we have seen that Baguio City continues to be a leading innovation hub in the country. The goal of this pilot program is to demonstrate that quality healthcare can be achieved by rolling out access to innovative medicines through public-private partnerships. We recognize the leadership of Mayor Magalong in enabling innovation, good governance and collaboration as a strategy to improve health outcomes for Baguio City residents,” PHAP Executive Director Teodoro Padilla said.Meanwhile, the second component under the MOU is composed of the actual ecosystem building for a stronger healthcare system in the city, with support from the greater healthcare community.“As we have seen at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, we need to strengthen our healthcare system and ensure that life-saving medicines and vaccines are available to the people. This is an example of an innovative public-private partnership. We are working together with the private sector to find ways to make healthcare more accessible to everyone living in the City. As we do this, we are continuing our advocacy for good governance beyond politics,” Magalong said."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/08/24/health-experts-call-for-intensified-efforts-to-raise-hpv-awareness-address-misconceptions/,"Health experts call for intensified efforts to raise HPV awareness, address misconceptions","According to health experts, members of the academe, and other health advocates, increasing awareness of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and addressing misconceptions about it among parents is essential to improving vaccine uptake.HPV, a sexually transmitted infection, is the cause of most cervical cancers. Cervical cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women nationwide. Widespread vaccination with the HPV vaccine could help reduce the number of people who develop cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers around the world. This would have a significant impact on public health, as cervical cancer is a major cause of death among women worldwide.“In our fulfillment in the World Health Assembly to address cervical cancer, we are working to increase the coverage of HPV vaccination in the country. For the calendar year 2023, the Department of Health has acquired one million doses of HPV vaccine, which will cover an estimated 500,000 females aged nine to 17, or approximately 38 percent of the nationwide school-aged children target,” said Dr. Jan Llevado, Department of Health (DOH) Cancer Control Division chief, during the recent 12th HPV Summit.The Philippines began its HPV immunization program in 2013 as a demonstration project. In 2015, the DOH expanded the program to cover 20 priority provinces with high poverty rates and incidence of HPV. In the following years, the program was rolled out to more local government units. To date, there are 52 provinces, 64 cities and one municipality where the vaccination program is being implemented.“For those who have access or can afford the vaccine there are parental and patient concerns and misconceptions that affect acceptability and vaccine hesitancy,” said Dr. Erlinda Cuisia-Cruz, Adolescent Medicine Division head, Philippine Children’s Medical Center.Dr. Cuisia-Cruz was one of the speakers during the 12th HPV Summit, themed “One Community Against HPV,” jointly organized by the Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association of the Philippines and MSD in the Philippines in partnership with the DOH, AC Health, Philippine Obstetrical and Gynecological Society, the Society of Adolescent Medicine of the Philippines, and the Cancer Warriors Foundation.“As pedia and adolescent specialists, we have direct access to patients and their parents. We can provide education and information about the benefits of HPV vaccination, its role in the prevention of cancer and other related diseases. We can also address concerns and clarify misconceptions to help them make informed decisions,” added Dr. Cuisia-Cruz.Carmen Auste, Vice President of Cancer Coalition Philippines, mentioned that one of the misconceptions about the HPV vaccine is that it is only for people who are already sexually active.“Some people associate HPV vaccination with sexual activity rather than cervical cancer prevention,” said Auste.Dr. Cuisia-Cruz concurred, adding the need to address concerns about HPV vaccination “as a license to sexual initiation and promiscuity.”“When we give the vaccine we are not saying yes they can have sex. The message is, it is for the prevention of cervical cancer,” she pointed out.Dr. Jeanne Tiangha Gonzales, Assistant Secretary of the National Board Association of Municipal Health Officers of the Philippines, said they can help intensify HPV education and awareness.“When we distribute consent forms, sometimes they decline because they are not aware about HPV so we have to intensify our campaign,” said Dr. Gonzales.She said they will be more persistent in reaching out to mothers or parents through health summits and other activities for both parents and teens so they can learn more about HPV and cervical cancer together.“The child can convince the parent to allow her for vaccination,” said Dr. Gonzales.The need to scale up HPV vaccination was highlighted during the recent 12th HPV Summit. It also underscored that HPV immunization as a preventive measure is integral as the Philippines intensifies its efforts to eliminate cervical cancer. Alongside comprehensive investment in immunization, increasing access to cervical cancer screening and treatment are seen to yield substantial socio-economic returns and elimination of the disease for Philippine society.Nearly all instances of cervical cancer are linked to HPV infection. Cervical cancer is also a preventable and highly treatable disease if detected early. In November 2020, the World Health Organization launched a strategy to eliminate cervical cancer with three pillars: ensuring vaccination for 90 percent of girls, screening 70 percent of women aged 35 to 45, and treating diagnosed women appropriately.In the Philippines, cervical cancer is the fourth primary cause of cancer-related deaths among women, claiming more than 4,000 lives yearly. With around 38 million Filipino women still susceptible to cervical cancer, this equates to an alarming rate of 11 Filipinas losing their lives daily to the disease.This is why the HPV Summit directed its discussion around the importance of a prevention-centric approach and investing more in early prevention by vaccinating young girls so they are protected from HPV infections that can cause cancer later in life.To support this endeavor, the Department of Education (DepEd) will ensure that young girls would know about cervical cancer.“To stand as vanguards of Filipino Children, our future, and through Department Order 173 or the inclusion of human papillomavirus vaccination in our school-based immunization program, DepEd has shown our commitment to the cause. As we have returned to face-to-face classes post-pandemic, we are in an even more opportune position to make this more pronounced and build on our efforts, both in terms of our comprehensive sexuality education program and our adolescent reproductive health program through our teen centers. We seek to work with all of you to make cancer control and school health more deeply embedded in the lives of our young learners,” said Dr. Dexter Galban, DepEd Assistant Secretary for Operations.In this crucial moment, a strong appeal is being made for individuals, groups, and communities to unite in the collective fight against HPV.

(PPFI), has been recognized as the winner in the 2023 League of Corporate Foundations (LCF) CSR Guild Awards for Outstanding Project in Health.The Guild Awards is an annual recognition of outstanding corporate social responsibility programs, collaborations, and other initiatives that have achieved sustainable impact upon the communities and institutions served. The entries were screened by a panel of external judges, and the top prizes were acknowledged and collectively decided on by member organizations of LCF.“It is our honor to be recognized for our efforts in helping people from marginalized communities,” said Ken Millan, digital lead for Pfizer Philippines who has likewise led the inception of the program. “We advocate making health accessible to all and strive to find innovative solutions for health barriers that many Filipinos encounter.”The medical drone project is a pilot program aiming to ease the logistical health challenges posed by the geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDAs) in the Philippines. These areas generally have poor health outcomes due to the lack of accessible health facilities and health professionals.For this project, PPFI selected Barangay Binicalan in the municipality of San Luis, Agusan del Sur as the implementation site. The area consists of mostly forestland, and the roads are impassable especially during the rainy season. The initial objective was to determine the feasibility of medical cargo and drone delivery in GIDAs.It took extensive planning in partnership with WeRobotics and Philippine Flying Labs and coordination with the Provincial Health Office of Agusan del Sur. The flight testing occurred on March 6-10, 2022, completing 12 flights at only 10 minutes travel time—much faster than land travel which would normally take two hours using a habal-habal (a provincial motorcycle taxi).The medical cargo included water samples, essential medicines, and vials of the COVID-19 vaccine, which were received by the community health workers from the Agusan del Sur Provincial Health Office. They also administered the COVID-19 vaccines on the same day. Additionally, WeRobotics also provided a cold chain solution for the safe transportation of vaccines and other medicines that have temperature requirements.The team concluded that the medical cargo and drone delivery was an efficient way to deliver essential medicines to the community. There was also a timely identification of water contamination during the flight testing, allowing an early intervention on water-borne diseases.“Knowing the feasibility and potential impact of the project, we are keen to continue extending medical support to these far-flung areas and improve their health access,” said Geoffrey Garcia, executive director of PPFI.Pfizer Philippines continues to work closely with the Philippine Government, NGOs and patient organizations, media and the academe, in launching dynamic health programs and partnerships to promote health access and strengthen health outcomes nationwide."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/27/nestle-launches-familywellness-festival-in-quezon-city-to-celebrate-nutrition-month/,Nestlé launches FamilyWellness Festival in Quezon City to celebrate Nutrition Month,"MARKING the Nutrition Month this July, Nestlé Philippines Inc. debuted its Family Wellness Festival aimed at educating Filipino households about good nutrition to achieve a healthier, happier life.As a headstart, the food and beverage (F&B) giant partnered with the local government unit (LGU) of Quezon City for the festivity’s launch attended by around 4,000 local residents and those from nearby cities who pre-registered online at .“We at Nestlé Philippines believe that good nutrition starts at home. We are bringing the Family Wellness Festival closer to communities as we strive to provide citizens with the right information and tips that can help them improve their health and wellness,” Nestlé Philippines Senior Vice President and Head of Corporate Affairs Joey Uy III said during the kick off ceremony held at the Quezon Memorial Circle in Quezon City last July 15.This initiative complements the ongoing nutrition programs of Quezon City led by Mayor Joy Belmonte.“We strive to provide our QCitizens all the support they need to have a healthy mind and body to make them productive, free from ailments and able to live longer. It’s the right of every citizen to have a good health. But the local government cannot do it alone. We need the support of the private sector to augment our efforts,” she emphasized.PIVOTAL to health and development, nutrition is the process of taking food of living organisms and converting it into energy and other important nutrients so as to grow, maintain themselves, and reproduce. Unfortunately in the Philippines, Filipinos have been constantly confronted by nutritional issues since time immemorial, according to experts who graced the event.They continue to carry the triple burden of malnutrition—under-nutrition among kids, over-nutrition or obesity for adults, and micronutrient deficiency, Nestlé Philippines nutrition advocacy executive Edelwise “Ivy” Sicat told reporters on the sidelines of the event. Such conditions are shown in the typical Pinggang Pinoy. She said: “It’s our go, grow, glow plate-based guide for Filipinos on the proper amounts and kinds of food we eat per meal.”Citing the study of the Department of Science and Technology-Food and Nutrition Research Institute (DOST-FNRI), she described the Pinggang Pinoy as half full of rice and the other half would have a little fish and some vegetables. “If you have so much rice, your meal is not balanced and if you continue with this diet for a long time, you will have a problem,” Sicat pointed out. “[Or when] you’re just eating a cup of rice, but your viand is very high in fat and you’re not eating any vegetable, that’s certainly not a good combination [too].”Apart from economic and inflationary pressures, what’s contributing to the nutritional deficiency of Filipinos today is the shortage of supply.“Food insecurity is a problem, Filipinos have no access to food,” underscored DOST-FNRI Senior Science Research Specialist Ruby J. Frane. “[So] we use data from our research to draft policy recommendations. We’re focusing on the deficiencies in our diet, like there’s a high deficiency of vitamin A in infants, its natural sources coming mostly from yellow foods, vegetables, and milk.”TRUE to this year’s Nutrition Month theme, “Healthy diet gawing affordable for all,” Nestlé Philippines keeps its promise to make good nutrition accessible with nutrient-packed and budget-friendly F&B products that are enriched with essential vitamins and minerals for each family member.“Nestlé is working on that so we’ve fortified our products with the key nutrients that are deficient in the Filipino diet, such as vitamins A and C, zinc, calcium, iron. We’ve also reduced some of the sensitive ingredients, like sugar, fat, salt, in Nestlé products,” Sicat explained in reference to some of their well-loved brands such as Milo, Bear Brand, Maggi, Chuckie, Koko Krunch, Nescafe, Nestea and Boost.“We’re locally sourcing some of our ingredients to reduce the cost. We also have different SKUs [stock keeping units] to cater to different families’ buying capacities. But when we say affordable, it should also be sulit [value for money]. That means consumers are getting a product that’s affordable, nutritious and delicious, and contains all the nutrients they need,” she added.THE initial staging of the Family Wellness Festival was both insightful and enjoyable for attendees.Invited experts shared health and wellness learnings and tips that they can apply and practice at home. For instance, the Department of Agriculture gave pointers on how to start a vegetable garden based on its Food Always in the Home or FAITH program. This was followed by a cooking demonstration to promote “sarap-sustansya” meals for the family. Registered nutritionists-dietitians were available to give free personalized nutrition consultations to participants.Festivalgoers joined the fun games and exciting activities, courtesy of different Nestlé brands. Aside from promos and discounts, its products and special prizes were raffled off throughout the day. They also received freebies by exchanging empty sachets and tetra packs of products manufactured by the multinational. This is in line with the company’s 3Rs advocacy to engage more Filipinos to “Reuse, Reduce and Recycle” plastic wastes and become part of the movement for environmental sustainability.Making the event “greener”, a representative from nonprofit organization Pure Oceans gave a talk, together with a representative from GMA Sparkle, about environment protection and its positive impact in the wellness of the planet. As the Kasambuhay for Good and family wellness partner of Filipinos, Nestlé Philippines will bring the Family Wellness Festival to Makati City and Caloocan City in August.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/27/the-medical-city-answers-the-global-call-for-creating-a-greener-space-for-all/,The Medical City answers the global call for creating a greener space for all,"More and more Filipino families consider themselves “food poor,” or unable to meet their basic food needs and get enough healthy food options. In the self-rated survey of Social Weather Stations, 39 percent of Filipino families considered themselves food poor in the first quarter of the year, showing a five-percent increase from last year’s results. The age-old problems of hunger, malnutrition, and food crises have continually hunted us and remain a growing concern to this day.Among the most promising solutions that can increase food sources and hopefully address the food crisis is urban Gardening.In one of the busiest streets in the Metro, a modernized city full of concrete and sky-high buildings sprouts a solution to the threatening food problems. Hand in hand with the Pasig City Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO), The Medical City actively forges its commitment to the green revolution by supporting the green initiative and creating green spaces for all.In the middle of the health crisis, where the world continues to adapt to life with Covid-19, The Medical City found an opportunity to start its small urban gardening project. In the form of a contest organized by Nutrition Management Services (a multidisciplinary team of nutrition specialists in The Medical City), employees were encouraged to join the green initiative.To coincide with the country’s annual Nutrition Month celebration last July 2022, green growers planted lettuce, cabbage, and spinach in solidarity. The seeds were placed in seedling trays before being transferred to urban containers to allow them to grow.Joselle Teofisto, a dedicated Administrative Associate of The Medical City during office hours and a committed urban gardener during her break time, shares how she took care of her bok choy and lettuce. “I started with a seedling tray and then every day I would look into it during lunch break. When I see that some of its parts had turned yellow, that is my cue to remove it so that my efforts would not go to waste,” Teofisto said.A new green grower, John Carlo Gatapia, shows that one does not need to be a horticulturist to be an urban gardener. The noob planter also shares that he is excited about the outcomes of his labor, especially now that he is learning something new. “This is the first time I am growing anything. I am excited to learn to grow these greens and apply them at home,” Catapia said.From less than ten participants in 2022 when it first started, the membership continues to grow, with almost 30 entries from different departments now joining the Urban Gardening Contest in its second year. In early 2023, green growers were blessed with a bunch of fresh produce, which they sold to The Medical City community.This year’s celebration of Nutrition Month was made even more purposeful as the green thumb winners unanimously agreed to donate their monetary prizes to Akbay Ginahawa Foundation, Inc., an independent non-profit organization providing financial and material support to indigent patients of The Medical City. Akbay Ginahawa Director Rafael S. Claudio humbly accepted the donation and immediately thanked the winners, saying the proceeds will go a long way in helping more people achieve quality healthcare.Pasig City Councilor Paul Romano Santiago, one of the key speakers of The Medical City Nutrition Month Celebration, congratulated the organization for their green initiatives and mentioned his continued support. He also visited the Urban Gardening spaces located on the rooftop of the hospital.With the successes of the Urban Gardening Project, Nutrition Management Services plans to plant more as they continue the activity all year round. To further promote sustainable, healthy eating habits, the unit also provides nutrition consultations and personalized meal plans for inpatients and outpatients of all age segments. To know more about their programs, visit The Medical City Ortigas or contact Nutrition Management Services at 8988-1000 or 7000 loc. 6510 or 09155410095."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/27/pilipinas-shell-foundation-passes-nutrition-program-on-lgus/,Pilipinas Shell Foundation passes nutrition program on LGUs,"PILIPINAS Shell Foundation, Inc. (PSFI), the corporate social responsibility (CSR) unit of Shell Pilipinas Corp. (SPC), celebrated the successful culmination of its Roots to Shoots (RTS) program and transferred its stewardship to the local government units (LGUs) of Bombon and Pasacao in Camarines Sur to ensure its continuity in the long run.RTS is aimed at addressing the issue of malnutrition, especially in far-flung areas where access to government’s health initiatives and nutritious food is lacking.PSFI Chairman Cesar A. Buenaventura underscored the importance of agriculture and food security for SPC. He said: “Our training farm has benefitted many farmers. Together you’ve successfully reduced malnutrition and improved sanitation and health—with very tangible results.”The program, according to PSFI Senior Program Manager, Nutrition and Food Security Maria Pamela S. Castro, “was designed with a holistic approach, recognizing the need to improve nutrition and well-being in a comprehensive manner.” She also noted that its components “reflect our deep understanding of the complex challenges and the implementation of multifaceted solutions.”BY and large, the young populace of Camarines Sur has the highest prevalence of impaired growth and development due to poor nutrition in the Bicol region. One in five, or 20 percent of children below five years old in the municipalities of Bombon and Pasacao are stunted, meaning they are too short for their age.With the RTS program, however, the slim chance of addressing this problem has grown in the past recent years. In fact, the pilot project’s Mother and Child Care component has mitigated over the course of three years stunting among the kids in both towns, from 32.90 percent to 25.45 percent and 31.90 percent to 21.33 percent, respectively. Its Food Security and Livelihood element, on the other hand, has achieved significant milestones, including increased availability of food and economic access for mothers, caregivers and farmers. Communities have also gained from improved food production, as farmer groups have generated employment opportunities in both in-farm and off-farm enterprises.Meanwhile, the Water Access, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) part has increased access to WASH services in target communities by constructing water systems and sanitation facilities, as well as training residents on proper hygiene and sanitation.Likewise, it reinforced local utility firm Bombon Water District by enhancing water system infrastructure and improving the technical capacities of its personnel.“We learned that when it comes to solving malnutrition, water access, sanitation, and hygiene play a critical role,” Manila Water Foundation (MWF) Executive Director Reginald M. Andal said in mixed Filipino and English.Such positive results indicate the program’s effectiveness in promoting sustainable development.“It is a good model that can be replicated in other places. It’s really a powerhouse; our community volunteers were excited telling their stories, and I’m really looking forward that this excitement will be sustained even beyond the life of the project,” World Vision Development Foundation (WVDF) National Director Rommel V. Fuerte pointed out.FOR longevity of RTS, a handover ceremony was held with the participation of representatives from PSFI and its partners MWF, WVDF, LGUs, and community members—all pledging their collaborative works to ensure the initiative’s transition into its sustainability phase.“We have joined forces with governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), academic institutions, and local communities because we recognize that collective action and shared responsibility are essential for sustainable development. Together, we have harnessed diverse expertise, pooled resources, and embraced different perspectives to create more comprehensive and impactful solutions,” said PSFI Senior Technical Program Manager Raiza V. Cusi.“As we turn this program to the community, we wish you all the best in continuing what we have been able to start,” Buenaventura added.In honor of their valuable contribution and support to this initiative of the CSR arm of SPC, the LGUs and barangays that back it up were feted with plaques of appreciation. Also, the exceptional barangay nutrition scholars were recognized during the event. This was followed by the signing of a deed of donation between the program implementers and the LGUs, cementing their commitment to its sustainability. Efforts are underway to bring it to more provinces that need nutritional support, with the addition of more partners.PSFI has been involved in various community programs, collaborating with prominent initiatives, such as the National Nutrition Council’s Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition and Scaling Up Nutrition global movement.Roderick L.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/27/climate-change-leads-to-growing-risk-of-mosquito-borne-viral-diseases-eu-agency/,Climate change leads to growing risk of mosquito-borne viral diseases–EU agency,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP)—European Union officials warned last week that there is a growing risk of mosquito-borne viral diseases such as dengue and chikungunya in Europe due to climate change.The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control said that because Europe is experiencing a warming trend, with heat waves and flooding becoming more frequent and severe, and summers getting longer and warmer, the conditions are more favorable for invasive mosquito species such as Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti.The Stockholm-based agency said in a report that Aedes albopictus is a known vector of chikungunya and dengue viruses and has been establishing itself farther north and west in Europe. The other mosquito, Aedes aegypti, known to transmit dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, zika and West Nile viruses, has been established in Cyprus since 2022 and may spread to other European countries.A decade ago, the Aedes albopictus mosquito was established in eight European countries, with 114 regions affected. This year, the mosquito is established in 13 countries and 337 regions, the ECDC said.“If this continues, we can expect to see more cases and possibly deaths from diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile fever,” ECDC director Andrea Ammon said. “Efforts need to focus on ways to control mosquito populations, enhancing surveillance and enforcing personal protective measures.”Before, the diseases were imported from abroad, but ”now we have domestically acquired cases,” Ammon said in an online news conference.The agency said ways to control mosquito populations include eliminating standing water where mosquitoes breed, using eco-friendly larvicides and promoting community awareness about mosquito control. To protect themselves, people can use mosquito bed nets, sleep or rest in screened or air-conditioned rooms, wear clothes that cover most of the body and use mosquito repellent, the ECDC said.It said that raising awareness about diseases transmitted by mosquitoes is essential.There is no specific treatment for dengue. While about 80 percent of infections are mild, severe cases can lead to internal bleeding, organ damage and death.Chikungunya fever, a debilitating disease that is suspected of afflicting tens of thousands, was first identified in Africa in 1953. It causes severe pain in the joints but is rarely fatal. There is no vaccine and it is mainly treated with pain medication.Ammon said 1,339 locally acquired cases of West Nile infections, including 104 deaths, were reported in Europe in 2022, the highest number since an epidemic in 2018.West Nile fever symptoms can include headache, fever, muscle and joint aches, nausea and fatigue. People with West Nile fever typically recover on their own, although symptoms may last for weeks to months."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/27/asian-hospitals-asian-cancer-institute-celebrates8-years-of-supporting-lives-conquering-cancer/,"Asian Hospital’s Asian Cancer Institute celebrates 8 years of supporting lives, conquering cancer","The Asian Cancer Institute (ACI) of Asian Hospital and Medical Center recently celebrated its 8th anniversary with the theme “We Hope and We Heal.”According to Dr. Beaver Tamesis, Asian Hospital President and CEO, the number of cancer cases have been increasing yearly. As such, it is important that Asian Hospital continues to do its job to offer the best cancer management and patient care services.“At Asian Hospital, we offer holistic and integrative care to our cancer patients. We have the best treatments available and we will soon be offering more treatment options. We have to remind ourselves that we have a long battle ahead. United we stand, we will be able to fight this disease,” Dr. Tamesis said.The Department of Health (DOH) apparently agreed with Dr. Tamesis’ statement that Asian Hospital had the best treatments available for cancer. This is because the ACI has been officially accredited by the DOH as a Cancer Specialty Center in a General Hospital.“This recognition further solidifies our commitment to providing exceptional comprehensive care to our patients,” said Dr. Corazon Ngelangel, ACI Director.In her remarks during the anniversary celebration program, Dr. Ngelangel, disclosed that the hospital now offers liquid biopsy in addition to tissue biopsy. Liquid biopsy is an innovative test that is done on a sample of blood, urine, or body fluid to look for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), reflecting the presence of the cancer, even in the absence of discernable gross tumor. Liquid biopsy can also detect molecular aberrations in the presence of and linked to cancer (e.g., EGFRmu).“We will have this July patient support partnerships with AstraZeneca and MSD for patients with lung cancer (EGFR) and various cancers (PD-L1) respectively. We now have a team-based program for bone metastasis, led by Asian’s orthopedic oncologist Dr Samuel Grosman. The ACI is ready to meet the needs of all cancer patients,” she added.Probably the highlight of the celebration was the testimonial of 13-year-old Fey Navarro. Fey was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin: Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma in December 2022. She had been from one hospital to another that her neck nodes began to obstruct her swallowing and breathing, unable to move her neck.“We failed to get a surgery schedule at the Philippine General Hospital so Mama decided to look for a pediatric hematologist oncologist at Asian Hospital and going through the picture roster of doctors, she decided to consult Dr. Michelle Rodriguez who, according to Mama, looked like an angel,” Fey related.When the clinic of Dr. Rodriguez said she was available for a consult, Fey and her mother quickly went to the doctor’s clinic. Dr. Rodriguez provided the mother and daughter the details that they needed and the options that they could choose from.They decided that Fey would be confined for the work ups necessary for the biopsy surgery to push through. When the diagnosis was announced, Fey’s family admitted that they could not shoulder the cost of the treatments that were needed.This was when Dr. Rodriguez referred the family to Asian Charities where they agreed to help the family with the treatment costs and with drugs from the DOH Childhood Cancer Medicine Access Program. She had just ended her chemotherapy sessions when the Asian Cancer Institute celebrated its anniversary.“I would like to thank Dr. Michelle Rodriguez who never gave up on me even though we did not have anything. She is truly heaven sent to us because she was the one who referred us to Asian Charities. Without her remarkable abilities to sustain my health during the chemotherapy, I may still be in another institution, not knowing if I would, and could have survived,” she said.The ACI anniversary kick-off ceremony ended with remarks from Dr. Jose M. Acuin, Asian Hospital’s Chief Medical Officer, who thanked the ACI team for always doing what is best for the patients.“This has been a brave and inspiring morning and I would like to thank the patients and their families for showing us how to live well,” he said.Meanwhile, the ACI will continue with the “Hair Donation Activity for Cancer Patients” even beyond the month of July. Donors must have at least 12 inches of hair in length in order to make donation. The hair should be clean and dry without any styling products like hair spray or mask.Donors should place the pre-cut hair bundle inside a sealed plastic bag and should be labeled with complete name and contact details of the donor. The sealed plastic bag can then be brought to the Asian Hospital Upper Ground Floor, Tower 2."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/27/soda-sweetener-aspartame-now-listed-as-possible-cancer-cause-but-still-considered-safe/,Soda sweetener aspartame now listed as possible cancer cause but still considered safe,"The World Health Organization’s cancer agency has deemed the sweetener aspartame, found in diet soda and countless other foods, as a “possible” cause of cancer, while a separate expert group looking at the same evidence said it still considers the sugar substitute safe in limited quantities.The differing results of the coordinated reviews were released last week. One came from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a special branch of the WHO. The other report was from an expert panel selected by WHO and another U.N. group, the Food and Agriculture Organization.The Lyon, France-based cancer agency periodically reviews potential cancer hazards, but does not determine how likely they are to cause cancer in their evaluations which range from “possibly” carcinogenic to “probably” to cancer-causing.Aspartame joins a category with more than 300 other possible cancer-causing agents, including things like aloe vera extract, Asian-style pickled vegetables and carpentry work.The guidance on use of the sweetener, though, isn’t changing.“We’re not advising consumers to stop consuming [aspartame] altogether,” said WHO’s nutrition director Dr. Francesco Branca. “We’re just advising a bit of moderation.”Aspartame is a low-calorie artificial sweetener that is about 200 times sweeter than sugar. It is a white, odorless powder and the world’s most widely used artificial sweetener.Aspartame is authorized as a food additive in Europe and the US and is used in numerous foods, drinks such as Diet Coke, desserts, chewing gum, medications including cough drops and foods intended to help with weight loss. It’s in tabletop sweeteners sold as Equal, Sugar Twin and NutraSweet.Aspartame was approved in 1974 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration with an acceptable daily intake of 50 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. According to the FDA, a person weighing 132 pounds (60 kilograms) would need to consume about 75 aspartame packets to UN experts evaluated the safety of aspartame in 1981 and set the safe daily limit slightly lower, at 40 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram.David Spiegelhalter, an emeritus statistics professor at Cambridge University, said the guidance means that “average people are safe to drink up to 14 cans of diet drink a day…and even this ‘acceptable daily limit’ has a large built-in safety factor.”WHO’s cancer agency, IARC, convened its expert group in June to assess the potential of aspartame to cause cancer. It based its conclusion that aspartame is “possibly carcinogenic” on studies in humans and animals that found “limited” evidence that the compound may be linked to liver cancer.In a separate evaluation, experts assembled by WHO and the food agency updated their risk assessment, including reviewing the acceptable daily intake. They concluded there was “no convincing evidence” at the currently consumed levels that aspartame is dangerous; their guidelines regarding acceptable levels of consumption were unchanged.The move comes weeks after the WHO said that non-sugar sweeteners and could lead to increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and early death in adults.Not as long as you don’t exceed the guidelines. The FDA said scientific evidence continues to support the agency’s conclusion that aspartame is “safe for the general population,” when used within limits.Almost any substance can be dangerous in excessive amounts, said David Klurfeld, a nutrition expert at the Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington.“The dose makes the poison,” said Klurfeld, who previously served on an IARC panel. “Even essential nutrients like vitamin A, iron and water will kill you within hours if too much is consumed.”WHO’s Branca said it was acceptable for people to consume a “pretty large” amount of aspartame without suffering any ill effects. “High consumers” might want to cut back, he said.Dr. Peter Lurie, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which previously nominated aspartame for IARC review, said there’s an easy choice for consumers.“At least when it comes to beverages, our message is your best choice is to drink water or an unsweetened beverage,” he said.Most people, though, probably don’t pay much attention to IARC evaluations. The agency has previously classified processed meat like hot dogs and bacon as cancer-causing, noting in particular its link to colon cancer. That move surprised even others in the scientific community — the U.K.’s biggest cancer charity reassured Britons that eating a bacon sandwich every so often wouldn’t do them much harm.Food and beverage producers say there’s no reason to avoid products with aspartame.“There is a broad consensus in the scientific and regulatory community that aspartame is safe,” the American Beverage Association said in a statement.WHO’s Branca said the agency advises food manufacturers in general to “use ingredients that do not require the addition of too much sugar.” After the latest assessments of aspartame, Branca said that using sweeteners “is probably not the way forward.” Image credits:"

In a recent collaboration, Watsons joined forces with Operation Smile Philippines (OSP) to conduct a medical mission in Cauayan, Isabela – marking their second initiative of the year.The mission not only paved the way for giving back smiles to 60 beneficiaries, all children with cleft palate condition but also a more meaningful experience for the Watsons employees who volunteered and took part in this endeavor.A total of 35 Watsons employees left their official tasks momentarily and joined the Isabela OSP mission. Truly, it was one extraordinary experience that left a lasting impression on everyone. Pharmacy Manager Ellyrose Simplina of Watsons Isabela talks about her experience of being a part of the mission, “As a volunteer for OSP Mission, it is very rewarding. Especially when we see the smiles of the patients and the parents after a successful operation gives happiness to our hearts and gives us a sense of purpose. Indeed you can find happiness by helping others,” The mission also helped in making the team effort best work together and how they can be hands-on in taking care of the beneficiaries. The volunteers helped in different aspects such as doing the final screening of the patients, interviewing parents, filling up the patient records,, and even post-operative hygiene care to assist the patients properly and make the process easier. “My experience as a volunteer of the OSP mission taught me empathy, compassion, and teamwork. Working with people whom you have never met before can be intimidating at times but it helped me strengthen my communication skills and to see the smile of each patient makes it valuable and rewarding,” Pharmacist Sabrina Faye Reyes shares of her Isabela mission experience.“We are delighted to witness the profound impact of our partnership with Operation Smile Philippines. Through this collaboration, we are not only transforming lives but also reaffirming our commitment to employee volunteerism and making a positive difference in the communities we serve.”, said Sharon Decapia, Marketing AVP of Watsons Philippines. Watsons takes great pride in sharing this humbling and inspiring experience with its entire team. This partnership in the Philippines exemplifies A.S. Watson’s global commitment to bringing 10,000 perfect smiles in collaboration with Operation Smile. With two successful medical missions completed this year, Watsons has plans to organize an additional medical mission in the coming months, with a mission in Tacloban already scheduled."

Hepatitis is a huge public health concern in the Philippines, it said, “but due to lack of awareness, many of those who have this viral disease may not even know they have it until it’s too late.”THE WHO said that Hepatitis, which is caused by a virus that has no symptoms, is a silent killer. It quietly damages the liver for decades before ending in liver cancer and cirrhosis (scarring of the liver that reduces its ability to detoxify blood), says the agency. Deaths due to hepatitis have increased over the past two decades, with 1.4 million lives lost every year. But many leaders and members of the public are still not well-informed about the disease.Dr. Jose Sollano, Jr., a Professor of Medicine at the University of Sto. Tomas (UST) Faculty of Medicine and Surgery and Hepatology Section Chief at the UST Hospital, said that at present, the treatment modality for both hepatitis B and C are in the oral kind. He said there has been success in the cure of hepatitis C which, unfortunately, is not available for Hepatitis B yet.He suggests that for people over 60 years of age and experiencing bone disease due to heavy use of steroids, and those with kidney issues, their medication for hepatitis B treatment be shifted to TDF or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or entecavir (ETV).“Most of these drugs today are very inexpensive we hope today’s patients can be convinced to shift to these safer medications,” explains Dr. Sollano during the Philippines College of Physicians Health Forum held recently.He said the Philippines is in the midst of a high density of people infected with hepatitis, yet the uptake on anti-viral therapy is quite low. “We need to increase awareness that people should seek treatment and consult with physicians so that they can identify patients who need treatment.”DR. Sollano noted that one of the biggest issues with regard to hepatitis treatment is antiviral resistance, which became an issue in the 2020s and beyond globally despite the wide availability of ETV and TDF. He noted that there were earlier treatments like lamivudine, telbivudine and adefovir, which were all implicated in antiviral resistance and its use were all discouraged.“What we found disturbing is that there are still family medicine physicians who are still treating their patients with lamivudine. We reiterate the continuity of the campaign among physicians on the proper use of the correct medication for patients with hepatitis B because the lack of awareness in the use of low-barrier antiviral drugs contribute to our very bad success rates in the control of hepatitis B in the region,” he continued.The message here, Dr. Sollano said, is to switch to high barrier resistance drugs, which he said is the best way moving forward.FOR patients who are obese and suffering from Diabetes Mellitus (DM), DM alone, even if they don’t have hepatitis B, is already an independent risk factor for the development of liver cancer.“What I’m emphasizing is that for patients with hepatitis B and metabolic syndrome, there is really a need to institute a good strategy to avoid further harm on the patient. There’s a need to control diabetes, obesity, make sure they are not drinking alcohol or taking any drugs that will negatively impact further on their liver. Harm reduction is the key,” he concluded.Image credits:"

Most e-liquid formulations deliver nicotine, which has been established as having negative health effects as well as strong addictive properties. The products may also contain other substances, most commonly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive element of cannabis, as well as methamphetamine, methadone or vitamins. The liquids also include humectants (hygroscopic carriers such as propylene glycol and vegetable glycerol) that act as solvents and create a water aerosol or vapor, flavoring agents, cooling agents such as menthol and sweeteners, in addition to metals from the heating coil and other chemicals.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/20/early-breast-cancer-diagnosis-is-key-to-reducing-government-expenses-expert/,Early breast cancer diagnosis is key to reducing government expenses—expert,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide and a similar trend is observed in the Philippines.According to the Philippine Cancer Society (PCS), about 70 percent of breast cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage and only 30 percent in its early stages. For treatment to be highly effective, it is important to detect the disease at an early stage.To provide a platform for discussion on breast cancer, the Swiss Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines (SwissCham Philippines) organized a roundtable series called “Inspiring Conversations on Breast Cancer in the Philippines.” The initiative was led by the PCS and ICanServe Foundation and supported by Novartis Healthcare Philippines. The first of the roundtable series was held on July 12, 2023 at the Manila Peninsula Hotel in Makati City.The speakers included Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire; PCS President Dr. Corazon Ngelangel; Dr. Ann Meredith Garcia-Trinidad, head, Section of Medical Oncology, Dagupan Doctors Villaflor Memorial Hospital; Dr. Maria Cecilia Pagdanganan, head, Breast Center, St. Luke’s Medical Center (SLMC), Quezon City; Dr. Maria Belle Francia, head, Cancer Institute, SLMC- BGC; Adora Perez, Vice President, Corridor of Hope, and Joel Chong, Country President, Novartis Healthcare Philippines.Dr. Ngelangel tackled the breast cancer patient journey, specifically the stages they go through that correspond to the different medical processes. These are diagnosis/unmasking stage, surgery/cleaning out the cancer, chemotherapy/loss of identity, radiotherapy/transition to normality, follow-up care/the “new” day-to-day, relapse/starting over, and metastatic/time-limited chronic breast cancer.Dr. Trinidad shared patient stories on their survivorship journey while Dr. Pagdanganan and Dr. Francia discussed “Breast cancer journey in SLMC from a surgeon’s perspective” and “Patient journey and pain points in advanced breast cancer care” respectively.The discussion likewise touched on the targets of the World Health Organization’s Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI). Established in 2021, the GBCI brings together stakeholders from around the world and across sectors “with the shared goal of reducing breast cancer by 2.5 percent per year, which over a 20-year period would save 2.5 million lives.”The GBCI employs three key strategies to achieve these objectives namely health promotion and early detection, timely diagnosis, and comprehensive breast cancer management.The speakers were each asked this question: If resources were not an issue, what is the one barrier or gap that we can address together, and that will help strengthen the healthcare system and achieve the GBCI targets?For Dr. Ngelangel, it is an organized breast cancer screening program.“If we don’t do this we will keep on getting 70 percent advanced stages of breast cancer and only 30 percent early stage diagnosis. Economic wise, expenditure for late-stage breast cancer is very, very high,” said Dr. Ngelangel.She explained that if we are able to reverse this which means getting 30 percent advanced breast cancer diagnosis and 70 percent early-stage diagnosis, the government can reduce its expenses. Early diagnosis means that it is easier to treat and there is a better chance of a cure.Dr. Francia echoed this adding that having an organized screening is one way to diagnose breast cancer early.“With early-stage breast cancer the chance of cure is higher and the patient can go back to the community and become productive again. When we say organized screening, if the patient comes in and we find something that should be evaluated, we must follow through. If we are able to go through screening up to diagnosis to cure, that would be very ideal,” added Dr. Francia.On the other hand, Vergeire, Drs. Trinidad and Pagdangan said health literacy is something critical especially when it comes to addressing misinformation about health issues.“I believe that health literacy is one important component of seeking care. We know that there is a scarcity of correct information out there and there is so much misinformation that our patients get confused with. It would be good to include health literacy into the school curricula as well as for all healthcare professionals to educate patients, give them the correct information, or lead them to the correct resources and teach them how to identify and address misinformation,” said Dr. Trinidad.The roundtable discussion highlighted the need for a coordinated effort to address breast cancer among Filipinos.“This is something we need to do, and we need to do it together. I will always tell people that the national government alone cannot overcome or address all of these gaps in our healthcare system. But during the time that the pandemic was happening, we saw the Filipino spirit. We saw that every sector worked together. Now, I hope that all of our voices are heard as one, and we unify all of our efforts so that we can give more hope to our breast cancer patients,” said Vergeire."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/17/demystifying-aging-insights-into-the-diverse-pathways-of-aging-and-the-quest-for-effective-anti-aging-interventions/,DEMYSTIFYING AGING: Insights into the diverse pathways of aging and the quest for effective anti-aging interventions,"You likely know someone who seems to age slowly, appearing years younger than their birth date suggests. And you likely have seen the opposite—someone whose body and mind seem much more ravaged by time than others. Why do some people seem to glide through their golden years and others physiologically struggle in midlife?I have worked in the field of aging for all of my scientific career, and I teach the cellular and molecular biology of aging at the University of Michigan. Aging research doesn’t tend to be about finding the one cure that fixes all that may ail you in old age. Instead, the last decade or two of work points to aging as a multi-factoral process—and no single intervention can stop it all.There are many different definitions of aging, but scientists generally agree upon some common features: Aging is a time-dependent process that results in increased vulnerability to disease, injury and death. This process is both intrinsic, when your own body causes new problems, and extrinsic, when environmental insults damage your tissues.Your body is comprised of trillions of cells, and each one is not only responsible for one or more functions specific to the tissue it resides in, but must also do all the work of keeping itself alive. This includes metabolizing nutrients, getting rid of waste, exchanging signals with other cells and adapting to stress.The trouble is that every single process and component in each of your cells can be interrupted or damaged. So your cells spend a lot of energy each day preventing, recognizing and fixing those problems.Aging can be thought of as a gradual loss of the ability to maintain homeostasis—a state of balance among body systems—either by not being able to prevent or recognize damage and poor function, or by not adequately or rapidly fixing problems as they occur. Aging results from a combination of these issues. Decades of research has shown that nearly every cellular process becomes more impaired with age.Most research on cellular aging focuses on studying how DNA and proteins change with age. Scientists are also beginning to address the potential roles many other important biomolecules in the cell play in aging as well.One of the cell’s chief jobs is to maintain its DNA—the instruction manual a cell’s machinery reads to produce specific proteins. DNA maintenance involves protecting against, and accurately repairing, damage to genetic material and the molecules binding to it.Proteins are the workers of the cell. They perform chemical reactions, provide structural support, send and receive messages, hold and release energy, and much more. If the protein is damaged, the cell uses mechanisms involvingspecial proteins that either attempt to fix the broken protein or send it off for recycling. Similar mechanisms tuck proteins out of the way or destroy them when they are no longer needed. That way, its components can be used later to build a new protein.The cross-talk between the components inside cells, cells as a whole, organs and the environment is a complex and ever-changing network of information.When all processes involved in creating and maintaining DNA and protein function are working normally, the different compartments within a cell serving specialized roles—called organelles—can maintain the cell’s health and function. For an organ to work well, the majority of the cells that make it up need to function well. And for a whole organism to survive and thrive, all of the organs in its body need to work well.Aging can lead to dysfunction at any of these levels, from the sub-cellular to the organismal. Maybe a gene encoding an important protein for DNA repair has become damaged, and now all of the other genes in the cell are more likely to be repaired incorrectly. Or perhaps the cell’s recycling systems are unable to degrade dysfunctional components anymore. Even the communication systems between cells, tissues and organs can become compromised, leaving the organism less able to respond to changes within the body.Random chance can lead to a growing burden of molecular and cellular damage that is progressively less well-repaired over time. As this damage accumulates, the systems that are meant to fix it are accruing damage as well. This leads to a cycle of increasing wear and tear as cells age.The interdependence of life’s cellular processes is a double-edged sword: Sufficiently damage one process, and all the other processes that interact with or depend on it become impaired. However, this interconnection also means that bolstering one highly interconnected process could improve related functions as well. In fact, this is how the most successful anti-aging interventions work.There is no silver bullet to stop aging, but certain interventions do seem to slow aging in the laboratory. While there are ongoing clinical trials investigating different approaches in people, most existing data comes from animals like nematodes, flies, mice and nonhuman primates.One of the best studied interventions is caloric restriction, which involves reducing the amount of calories an animal would normally eat without depriving them of necessary nutrients. An FDA-approved drug used in organ transplantation and some cancer treatments called rapamycin seems to work by using at least a subset of the same pathways that calorie restriction activates in the cell. Both affect signaling hubs that direct the cell to preserve the biomolecules it has rather than growing and building new biomolecules. Over time, this cellular version of “reduce, reuse, recycle” removes damaged components and leaves behind a higher proportion of functional components.Other interventions include changing the levels of certain metabolites, selectively destroying senescent cells that have stopped dividing, changing the gut microbiome and behavioral modifications.What all of these interventions have in common is that they affect core processes that are critical for cellular homeostasis, often become dysregulated or dysfunctional with age and are connected to other cellular maintenance systems. Often, these processes are the central drivers for mechanisms that protect DNA and proteins in the body.There is no single cause of aging. No two people age the same way, and indeed, neither do any two cells. There are countless ways for your basic biology to go wrong over time, and these add up to create a unique network of aging-related factors for each person that make finding a one-size-fits-all anti-aging treatment extremely challenging.However, researching interventions that target multiple important cellular processes simultaneously could help improve and maintain health for a greater portion of life. These advances could help people live longer lives in the process.Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/15/skin-like-butterfly-wings-up-scientists-investigate-rare-deadly-disease/,Skin like butterfly wings: UP scientists investigate rare deadly disease,"As rare and deadly as it is poetically named, “Butterfly’s Disease” (scientifically known as “epidemolysis bullosa” or simply “EB”) has no known cure. But a handful of Filipino scientists are working their way towards a treatment.EB is a very serious disease, for those afflicted as well as for their families. Sufferers have severely fragile skin that easily blisters and tears even with the slightest touch, hence the comparison to . EB also varies in form, with mild cases that only affect the outer skin to extreme cases that injure even internal organs—an extreme condition that can lead to severe disability or even death. To further understand Butterfly’s Disease, scientists from the University of the Philippines – Diliman College of Science (UPD-CS) have focused on a genetic mutation known to cause an even rarer type of EB called Junctional EB (JEB), which affects more layers of the skin and can be fatal if it happens during early infancy. The onset of JEB has been associated with a genetic mutation called that affects how the body produces a protein called ITGA6-ITGB4 integrin (or Integrin A6B4 for short), which plays a vital role in joining together cells and tissues. The G237D mutation causes the production of malfunctioning Integrin A6B4 and decreases the presence of functional Integrin A6B4 on epithelial cell surfaces, leading to weaker cell adhesion in the skin tissue and resulting in severe skin blisters.Molecular biologist Dr. Neil Andrew Bascos and his graduate students, Kim Ivan Abesamis and Camille Anne Bagoyo, of the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (UPD-CS NIMBB) are investigating just how G237D affects the structure of Integrin A6B4.“We weren’t looking to study EB when we started this study,” Dr. Bascos narrated. “The main goal of the research has previously been looking at the function of integrins and their roles in cancer. Interestingly though, we’ve found that integrins may be associated with many other relevant diseases. Finding its involvement in this disfiguring disease provides us a means through which our research may be able to help the afflicted people.”In their computational study, the researchers investigated how the G237D mutation prevents Integrin A6B4 from forming, and from binding their targets properly. Some factors, such as the presence of calcium ions, were also observed to stabilize integrin interactions.The study sets the direction for further research into factors that can alter the effect of the G237D mutation on Integrin A6B4 function. Exploring these factors can pave the way for discovering cures for EB. “At this point, it’s very much basic research, medyo predictive pa. It would need proof of principle, but these studies give us concrete targets to test in the search for ways to alleviate the disease,” Dr. Bascos said.Some people with EB die as infants. Others manage to survive, but suffer from chronic illnesses that stem from its effects. Although little is currently known about effective treatments and cures for Butterfly’s Disease, the UP scientists remain steadfast in their quest to gain a deeper understanding of EB, in hopes of improving the quality of life of these patients and their families.Abesamis, K.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/13/acupuncture-restores-the-natural-healing-abilities-of-the-body-says-practitioner/,"Acupuncture restores the natural healing abilities of the body, says practitioner","Are you suffering from common office illnesses? Do not fret. Acupuncture has got your back.When you feel discomfort or pain, do you address the root cause of the disease or do you address the symptoms?While both Eastern and Western medicine concern themselves with realigning the flow of energy within the body, they vary in terms of where the focal point is placed. The focal point in traditional Chinese medicine is treating the person as a whole instead of the symptoms alone. On the other hand, Western medicine places a high emphasis on the treatment of symptoms through the prescription of a particular drug to address the pain.Acupuncture is a branch of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that deals with the insertion of needles in various points in the body in order to stimulate its ability to heal itself. (TCM and Ayurveda techniques make up Eastern medicine.)In some healthcare programs, intervention happens only when damage has been done. Vas Bismark, owner of Balanced Qi Health and Wellness Center, fills this gap by his proactive approach to healthcare. The certified acupuncturist sees his practice as a sustainable pain management program.“Acupuncture is one of those modalities that specializes in treating and protecting illnesses. For example, in the office setting, common illnesses are rampant but people think they are normal. You have frozen shoulders, back pain, hyperacidity, headaches, migraines – these are things people deal with on a daily basis. They are symptoms of illnesses they don’t have a direct answer to. Manage pain before it breaks out into something more serious. It is something I want to put a stop to by providing people with a sustainable pain management program,” Bismark explained.How can people benefit by putting acupuncture ahead of Western medicine to feel better and/or address their pain? “When a person undergoes acupuncture, they are optimizing the efficiency of the circulation of their systems. Acupuncture helps bring a person’s body function to its normal state—from your sleeping pattern, to your digestive, to your reproductive cycle [for women]. Acupuncture is designed to restore the natural healing abilities of the body,” he said.In this regard, one does not have to be sick or feel discomfort to enjoy the gains from acupuncture. When one is sick, acupuncture could make one feel better. It brings the body to a place where it could heal.On the other hand, when one is well, acupuncture helps reinforce the body against illnesses. It helps optimize its functions. In fact, Bismark has patients who visit him on a regular basis so that they could sleep better. They don’t have anything wrong with them, they just want to feel relaxed.Aside from having acupuncture, one is also encouraged to sleep on time and to eat meals at scheduled times.“Sleeping on time and regulating one’s eating time go hand in hand. If you don’t control your eating time it affects your sleeping time. Walk 6,000 steps a day. Give importance to consistency rather than intensity. As long as you are doing any form of exercise, be it 15 to 30 minutes a day, it is better than two to three hours of exercise once or twice a week,” he said.# # #"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/13/attain-demographic-dividend-gender-equality-by-investing-in-people-opportunities-experts/,"Attain demographic dividend, gender equality by investing in people, opportunities–experts","In the recent celebration of World Population Day, the Commission on Population and Development (CPD), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development (PLCPD) called for the advancement of gender equality and the attainment of the demographic dividend through investing in people and opportunities.“Currently, the Philippines is at a unique crossroads with its changing demographics. As the country is undergoing a demographic transition, the country will need to work towards demographic resilience, the quality or state of being able to adapt and thrive amid demographic changes,” said UNFPA Philippines Country Representative Dr. Leila Saiji Joudane in a press statement.Demographic dividend is defined as economic growth resulting from changes in a population’s structure and characteristics. Moreover, the groups expressed concern that the declining fertility rate of the Philippines will result in a window of opportunity where the country has a productive population that is larger than its dependent population. However, they warned that the demographic dividend is not automatic.They urged the country to make the right investments and policy decisions in order for it to reap its benefits, by investing in people throughout their life course.“The demographic dividend can be a powerful force. In order to reap its benefits, we need to ensure the rights of people, especially those most left behind, and provide access to quality education, health care, and employment opportunities. We need to also address gender inequality and other injustices that limit people from reaching their full potential,” Joudane noted. According to the 2022 National Demographic and Health Survey, the total fertility rate for 15- to 49-year-old women has declined from 2.7 children in 2017 to 1.9 children in 2022, which is now below the replacement level of 2.1. It is important to note the regional disparities in fertility rate across the country. In Manila, the total fertility rate is 1.2 while Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao’s [BARMM’s] total fertility rate is at 3.1.“Downward trends in fertility rates can be viewed as either an opportunity for a country’s development or a cause of concern. But as stated in the State of the World Population (SWP) Report 2023, we should be asking the right questions. It’s not whether the fertility rate is too high or too low or if there are too many or too few people. What is important is that all individuals, especially women, are equipped to thrive and exercise their basic human right to sexual and reproductive autonomy,” Dr. Joudane said.For World Population Day 2023, CPD, UNFPA and PLCPD held a high-level meeting at Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila to share with government, development partners, private sector and civil society leaders the importance of harnessing the 8-billion strong global population and the unique opportunity that the Philippines faces. UNFPA presented its SWP report during the event, which served as an avenue to discuss the critical issues on the demographic transition, gender equality, human rights, population growth, and opportunities for sustainable development.“We are keen on fulfilling the objective of optimizing demographic opportunities, as well as addressing the remaining population issues and challenges, so that we can maximize the Philippines’ socioeconomic dividend and have improved quality of life for Filipinos,” remarked Undersecretary Lisa Grace Bersales, Ph.D, CPD executive director. Bersales noted that there has been a steady decline in the country’s total fertility rate since 1973 from an average of 6.0 children per woman to 1.9 last year. “The steep decline in 2022 however needs further study to determine how much of the decline is the effect of Covid-19,” she added.“We have had unprecedented success in policymaking on population and human development in the last 10 years. We call on lawmakers and other decision-makers in the government to continue working to close the gaps in laws and policies so that the remaining challenges, including maternal deaths, are addressed and the rights of women and girls are fulfilled,” said Romeo Dongeto, Executive Director of PLCPD.Rizal Raoul S.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/13/a-child-succumbs-to-cancer-every-three-hours-doh/,A child succumbs to cancer every three hours–DOH,"Children are our future. They are our most precious and priceless resource. However, a cancer diagnosis in a child is a very difficult time for the child and the family.Childhood cancer is a serious and growing threat to the health and well-being of our children. It is an urgent matter which requires our collaborative and sustained action.While childhood cancer is curable, the heartbreaking reality is that every three hours another family will lose a child to cancer. In a solidarity statement released recently by the Department of Health (DOH), estimates show that every day, 12 children and adolescents, between zero to 19 years old, will be diagnosed with cancer. That’s more than 4,000 a year.Experts believe that this is likely an underestimate and there are many more children/adolescents who remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. “We stand in solidarity with all children/adolescents, and families affected by childhood cancer. We recognize that all stakeholders, must act synergistically and quickly, to address this major health issue, increase survivorship and improve the quality of life for childhood cancer patients,” the statement of the representatives of civil society, medical societies, professional associations and sectoral groups/organizations.They urged the government to take the following initiatives, to ensure that every Filipino child/adolescent with cancer, receives the necessary care and support, throughout their cancer journey:Increase the cancer assistance fund to provide financial assistance for timely diagnosis, specialized treatment, follow up care and rehabilitation for pediatric cancer patients.Expand Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) benefits to add 45 additional days, for children/adolescents with cancer and include retinoblastoma screening in the Konsulta package for eye examinations.Institutionalize palliative and pain management services, along with patient navigation and child life services in cancer centers, to provide psychosocial support, reduce emotional distress and improve the quality of life for children/adolescents with cancer.Ensure that cancer centers include provisions for state-of-the-art facilities, laboratories, medical technologies and equipment for pediatric oncology services.Maintain a robust pediatric cancer registry (hospital based and population based) to facilitate research, inform public health policy and guide allocation of resources.Establish hospital and community based nutritional build-up programs so that families of children/adolescents with cancer have access to nutritional education, counseling and supplements, to maintain good nutritional status and boost immune system while under treatment.Create responsive survivorship programs that will provide long-term follow-up care for childhood cancer survivors (e.g. free regular check-ups, screening for cancer recurrence and support for managing late effects of cancer treatment, etc).Encourage local government units to facilitate the enrollment of children/adolescents with cancer and survivors of childhood cancer as Persons with Disabilities to ensure their full inclusion in society and access to essential programs and services.Protect childhood cancer patients from discrimination in all areas of life, including education and healthcare, and promote a culture of empathy and support to ensure that they are not stigmatized and/or marginalized.Intensify information sharing and public education on childhood cancer in healthcare facilities. workplaces, and communities, and encourage schools to incorporate cancer awareness initiatives into their calendar of activities, including key health education class messages. Additionally, train Department of Education clinic teachers and barangay health workers on the early warning signs and symptoms of childhood cancer.Create an enabling environment in which private/business organizations and civil society organizations can contribute resources to support the implementation of pediatric cancer programs in hospitals and communities.They also call on all stakeholders, including government agencies, local government units, civil society organizations, health-care workers, medical professionals, patients, survivors and their families, to join hands in ensuring that every child with cancer receives the best care, protection; and support they deserve.“Together, we can make a difference and create a future in which no child suffers and dies from a treatable form of cancer. Let’s stand up for every child’s right to a cancer-free childhood. Lets fight together against this merciless disease with all our might,” the statement said.The Philippine Children’s Medical Center-Cancer and Hematology Division (PCMC-CHD) was designated by the DOH as the national end-referral center for children and adolescents with blood diseases and cancer.The Division is committed to provide quality and cost-effective comprehensive care to patients, to train healthcare providers and to extend this to a network of referral centers in the different regions of the country.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/13/updated-vaccines-required-for-better-stronger-protection-vs-covid-19-virus/,"Updated vaccines required for better, stronger protection vs Covid-19 virus","EARLY last month, an initial batch of 390,000 bivalent vaccine doses arrived in the country, courtesy of the government of Lithuania. It took almost a year for the vaccines to arrive as the country was already negotiating to acquire these vaccines last August 2022.Priority targets of the vaccination for the bivalent vaccines are health workers or the A1 population and the elderly or the A2 set. Those eligible should have had their second booster shots at least four to six months prior to getting bivalent vaccine jabs.As of July 2023, the Philippines remains under a low-risk case classification with roughly 2,000 active Covid-19 cases.Additional vaccines are in the pipeline since the Philippine government is still negotiating to get more of these “third” boosters from the COVAX (Covid-19 Vaccine Global Access) Facility, the global initiative that aims to ensure equitable and fair access to Covid-19 vaccines in every country.THE Department of Health (DOH) has long been advocating the acquisition of the bivalent vaccines that hopes to provide better and stronger protection for Filipinos against Covid-19. These vaccines are seen to provide protection against the original Covid-19 strain, the SARS-CoV-2, and the Omicron subvariants such as BA.4 and BA.5.Dr. Franco Felizarta, an infectious disease specialist and a member of the UP Medical Alumni Society in America (UPMASA), provided some updates on bivalent vaccines. He said that in the United States, monovalent vaccines are no longer being used. However, uptake is quite low.As to the global death curve and overall activity for Covid-19, Dr. Felizarta said with regards to the epidemic curves, the Normalcy Index is seen to be increasing to almost 100 percent. In 2020 and 2021, he said there were more than 10 million Covid-19 deaths per year for an estimated total of 25 million.“If you look at it now, there are less restrictions, no social distancing and minimal masking, at least in the US. Globally, despite the increase in activity, the emergence of newer variants and decreasing vaccine uptake, and deaths continue to drop, the world can now be transitioning from a pandemic to an endemic phase, which may be established in another year,” Dr. Felizarta pointed out during the latest Stop C.O.V.I.D. Deaths webinar entitled “Bivalent Vaccines, Nandito na: Ano ang Latest?” and organized by the University of the Philippines together with the National Telehealth Center.ACCORDING to Dr. Nina Gloriani, a member of the World Health Organization Scientific Steering Committee for Solidarity Vaccine Trials and former dean of the UP Manila College of Public Health, the original SARS CoV-2 virus continues to evolve and this requires the updating of Covid-19 vaccines. She said it is important that vaccines keep pace and be updated to match the strains of the virus that are circulating.She also reported that in the Philippines, the Pfizer bivalent vaccine was awarded with the Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) by the Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration, but only as a “booster” dose and not as a primary shot.Dr. Gloriani again reminded that although the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) was lifted May of this year, the SARS CoV-2 continues to circulate, where most cases are due to the Omicron subvariants. She also reiterated the importance of updating vaccines since immunity wanes over time, and the variants that emerge may evade previously generated immunity.“All persons should stay up to date with recommended Covid-19 vaccinations, including bivalent booster doses for those eligible. We now have to integrate Covid-19 vaccination into the country’s routine immunization program, just like the flu vaccines given in whatever season,” Dr. Gloriani said.FOR Health Secretary Dr. Teodoro Herbosa, he pointed out in a video message that the government’s tireless efforts to fully vaccinate Filipinos have enabled the country to strengthen its wall of immunity against the virus, which led to the re-opening of the economy and Filipinos’ gradual return and march toward a “better normal.”“We shall continue to apply our layers of protection, and with the arrival of the bivalent vaccines, the DOH will continue to make arrangements to secure additional vaccine donations from COVAX, which shall spark the expansion of coverage of bivalent vaccines for the general public.”He likewise encouraged more Filipinos to get vaccinated, whether the bivalent or monovalent ones, and get boosted so there’s no longer any need to face the fears of the past.Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/12/ched-eyes-grants-to-help-nursing-board-examinees/,CHED eyes grants to help nursing board examinees,"The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) on Tuesday bared plans to provide grants to tertiary education institutions to support the review classes of nursing board exam takers.CHED Chairman Prospero E. De Vera III disclosed they are planning to tap universities with “good track record in licensure tests” for the said initiative to help increase the country’s pool of licensed nurses.He noted 50 percent of those who take the Nursing Licensure Exam (NLE) pass the said test. “So we will hold special review classes for those employed in the DOH [Department of Health] and in private hospitals as aides or assistants so that they can pass the licensure test and we can produce more graduates,” De Vera said. Under the proposed scheme, private hospitals will pay for the review of their employees who did not pass the NLE. Meanwhile, CHED will give grants to qualified schools to provide the free reviews to non-board passers, who are not employed in medical institutions. “We’re going to negotiate with the schools on what rate they will apply and help mobilize funds for it on the part of DOH [Department of Health] and the private hospitals,” De Vera said. CHED noted the amount of the grant would differ per school depending on the rate they charge for their reviews, which may range from P6,000 to P10,000 per examinee. The government wants to boost the number of its licensed nurses since they remain in demand here in and abroad. Aside from increasing the number of NLE passers, the government lifted the 10-year moratorium for the creation of nursing board exams, which is expected to produce 2,052 new nursing graduates by academic year 2027-2028. It is also developing programs to train health-care associates and health-care assistants to help address local nursing shortages. “If the nurses are de-loaded of some of the work they do, they can focus on patient care to cover more patients,” De Vera said. Citing figures from the World Health Organization (WHO), CHED estimates the country needs to produce 126,044 additional nurses to meet local demand for the said health-care professionals.Image credits:"

Meanwhile, over 78 million individuals or 100.44 percent of the target population are vaccinated against Covid-19 while 23 million individuals were boosted.On the other hand, 7.1 million senior citizens or 82.16 percent of the target A2 population received their primary series.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/10/only-1-of-pinays-are-screened-for-cancer/,Only 1% of Pinays are screened for cancer,"SCREENING for breast and cervical cancer among Filipino women could be the lowest in the world, with just 1 percent of eligible women getting themselves screened, the first step to cancer prevention.Valerie Gilbert Ulep, senior research fellow at the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), said at a recent presentation of their study that “a big portion [of the] country’s cancer burden is preventable” if only more early screening can be conducted among women.Ulep said cancer patients in their most productive age of 40 to 69 years old account for most deaths, resulting in untold social and economic costs to the country. Data show that for breast cancer alone, 27,000 new cases are reported each year while 9,000 women die annually.Low screening has been traced to lack of funds provided by the government, especially for the poor. This results in very few government hospitals offering this screening service.Also, many fear finding out that one has cancer, and go for screening only when they are already suffering and it is too late.“We are diagnosing cancer patients at a very, very late stage,” he said, adding “it boils down to (conducting) comprehensive preventative and curative interventions for the population” to save those afflicted. The cancer screening rate in Malaysia and Thailand is 20 percent and “they are even worried that their rate is low,” Ulep said, adding that Cambodia and Myanmar have better numbers than the Philippines. The West has a 50-percent screening rate."

While the first two segments were catered to serious runners, the top executive noted that the 5 km was intended for the casual runners like a group of friends who usually just want to experience the fun of running with their peers.“Then, we do have kids run also which is one kilometer. So it’s actually an event not just for runners, not just for friends, but also for families. It’s very inclusive,” she said.“[That’s] what makes the Lazada Run so special aside from being a run mounted for the first time ever by an e-commerce platform in the country, is it also encourages families and friends to enjoy a morning of camaraderie and community,” added Lazada Philippines Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Carlos Barrera.WITH the launch of its new brand positioning dubbed “Add to Cart, Add to Life,” Lazada continued to find innovative ways to add value to consumers’ lives beyond its products online.“Because of the pandemic, we looked at the top growing topics and trends. We saw that it’s fitness and health,” Calderon bared.Since nobody in the e-commerce space has already done it, the company thought that it’s going to be relevant to stage and host an event that is connected to running because that is aligned to the passion of their customers.“It’s one way of us reaching out to our consumers who are really passionate about health and fitness, especially in the running community,” she explained. “So once they go out, go back to work or school, they want to look good, feel good and, of course, be the best versions of themselves.”AS the gun shot started the race, attendees were treated to surprises all throughout the event.The Lazada Run gave participants a one-of-a-kind experience with app-inspired rewards at the race village wherein attendees who ran faster and jumped higher through several boxes in the delivery dash took home some products and items.During the race proper, there were also Checkout Checkpoints where runners earned vouchers by running through the checkpoints spread across the race route. To motivate them to keep running to the finish line, there were also Running Vouchers—pacers who wore hanging physical vouchers that were up for grabs.“The vouchers and prizes they are also able to win along the way are an absolute bonus,” said the CEO.What’s more, surprise appearances from Lazada ambassadors Anne Curtis, Alden Richards, and Gabbi Garcia added fun and excitement to the participants. They led the morning warm-ups and joined the awarding of top finishers.There were also other popular showbiz personalities, social media influencers and beauty queens who graced the event. OPM band Mayonnaise closed out the show to the delight of attendees.’s nextTHE Philippines was the fourth Lazada territory in Southeast Asia to hold a national leg of the race.“We started in Vietnam. Then, we went to Indonesia. We just did Thailand last week. After Manila, we’ll go to Malaysia. And the final stop is in Singapore,” shared the head of marketing.The top 10 km and 21 km finishers will be sent to join the regional finale race at the Marina Barrage, Singapore on July 23.The 21 km top racers are Christine Hallasgo and Richard Salaño who won the female and male segments, with race times of 1:21:46 and 1:09:30, respectively.

Your ingenuity and brilliance are truly highlighted in pioneering this momentous event,” said Mayor Imelda Calixto-Rubiano of host city Pasay.Joining her were Congressman Howard Guintu, Department of Interior and Local Government Undersecretary Marge Gutierrez, Department of Information and Communications Technology Undersecretary Anna Mae Lamentillo, Department of the Tourism Chief Operating Officer Marga Nograles, Senator Grace Poe’s Chief of Staff Brian Poe Llamanzares, Taytay-Rizal Councilor Boknay Leonardo, and Tuguegarao Councilor Charo Soriano, who were recognized as Inspiring Young Filipinos.In its first staging of one of the biggest fitness events in the country and the rest of the region, Lazada stayed true to its commitment of making the Lazada Run a space for consumers to gain a rewarding real life experience beyond the shopping they do on the Lazada app.“We’re proud to have given Filipinos a running event that really stands out.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/06/more-gen-zs-putting-premium-on-health-wellness-through-compounded-drugs/,"More Gen Zs putting premium on health, wellness through compounded drugs","THE Covid-19 pandemic not only changed the way people around the world viewed health and wellness, inter-personal relationships, modes of communication, even working environments; it also created fear, insecurity, and anxiety, mainly due to the extended lockdowns that produced a long-term effect on most people.But a silver lining to this situation is that people had more time to look for better opportunities, new experiences. Many even made their isolation an opportune time to reflect, reassess and rediscover what they actually need and the essentials in life and not just want, to be more considerate, take time to analyze things further, prepare for the unexpected, and be more conscious of their surroundings and of other people, and their perception of health and wellness in relation to medicines and healthcare.In a survey done in February 2022 by health website druggenius.com, it revealed that one in three millennials took interest in vitamins and supplements since the pandemic started, with immune health and multivitamins as their most preferred supplements.Relatively, the survey also showed that the same number (one in three millennials) amped up their consumption of supplements and vitamins since March 2020. This proves that health and wellness became not only a top priority but also a major factor with regard to lifestyle changes.Even Generation Zs (Gen Zs) don’t want to be left behind on the issue of health and wellness as they became more receptive to discussing issues related to physical and mental health and are now more aware about issues on physical fitness. A recent report from management consulting firm Oliver Wyman even showed that Gen Zs are open to supporting health with new technologies.ASIDE from taking charge of their health, the future generation of Filipinos are also showing increasing interest in modern medications like compounded drugs, according to data provided by Apotheca Integrative Pharmacy (API), an online compounding pharmacy in the country, in an interview with BusinessMirror.The data showed that younger Filipinos are already into compounding medicine by the time they reach the age of 20, where the number of those taking this type of medicine grew 375 percent for only one year, or from 2021 to 2022. This year, the number grew further by 45 percent.In terms of medicine category, weight management products registered high numbers in terms of usage for 2021 and 2022 with 51 percent, and already reached 55 percent until May 2023.On the other hand, corticosteroids or anti-inflammatory medicines, also showed robust preference among Gen Zs, with usage reaching 88 percent in 2021, and 57 percent usage up to May of this year. Fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone are among the compounded medications offered by AIP under corticosteroids. Fludrocortisone works by helping the body maintain the balance of minerals and water while hydrocortisone calms down the body’s immune response to pain and itching and swelling.Nutraceuticals is also one category where millennials saw tremendous health benefits. According to AIP’s data, prescriptions for 2023 is now at 65 percent from a low 39 percent in 2021 and continues to observe steady growth among the mid-20s to early 30s age bracket, with those in the 31 to 33-year-old age group as among the most prominent users. Growing awareness of the benefits of adding natural and organic products to daily diets.With regards to the use of intravenous (IV) products, IV prescription recently gained traction among health enthusiasts. Usage was at a low 8 percent two years ago in 2021 but grew to 23 percent last year. There was a slight dip in IV drips this year but remained a relatively significant product in the 25 to 28 age group, but lower for those 30 years old and above.As a compounding pharmacy, API offers a variety of compounded solutions by integrating vitamin and mineral supplements in millennials’ and Gen Zs’ diets and make small positive changes that in the long-term impact overall health. Its Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) solution, for example, helps protect beneficial lean muscle mass while burning undesirable fat that is best when it comes to weight management.As the local pharmaceutical market continues to grow and adopt new innovations and technologies and with young Filipinos leading the charge in putting a premium on their health and wellness, AIP will position itself to be a constant provider of quality and personalized medicines that Filipinos can trust and rely on."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/07/06/doh-to-push-for-mass-drug-drive-against-neglected-tropical-diseases/,DOH to push for mass drug drive against neglected tropical diseases,"The Department of Health (DOH) has called on the public to support the mass drug administration against lymphatic filariasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) this July.“By giving out these medicines to communities that are at risk, we hope to be able to reduce the chances of spreading this disease and reducing its incidence,” said Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa. According to the World Health Organization, Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of communicable diseases that prevail in tropical and sub-tropical conditions in 149 countries which affect more than one billion people, costing developing economies billions of dollars every year. They mainly affect populations living in poverty, without adequate sanitation and in close contact with infectious vectors and domestic animals and livestock. In the Philippines, these diseases include leprosy, rabies, schistosomiasis, filariasis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and food and water-borne diseases.Filariasis is a parasitic infection of the lymph vessels. It is more commonly known as “elephantiasis,” which refers to the enlargement of the lower limbs due to the disease.The DOH said that filariasis is caused by parasitic worms known as filarial nematodes (Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori). These worms are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito.Most infected persons do not develop any symptoms but may still suffer from damage to the lymphatic system and the kidneys, and from an altered immune system. Those who do get symptoms may experience pain and swelling of the breast, vagina, scrotum, legs, and arms; pain in the affected lymph nodes; fever; chills; cough, difficulty breathing and wheezing, although these rarely occur.Since filariasis is transmitted via mosquitoes, protection from mosquito bites is essential in preventing the disease. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when working in farms or areas where filariasis is endemic. Sleep under a mosquito net or use mosquito repellent.STH, on the other hand, is caused by a different type of parasitic worms, the World Health Organization said.They are transmitted by eggs present in human feces, which contaminate the soil in areas where sanitation is poor. Infected children are nutritionally and physically impaired.For infected girls and women of reproductive age, blood loss exacerbates iron deficiency anemia and increases the risk of maternal and infant mortality and low birth weight.Control is based on periodical deworming to eliminate infecting worms, health education to prevent re-infection, and improved sanitation to reduce soil contamination with infective eggs.Safe and effective medicines are available to control infection.Soil-transmitted helminth infections are among the most common infections worldwide with an estimated 1.5 billion infected people or 24 percent of the world’s population. These infections affect the poorest and most deprived communities with poor access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene in tropical and subtropical areas, with the highest prevalence reported from sub-Saharan Africa, China, South America and Asia.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

A strategic harbinger is emerging from the East – business process outsourcing (BPO) to the Philippines. An intriguing blend of linguistic aptitude, cultural proximity to the West, and a skilled labor pool make this archipelagic nation an unexpected yet compelling choice., CEO of , one of the world’s leading experts on , sheds light on the significant shifts within the sector: “The Annual Enrollment Period (AEP) and Individual Enrollment Period (IEP) in Q4 each year have become pivotal moments, driving a surge in demand for licensed agents in the U.S. “The advent of the new year brings another wave – onboarding and customer care for health insurance members, freshly minted in the crucible of Q4’s enrollment period. Maczynski highlights the critical role of Filipino agents in this process: “Their empathetic approach to navigating complex health and life crises has become invaluable in our industry. They’re more than agents; they are the human touchpoint to drive improved outcomes for new enrollees.”Back-office processes are equally vital, and Maczynski emphasizes the importance of scale and precision in claims processing: “In the whirlwind of back-office operations, and BPOs specializing in claims processing have proven to be game-changers, providing a blend of volume management and quality that was previously unprecedented.”Yet, the linchpin in this intricate operation is stringent adherence to security and compliance measures. Maczynski affirms: “The industry is grounded in trust, and protecting data integrity is at the heart of this trust. The compliance to HIPAA, HITRUST, SOC2, and CMS requirements by the sector has set a new standard in the industry.”Facing challenges from cultural differences to data privacy concerns, the industry continues to adapt. Maczynski remains optimistic: “Yes, there are hurdles. But the relentless commitment to capacity-building, infrastructural enhancements, and process evolution in the Philippine BPO industry signals a promising future.”The rise of outsourcing to the Philippines signals a transformative shift in the health insurance industry. As Maczynski concludes, “In our increasingly interconnected world, the solution to our intricate challenges might reside in the serene warmth of the Pacific, within the energetic hub of , where empathy meets efficiency.”"

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/06/15/advocates-push-for-legalization-of-cannabis-has-many-benefits/,"Advocates push for legalization of cannabis, has many benefits","The legalization and propagation of industrial hemp can bring a lot of benefits to the country’s health, construction, economy and agriculture sectors, according to the champions of the usage of so-called most valuable plant (MVP).“I hope the Filipinos will realize the value of industrial hemp as an MVP because it can contribute a lot in the fight against climate change, boost agriculture, enhance sustainability and develop the health of the people,” explained Edison Ching, industrial hemp champion and co-founder of Sensible Philippines, in the recent Media Health Forum. Sensible Philippines is a registered non-profit advocacy and education organization focused on reforming the cannabis and drug policy in the country. Sensible PH recognizes the medicinal and industrial benefits of cannabis and hemp.To push for their advocacy, Sensible PH conducts educational and advocacy campaigns; organizes lobbying efforts to introduce cannabis and drug policy reform bills and resolutions in Congress; represents cannabis and drug policy reform advocacy on stakeholder consultations of government agencies and interacts and forces alliances with advocates internationally.Zarah Uytingban-Cruz, Program Specialist for the City of Sacramento Office of Cannabis Management, said advocates of decriminalizing the use of industrial hemp and cannabis must consistently discuss the issue to shift the public opinion and erase the stigma on pro-cannabis legislators and discuss thoroughly the benefits of legalizing cannabis.“Even if the public is not ready for that change, we must keep the conversation alive,” Cruz said. “The more we talk about it, people will change their outlook on a topic that is currently taboo in Philippine society.”Beside being well-suited to the Philippine climate, Ching said the Philippines can harness the vast potentials of hemp in various segments of the economy. In health, the Rodale Institute said hemp seed “has less than 3 percent tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and is non-psychoactive, is high in protein.” Being pest-resistant, industrial hemp doesn’t need pesticides or herbicides. Moreover, it fortifies soil health by eliminating weeds. Hemp also consumes less water than cotton. According to evohemp.com, hemp will only require less than 700 gallons of water to produce 2.2 pounds of hemp whereas it will require 5,000 gallons of water to produce only 2.2 pounds of cotton. Furthermore, hemp is a cheaper and sustainable alternative for construction. It will boost farmers as hemp farming consumes a little amount of water, enabling farmers to save on irrigation fees. “Hemp can be used to make textiles, building material, livestock bedding, paper products, bioplastics and more.”Overall, industrial hemp is a versatile and sustainable crop that can benefit the environment,economy, and health.“Nevertheless, industrial hemp is classified as hemp, and remains illegal in the Philippines,” Ching pointed out. “The Coconut Palace, the former official residence of the Vice President of the Philippines, is a great example of hemp,” Ching noted.He urged the country’s legislators to adopt a progressive stance on the legalization of industrial hemp as a lot of laws are preventing the growth of the plant. Earlier, former House of Representatives speaker and now Davao del Norte 1st District Rep. Pantaleon Alvarez filed House Bill No. 6783 calling for the removal of cannabis, cannabis resins from extracts, and tinctures of cannabis from the lists and schedules under R.A. 9165.Expounding, Alvarez stressed that including marijuana (cannabis sativa) on the list is ridiculous as it is apparently less hazardous compared to other allowed or controlled substances such as alcohol and cigarettes.Together with the Department of Science and Technology, the University of the Philippines, Cruz presented a paper before the Dangerous Drug Board (DDB) the benefits of industrial hemp and cannabis sativa. However, Cruz said every single aspect of the hemp has not been done because it’s illegal.Hemp is a specific type of cannabis known scientifically as Cannabis sativa.“Hemp was not a Frankenstein created in the laboratory,” Cruz said.Image credits: Rizal Raoul S.

It can also help a person manage their weight.On June 10, Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa, along with Taguig City Mayor Maria Laarni Cayetano, joined the nation in celebration of World Bicycle Day which aims to promote the use of bicycles as a sustainable, affordable and alternative means of transportation.“Biking is a simple yet effective form of exercise and helps in reducing the levels of pollution in the country,” Herbosa said. He added that the event in Taguig, dubbed as “The Pedal for a Sustainable Future—A World Bicycle Day Celebration,” is also aimed to raise awareness about the benefits of cycling for both the environment and the individual’s health and well-being. The bikers, numbering close to 700, ran a distance of 14 kilometers.World Bicycle Day is a global initiative started by the United Nations General Assembly which aims to promote the use of bicycles as a sustainable mode of transportation. During the event the Active Transport Playbook was also launched. This is an initiative of the Department of Health (DOH). The primary objective of the Active Transport initiative is to advance active modes of transportation, such as cycling and walking, as effective means to mitigate the prevalence of non-communicable diseases.The DOH has provided a fund amounting to P1.15 million for the promotion of the Active Transport Playbook. The fund can be used in all Active Transport events and activities that aim to encourage the adoption of active transport practices in the everyday lives of Filipinos.The one-day event included diverse undertakings like bike rides, challenges, cycling infrastructure, and workshops. These activities will contribute to nurturing a community of cyclists, working together to establish a more secure and healthier environment for all individuals.Today, the Bike Taguig Facebook Group is composed of over 24,000 cyclists and cycling enthusiasts who can benefit from the event by learning about the positive impact that cycling can have on the environment, such as reducing carbon emissions, improving cardiovascular fitness and reducing stress levels.“If Taguig can do this, I challenge every city to encourage and support biking both as an alternative mode of transportation and as a means to reduce pollution in the country,” Herbosa concluded.Biking also helps protect you from serious diseases such as stroke, heart attack, some cancers, depression, diabetes, obesity and arthritis.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/06/15/multi-stakeholder-collaboration-sought-in-war-vs-cervical-cancer/,Multi-stakeholder collaboration sought in war vs cervical cancer,"Teal is the color of cervical cancer awareness. Cervical cancer ranks as the 2nd most frequent cancer among women in the Philippines and the second most frequent cancers among women aged between 15 and 44 years of age.Data from the HPV Information Center says that “current estimates indicate that every year 7,897 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 4,052 die from the disease.”Last June 9, five historical landmarks and 13 hospitals within and outside Metro Manila turned the spotlight on cervical cancer by glowing up in teal as an act of solidarity in the call to eliminate cervical cancer through multi-stakeholder collaboration.In line with the “Women Bloom in SolidariTeal” event organized by healthcare company MSD in the Philippines, the Manila City Government lit up key landmarks which included the Rizal Monument, Kartilya ng Katipunan Fountain, Manila Clock Tower, and Rajah Sulayman Park. The Quezon City Government also expressed its support by lighting up the Quezon Memorial Circle.The 13 hospitals were Asian Hospital and Medical Center in Alabang, Muntinlupa and hospitals from the Mount Grace network, namely, Manila Medical Center in Paco, Manila; Capitol Medical Center in Quezon City; Fe Del Mundo Medical Center in Quezon City; VRP Medical in Mandaluyong; Grace Medical Center in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan; Mother Teresa of Calcutta Medical Center in Pampanga; Healthserv Los Baños Medical Center in Los Baños, Laguna; Westlake Medical Center, Laguna; Mary Mediatrix Medical Center in Lipa, Batangas; Lorma Medical Center in San Fernando, La Union; The Doctors’ Hospital in Bacolod, Negros Occidental, and Ciudad Medical Zamboanga.Cervical cancer survivors and supporters also gathered during the event at Baluarte de San Diego Garden, Intramuros, Manila.The SolidariTeal Walk highlighted not the fashion or clothes but the people wearing them and their advocacy: collaboration to push for innovative solutions to solve challenges and constraints involved in the implementation of cervical cancer elimination plans, programs, and initiatives.Among the participants of the SolidariTeal Walk were Women’s Administrator of the Philippine Football Federation (PFF) Isabella “Belay” Fernando-Dela Cruz; from Banna, Ilocos Norte, Mary Chrislyn Abadilla, a women’s health champion at the local level, and Beatriz McLelland, Miss Eco Teen Philippines 2022 and a staunch advocate of cervical cancer awareness. Despite its prevalence, medical experts and advocates believe that cervical cancer does not garner as much attention and support as other women’s cancers, such as breast cancer. That is why, through the SolidariTeal event, advocates invite the public to take part in promoting a safer and healthier future for all Filipino girls and women. Cervical cancer is not a one-woman battle. All stakeholders need to work together to provide girls and women access to preventive tools, as well as providing cancer patients access to innovative treatments through the Cancer Law.Cervical cancer is cancer of the cells in the cervix, the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. According to the World Health Organization, it is the fourth most common cancer among women globally and a large majority of cervical cancer (more than 95 percent) is due to the human papillomavirus (HPV).Symptoms of early-stage cervical cancer may include irregular blood spotting or light bleeding between periods; postmenopausal spotting or bleeding; bleeding after intercourse, and increased vaginal discharge, or it may have a strong or unusual color or smell.As cervical cancer advances, more severe symptoms may appear including persistent back, leg or pelvic pain, weight loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, and swelling of a leg or both lower extremities.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the most important things women can do to help prevent cervical cancer are to get vaccinated against HPV is to have regular screening tests and to go back to the doctor if the screening test results are not normal.In the fight against cervical cancer, there is solidarity in numbers.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/06/15/heart-valve-replacement-saved-a-womans-life-at-81/,Heart valve replacement saved a woman’s life at 81,"Eighty-one-year-old Julia Bonaobra-Yap had planned to enjoy a relaxing day at the spa. However, her day took a sudden turn for the worse when she experienced a severe allergy attack that caused her breathing difficulties. She was immediately taken to the emergency room, where she received first aid for her allergy symptoms. Unfortunately, her condition was so severe that she needed to be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Although she was eventually discharged and deemed fit, her relief was short-lived. In March 2023, Julia experienced what appeared to be another allergy attack that made it difficult for her to breathe. However, this time, she also felt a weight on her chest that caused her to lose consciousness. She was immediately rushed to the same hospital as before, but her condition was more severe than the previous attack, and her heart stopped beating.Thankfully, the hospital staff was able to revive her after six minutes, and she regained consciousness after a few hours. Although she was saved, doctors suspected that her symptoms were not just caused by an allergy attack. Julia was intubated while doctors conducted further tests, and they eventually discovered that the valve responsible for allowing the blood to exit the heart, was almost completely obstructed. They determined that the only way to save her life was to perform a Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) or Open-Heart Valve Replacement Surgery.TAVR is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that is used to replace a damaged aortic value in the heart. TAVR is a newer alternative to the traditional open-heart surgery which involves making a large incision in the chest to access the heart. TAVR is generally considered to be less invasive than open heart surgery and can be a viable option for patients who are at high or intermediate risk for complications with traditional surgery.Due to Julia’s age and health condition, Open Heart Surgery posed significant risks. Her frail body might not be able to handle the surgery and could worsen other pre-existing conditions. The longer recovery period may be too difficult to endure. Therefore, the family opted for TAVR as the most suitable alternative. However, during the pre-operation tests, it was discovered that Julia’s lungs were congested with fluid, which could further complicate her breathing. At Asian Hospital and Medical Center, a multidisciplinary team was created to handle Julia’s case with Dr. Fabio Enrique Posas as the Head Interventional Cardiologist; Dr. Marc Louie Del Rosario, Interventional Cardiologist, Dr. Gilbert Florentino, Electrophysiologist; Dr. Margrette Ruth Bernardo, Nephrologist; Dr. Edwin Dimatatac, Infectious Disease Expert; Dr. Lenora Fernandez, Pulmonologist; and Dr. Adrian Peter Desquitado, Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeon. This team of experts ensured that Julia would have the best intervention available with the least possible complication.On April 15, 2023, Julia underwent a successful TAVR procedure performed by a team of experts at Asian Hospital. This gave Julia and her family renewed hope, as her heart valve, which had only a 0.4 cm2 opening, was replaced with a new one with a 1.5 cm2 opening. This allowed for regular blood flow and adequate supply, improving her overall health.Julia has been discharged from the hospital and is currently in good condition. There is no more difficulty in breathing. While still under Occupational Therapy, she can already eat on her own and can walk at least 10 steps with the help of a walker. She actively participates in her Cardiac Rehabilitation sessions.Furthermore, she remembers her doctors, including Dr. Posas, whom she found to be one of the most handsome doctors during her stay. Dubbed as “The Heart Plumber”, Dr. Posas is currently the Head of Structural Heart Disease and Endovascular Therapy at Asian Hospital and was bestowed the Order of Lapu-Lapu with the Rank of Kamagi in 2018 for contributing “significantly to an activity pursuant to a campaign or advocacy of the President.”In addition to celebrating her second chance at life, Julia is also grateful to her entire medical team, including the nurses, for making her stay as comfortable as possible.To know more about Structural Heart Disease, contact the Asian Cardiovascular Institute at (02) 8-771-9000 locals 5751 and 8250."

In a recent report, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Philippines cited that as many as six to seven women die daily due to pregnancy-related complications and childbirth. Furthermore, UNICEF Philippines also reported that over 60,000 children die yearly before their 5th birthday due to complications from premature birth, intrapartum complications, and infectious diseases.Dr. Manuel Vallesteros, Chief of the Department of Health’s (DOH)) Child, Adolescent and Maternal Health Division, stressed it is vital to monitor every step of the mother’s pregnancy.“Getting good care before, during, and after pregnancy is very important for both the mother and child. Our goal is to reduce the maternal mortality ratio to 70 per 100,000 by 2030 and consequently reduce newborn deaths,” he said.Dr. Vallesteros also highlighted two important strategies: maternal health services (including antenatal care, facility-based delivery, and postnatal care) and the DOH Health Sector Strategy 2023-2028 to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal commitment for a safer pregnancy and childbirth, The Philippine Foundation for Vaccination also highlighted the importance of vaccination for pregnant mothers. Dr. Lulu Bravo, PFV Executive Director, explained, “We need to empower women, and vaccination empowers women. If they are healthy, then there won’t be any economic crises when going to the hospital. So what we need is legislation and health policies to support maternal immunization to improve women’s health and protect their rights.” “If our babies are healthy, they will grow up to be healthy as well and that will help our country as well,” said Dr. Sybil Bravo, Committee Head of Immunization for Women of Philippine Obstetrical and Gynecological Society (POGS).“Across all ages, the leading causes of morbidity among our women are respiratory infections,” Dr. Bravo said. “Respiratory viruses, like influenza, may lead to severe complications like heart attack or stroke. Pregnant women with the flu are at increased risk of late pregnancy loss, preterm birth, and low birth weight among newborns.” she noted. POGS recommends both the flu vaccine and Tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines during pregnancy.Rizal Raoul S.

Secretary Teodoro J. Herbosa said the DOH could no longer easily procure Covid-19 vaccines with the expiration of the national public health emergency this year.The state of public health emergency allowed the local use of Covid-19 jabs as long as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could issue the necessary emergency use authorization (EUA) for procurement.Without a public health emergency declaration, Herbosa said Covid-19 vaccines must now be registered with the FDA to be used locally. “So we hit a snag there, but we are trying hard to get all these bivalent [vaccines],” Herbosa said. Further complicating their vaccine procurement attempts, he added, is the high demand for Covid-19 jabs worldwide. “Remember we are not the only country that wants the bivalent, all other countries are also scrambling to get some of it,” Herbosa said. The DOH said it is aiming to purchase more vaccines since it currently has only 390,000 Covid-19 bivalent vaccine, which were donated by the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX). “This 390,000 jabs are really insufficient. So what we will have to do is to prioritize who needs it first,” Herbosa said. The said Covid-19 jabs will be allocated for the elderly, for those with existing comorbidities, and health-care workers. In preparation for the rollout of the said jabs, which arrived in the country this month, Herbosa said they have already started redistribution to their different regional offices.“We will continue to push for people to get vaccinated because it will prevent you, especially if you are at high risk of mortality, from dying,” Herbosa said."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/06/09/newer-heart-transplant-method-could-allow-more-patients-a-chance-at-lifesaving-surgery-2/,Newer heart transplant method could allow more patients a chance at lifesaving surgery,"Most transplanted hearts are from donors who are brain dead, but new research shows a different approach can be just as successful and boost the number of available organs.It’s called donation after circulatory death, a method long used to recover kidneys and other organs but not more fragile hearts. Duke Health researchers said Wednesday that using those long-shunned hearts could allow possibly thousands more patients a chance at a lifesaving transplant — expanding the number of donor hearts by 30%.“Honestly if we could snap our fingers and just get people to use this, I think it probably would go up even more than that,” said transplant surgeon Dr. Jacob Schroder of Duke University School of Medicine, who led the research. “This really should be standard of care.”The usual method of organ donation occurs when doctors, through careful testing, determine someone has no brain function after a catastrophic injury — meaning they’re brain-dead. The body is left on a ventilator that keeps the heart beating and organs oxygenated until they’re recovered and put on ice.In contrast, donation after circulatory death occurs when someone has a nonsurvivable brain injury but, because all brain function hasn’t yet ceased, the family decides to withdraw life support and the heart stops. That means organs go without oxygen for a while before they can be recovered — and surgeons, worried the heart would be damaged, left it behind.What’s changed: Now doctors can remove those hearts and put them in a machine that “reanimates” them, pumping through blood and nutrients as they’re transported –- and demonstrating if they work OK before the planned transplant.Wednesday’s study, conducted at multiple hospitals around the country, involved 180 transplant recipients, half who received DCD hearts and half given hearts from brain-dead donors that were transported on ice.Survival six months later was about the same –- 94% for the recipients of cardiac-death donations and 90% for those who got the usual hearts, the researchers reported in the .The findings are exciting and show “the potential to increase fairness and equity in heart transplantation, allowing more persons with heart failure to have access to this lifesaving therapy,” transplant cardiologist Dr. Nancy Sweitzer of Washington University in St. Louis, who wasn’t involved with the study, wrote in an accompanying editorial.Last year, 4,111 heart transplants were performed in the U.S., a record number but not nearly enough to meet the need. Hundreds of thousands of people suffer from advanced heart failure but many never are offered a transplant and still others die waiting for one.Researchers in Australia and the U.K. first began trying DCD heart transplants about seven years ago. Duke pioneered the U.S. experiments in late 2019, one of about 20 U.S. hospitals now offering this method. Last year, there were 345 such heart transplants in the U.S., and 227 so far this year, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing.In the Duke-led study, nearly 90% of the DCD hearts recovered wound up being transplanted, signaling that it’s worthwhile for more hospitals to start using the newer method.Sweitzer noted that many would-be donors have severe brain injuries but don’t meet the criteria for brain death, meaning a lot of potentially usable hearts never get donated. But she also cautioned that there’s still more to learn, noting that the very sickest patients on the waiting list were less likely to receive DCD hearts in the study.Schroder said most who received DCD hearts already had implanted heart pumps that made the transplant more difficult to perform, even if they weren’t ranked as high on the waiting list.The study was funded by TransMedics, which makes the heart storage system.___"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/06/09/cervical-cancer-coverage-a-top-priority-of-philhealth-in-universal-health-care/,Cervical cancer coverage:  A top priority of PhilHealth in Universal Health Care,"The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) provides coverage for cervical cancer screening through the Konsultasyong Sulit at Tama (Konsulta) primary care package and cervical cancer treatment through the Z Benefits. Since 2015, benefit claims for cervical cancer filed under the Z Benefits amount to P31 million. Acting PhilHealth President and CEO Emmanuel R. Ledesma, Jr. said.Each year in the Philippines, 7,897 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 4,052 die from the disease. Cervical cancer ranks second in cancers among women in the Philippines and the second most common cancer in women between the ages of 15 and 44 (DOH, May 2023). Warning signs of cervical cancer show abnormal bleeding or foul- smelling vaginal discharge, bleeding after sexual intercourse, persistent back, leg, or pelvic pain, and unexplainable weight loss.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends screening for cervical cancer from 30 years of age in the general population of women or earlier for sexually active women. Further, updated guidelines of the WHO recommend Human Papillomavirus (HPV) tests for cervical cancer screening, which is more cost-effective than cytology (i.e., Pap smear). In addition, the WHO also recommends the primary target of vaccination against HPV, which is the first line of defense against cervical cancer, are girls aged 9-14. The secondary targets for HPV vaccination are boys and other females whenever feasible and affordable.Meanwhile, in a recent report by Professor Dindo Manhit of Stratbase ADR Institute along with other Cancer Societies and Cancer-free Movement, their groups discussed evidence-based and cost-effective interventions that will scale up the elimination of cervical cancer in the Philippines and to officially launch the Zero Cervical Cancer Movement.PhilHealth acknowledges the groups’ effort to bring down the incidence of cervical cancer if not totally eliminate this catastrophic illness through boosting immunization, vaccination and treatment control programs and fully support their future projects in collaboration with other sectors. Furthermore, in response to their call to expand coverage of the Z benefits package for cervical cancer and even include HPV Screening in the soon-to-be introduced Konsulta Plus Package, the PhilHealth Chief has this to say. “ he added.Currently, PhilHealth has two Z Benefits packages that cover complete course of treatment for cervical cancer for stages IA1, IA2-IIA1 where it pays P120,000 for Chemoradiation with Cobalt and Brachytherapy (low dose) and P175,000 for Chemoradiation with Linear Accelerator and Brachytherapy (high dose). Ledesma also stressed the importance of more healthcare providers being contracted for PhilHealth’s Z Benefits Package for cervical cancer to ensure greater access to patients. he explained.Being business-savvy should be fun, attainable and A+.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/06/08/thriving-with-anxiety-dealing-with-lifes-ups-and-downs/,Thriving with anxiety: Dealing with life’s ups and downs,"Everyone feels anxious at some point in their life. The American Psychiatric Association defines anxiety as “a normal reaction to stress and can be beneficial in some situations.”It can alert you to dangers and help you prepare and be equipped to handle the situation. But for some people, anxiety can be an ongoing problem and can interfere in their everyday lives.In a recent webinar dubbed “Thriving with anxiety: Dealing with life’s ups and downs,” certified wellness and life coach Jenica Cabaguio said understanding the nature of anxiety and how it works is the first step in learning to manage it. The webinar was presented by Mindscapes which offers customizable and scalable programs to companies who wish to support their employees through their mental wellness journey; PhilCare, a health maintenance organization (HMO); Philippine Life Financial Assurance Corporation (PhilLife); and Stitch Tech Solutions.“Anxiety is a word we use to describe feelings of unease, worry and fear. It incorporates both the emotions and the physical sensations we might experience when we are worried or nervous about something,” said Cabaguio.Feelings of anxiety are a normal response to life challenges such as before going on stage, a job interview, an exam, or presentation.Cabaguio added that although anxiety can be unpleasant, it is related to the “fight or flight” response which is the normal biological reaction to feeling threatened.Cabaguio cited situations when anxiety becomes a problem. One is when these anxious feelings become overwhelming and are affecting your work or academic performance negatively. Anxiety that is not short lived but persists for a long time, impacting many aspects of your lives, is also a cause for concern.“It becomes a problem when anxiety stops us from doing the things we need to do. Or when we find that we are worrying all the time, perhaps about things that are just normal parts of everyday life or about things that may not happen,” added Cabaguio. Anxiety that is so strong can also lead to panic attacks.Cabaguio said there are several symptoms of anxiety manifested in the way a person thinks, feels, and behaves.“Your mind may be whirring with repetitive thought patterns, prone to dwell on negative experiences. You have difficulty concentrating, remembering things, or making decisions,” she explained.A person with anxiety also fears the worst and feels tense or nervous, restless or agitated, scared, and panicky.Besides, some other indications are struggling to sleep, loss of appetite or overindulging, avoiding friends and activities, losing interest or pleasure, and experiencing academic decline (for students).Cabaguio said it is time to seek professional help if anxiety has been bothering you for quite a while, is affecting your everyday life and getting in the way of your daily productivity over an extended period.Learning about the symptoms and treatment goes a long way in helping to understand anxiety, but there are also some things that you can do when feeling anxious.Cabaguio cited these four strategies in managing anxiety.“Learn mindfulness skills. Learn to think realistically. Learn to confront the situations you avoid in small steps. And adopt an anti-anxiety lifestyle,” shared Cabaguio.Mindfulness suggests that the mind is awake and aware and living in the present; rather than dwelling in the past or anticipating the future.“Staying in touch with the present in this way, from one moment to the next, may lead you to experience yourself differently, perhaps feeling less stuck or recognizing more strength, balance and confidence in yourself,” explained Cabaguio.Mindfulness is taught through meditation which involves deep breathing and awareness of body and mind.On the other hand, realistic thinking involves slowing down and considering all aspects of a situation—positive, negative, and neutral—before reaching a conclusion or decision about a course of action.To stay healthy and to avoid stress and anxiety, adhering to the “Anti-anxiety” lifestyle helps.This means eating well, developing good sleeping habits, engaging in regular physical activities or exercise, finding hobbies and having fun with friends, learning mindfulness and relaxation skills, limiting caffeine, alcohol, and smoking, and working towards a balanced life."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/06/08/oky-period-tracker-app-launched-to-help-educate-adolescents-on-menstrual-health/,Oky Period Tracker App launched to help educate adolescents on menstrual health,"Government agencies and development organizations called for better measures to provide young Filipinos with accurate and trustworthy information about menstrual health during the nationwide launch of the Oky Philippines Period Tracker App, an app made for and by Filipino girls. The app was launched in time for the global Menstrual Hygiene Day, observed every 28th of May, through the partnership of the Department of Education (DepEd), Department of Health (DOH), Commission on Population and Development (POPCOM), and National Youth Commission (NYC), with support from the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Australian Government, and Plan International.The event, “Oky for you, Oky for Me: Say hello to the period tracker app for Filipino girls, by Filipino girls,” tackled issues about menstrual health and hygiene management and featured demonstrations of the easy-to-use app.According to DepEd, 8 out of 10 schools provided access to sanitary pads to girls during School Year 2020 to 2021, a marked increase from 2017 to 2018, when only 60 percent of schools provided menstrual-hygiene products. While the improved access of these items in schools is remarkable, menstruation and sexual reproductive health rights remain sensitive topics for discussion. More concerning is that myths and misconceptions about menstrual health proliferate on social media, hindering girls’ access to important information critical to understanding their right to reproductive health. The Oky Philippines app was developed based on Oky, the world’s first menstruation education and period tracker app co-created by UNICEF with girls, for girls. The app, supported by the Australian Government, is a joint product of DepEd, DOH, POPCOM, NYC, and UNICEF Philippines, in partnership with Plan International. In localizing the app, the team consulted with girls living in different contexts in the Philippines, including indigenous peoples, out-of-school children, and children with disabilities. The results from the talks underwent vetting by adolescent health experts from government agencies and development organizations. Oky Philippines also includes content relevant to the Islamic culture, co-created with adolescents from the Bangsamoro Region. The Oky Philippines is a new platform for adolescents, which will be deployed through existing government programs such as DepEd’s Comprehensive Sexual Education, the “WASH in Schools” programs, and the joint campaign “I CHOOSE #MalayaAkongMaging” led by DOH and POPCOM.Moreover, sexual reproductive health is one of the seven priority areas of the DOH campaign: “Health is Life,” which focuses on health promotion to improve health outcomes. The Oky app is also consistent with NYC’s Philippine Youth Development Plan for Health. The Australian Government supports the localization of the app in the Philippines as part of its AUD 48-million Indo-Pacific Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights COVID-19 Surge Response. The program supports the Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Oky Philippines is free to download from Google Play Store. The app will be available in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao."

The event was also the hospital’s way of thanking members of the press for their support over the years.In his welcome remarks, AHMC President and CEO Dr. Beaver R. Tamesis pointed out that one of the most important lessons that the pandemic taught was that all Filipinos deserve the best health care.“So that is why we are here today. We want to let everyone know that we are here to serve. We are not only here for Alabang, but for all communities that need good health care and that means everyone around us,” Dr. Tamesis said.The hospital also introduced content creator Justine Luzares as the campaign ambassador for its digital platforms and gave sneak peek of the AHMC Wellness Card.He added that the “Alagang Deserve, Alagang Sulit” campaign was AHMC’s way of informing the world that the hospital will do “the best to bring the best of the world’s services, the best level of standards to our fellow Filipinos.”“Filipinos deserve the best health care. Alagang Asian is really top class and very global. Our standards exceed global standards and that is what Filipinos deserve. So, we want to make sure that we can reach everybody who needs the kind of services that we offer,” Dr. Tamesis said.For his part, AHMC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jose M. Acuin said Asian Hospital’s more than 1,000 doctors are committed to make this campaign work. He added that AHMC already had a track record of extending exemplary health care to ordinary families.“We performed a brain surgery on an engineer who had recently lost his job. We were able to help the patient pool the funds he needed the bayanihan way,” Dr. Acuin explained.To support the “Alagang Deserve, Alagang Sulit” campaign, Asian Hospital revealed its Wellness Card. Hennesy Lou E. Miranda, AHMC Director of Marketing and Patient Experience, explained that the hospital saw the need to come up with a tangible product that would offer value for money.“This is why we are launching the Wellness Card. We call this the Wellness Card because this promotes Wellness and this comes in two variants—the Basic and the Premium Card,” she explained.Card holders are entitled to avail of the Basic Five Package at the Center for Executive Wellness. The Basic Five includes CBC, urinalysis, fecalysis, chest X-ray, physical exam and free body composition analysis. Other benefits of card holders include up to 10 percent discount on certain outpatient services, free room upgrade for those who need to be confined, among others.“The Basic Package costs P2,800 so this is a perfect gift of wellness for your family and friends,” Miranda said.The campaign’s AVP was also launched during the media meet with content creator Justine Luzares featuring the hospital’s various services. The event was hosted by radio and TV host Mon Gualvez. On hand to provide entertainment were the Elite Pioneer Dancers and Emergency Room Nurse Angela Abrio.After the media meet at The Bellevue Manila, AHMC officials and employees gathered at the hospital lobby for the campaign’s grand launch. The program was similar to that of the media meet with Drs. Tamesis and Acuin and Miranda giving their remarks on the campaign and on the Wellness Card.Performing at the hospital launch were the St. Michael College of Laguna and the AHMC Doctors Chorale. There was also the unveiling of the new internal murals as well as the premier of the employee, doctors, and patients’ videos.The day ended with AHMC officials returning to The Bellevue Manila for the Ambassadors Night. Present during the event were the leadership team of Metro Pacific Health (MPH) headed by MPH CEO Dr. Harish Pillai and MPH President Augusto Palisoc.Testimonials from patients, employees and doctors sharing their best experiences at AHMC were the highlight of the night.“Thinking about this whole experience at Asian Hospital—we parents were also cared for, attended to and treated like family. And for that, we thank you Asian Hospital and Medical Center. God bless each and every one of you a thousandfold,” said Joyce Chua, the parent of one of the patient ambassadors.The performers at the Ambassadors Night were the Elite Pioneer Dancers, Marielle Tuason, Dr. Mike Santos.“With Alagang Deserve, Alagang Sulit, what I can promise you is that we will do everything we can for you, for your health,” Dr. Tamesis said."

This year’s theme is “Grow food, not tobacco.”In the Philippines, smoke-free advocates encouraged smokers to break the bad habit of smoking and spend more money instead on healthy food.HealthJustice Philippines and Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development (PLCPD) stressed that vices, like smoking and vaping, have a massive impact on a person’s overall financial health.They also cited that one of the results of the 2021 GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services) showed that among daily cigarette smokers, the average monthly expenditure was P1,273.90. The amount could have been spent to buy more nutritious food or on other necessities.To convey the bad impact of smoking, smoke-free advocates and the city government of Manila recently launched a photo exhibit at the Manila City Hall, in time for the commemoration of World No Tobacco Day on Wednesday, May 31.With the theme “We need food, not tobacco,” the exhibit sought to convey the powerful message that tobacco does not have any redeeming value, whereas food does.The photo exhibit was organized through the collaborative efforts of Manila City Vice Mayor John Marvin “Yul Servo” Nieto, alongside HealthJustice, PLCPD, Child Rights Network, Social Watch Philippines, Philippine Smoke-Free Movement, Campaign for Tobacco-free Kids, Aktib, Parents Against Vape, and Action for Economic Reforms.Nieto said that the exhibit aims to make people aware of the bad effects of smoking not just on the smokers’ body but also on the people around them. Second- and third-hand smoke also pose harm to even non-smokers.“Instead of spending on cigarettes that will only do harm on our health and our source of living, we should prioritize food,” Nieto said during the launch of the photo exhibit.Nieto also underscored the role of the local government, like the city of Manila, in spreading awareness to help the smokers in the city quit for the sake of their health.The Vice Mayor also stressed the need to strengthen the smoke-free policy of the nation’s capital.“We are coordinating with different civil society groups to create smoke-free solutions in Manila. Our target is for the city’s public spaces to be 100 percent smoke-free,” Nieto said.For his part, Child Rights Network Convenor and Executive Director of the PLCPD Rom Dongeto thanked the city of Manila for “leading the way towards pursuing local policies for the protection of children’s health.”“Child rights and health advocates across the country fully support this exhibit’s message of prioritizing healthy food over ‘no good’ tobacco and doing everything possible to ensure that all Pinoy kids have healthy lungs and are able to eat healthy food,” Dongeto explained, as he expressed hope that other LGUs will follow suit.The photo exhibit captured the issue’s “raw and unfiltered truth.”Key parts of the exhibit featured candid moments in workplaces across the city, including tourist areas, malls, transport areas and government offices, to highlight not only the struggle of the common people but also the added burden tobacco use puts on these people’s lives.Likewise, the Department of Health threw its support behind the health groups as they encouraged the public to quit smoking.“Sa Bisyo Wala kang panalo, Quit now!,” the DOH said.For those who want to stop smoking, the DOH said that they may reach DOH Quitline 1558.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/06/06/solmux-advance-suspension-more-zinc-more-potent-vs-cough/,"Solmux Advance Suspension: More Zinc, More Potent vs Cough","The country’s leading and most-trusted pharmaceutical company Unilab Inc. has released Solmux Advance Suspension, which has been proven to be more potent against cough with phlegm due to its double Zinc formulation. Solmux Advance Suspension belongs to Unilab Consumer Health Group’s (ULCH) Solmux line of over-the-counter cough medicines that include the Carbocisteine Solmux and Carbocisteine + Zinc Solmux Advance Capsule. Solmux Advance Suspension has twice the amount of Zinc than its predecessor Solmux Advance Capsule as studies proved the importance of Zinc in boosting the efficacy of Carbocisteine in resolving cough. “Our studies showed that the combination of Carbocisteine and Zinc is very effective in treating cough with phlegm, which prompted us to offer to the public Solmux Advance, the first cough medicine in the country and probably the whole world to be fortified with Zinc,” Leevan Fong, Brand Manager of the Solmux line, shared. what are these clinical studies? It is medical affairs which runs clinical studies team Based on an observational study which was done by an independent investigator, the combination of 500 mg Carbocisteine and 5 mg Zinc present in Solmux Advance Capsule has been proven to have reduced the symptoms of cough in 3 days and resolution in just 5.52 days. Carbocisteine causes phlegm to be less thick and sticky and thus easier to cough up and expel, while Zinc has been found to play an important role in highly proliferating cells of the human body, like the immune system. The new variant, Solmux Advance Suspension, contains 27.44 mg of Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate for every 60-ml bottle. This means that every 10-ml dose of Solmux Advance Suspension has a potent combination of about 500 mg of Carbocisteine and 10 mg of Zinc. “We have been receiving positive reviews of the product from our customers and trade partners. We are elated that the public quickly embraced Solmux Advance Suspension. The soothing menthol effect made them instantly feel relief after taking the suspension,” Fong added. Dr. Jonas Policarpio, Medical Director of ULCH, said the release of Solmux Advance Suspension shows the commitment of Unilab to continuously develop innovative medicines, especially now that the world is still in the midst of the pandemic while experiencing abnormal weather patterns. Recent data from the Department of Health showed that the country has been recording about 1,000 new Covid cases daily over the past two weeks, with the positivity rate in Metro Manila reaching 25 percent. “With more people getting sick due to Covid and sudden changes in the weather, we need to have an advanced mindset and be on guard always when it comes to our health and safety and those of our loved ones,” Policarpio stressed."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/06/05/cervical-cancer-lecture-spotlights-on-achievable-who-targets-through-multimodal-treatment/,Cervical cancer lecture spotlights on achievable WHO targets through multimodal treatment,"The Philippine College of Surgeons Cancer Commission Foundation, together with Cancer Coalition Philippines and Philippine Cancer Society, held a 2-day Philippine National Cancer Summit to discuss with healthcare providers and esteemed medical professionals the ways to bridge the gaps in cancer care in the Philippines.According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, breast, lung, colorectum, liver, and prostate cancers are the top cancer cases in the Philippines in 2020. These, and other types of cancers, result in over 92,00 deaths. Apart from the top 5 cancer types, cervical cancer is another contributor to this number.Cervical cancer ranks second among the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. There is a risk of cervical cancer when a female is infected with HPV human papillomavirus (HPV). The immune system usually detects and controls this infection. However, when the body’s immune system is weakened, high-risk HPV infects cells and could turn into pre-cancerous cells. In a year, an estimated 7, 897 cases of cervical cancer among women of all ages, and 4,052 of those can result in death.To reduce these numbers, the World Health Organization (WHO) created the Cervical Cancer Elimination Initiative where 90% of girls must be fully vaccinated against HPV by 15 years old; 70% of women must be screened twice within 5 to 10 years, and 90% of women with pre-cancer are treated and 90% of women with invasive cancer are managed by 2030.In line with this, Dr. Efren J. Domingo, Gynecologist-oncologist, discussed in a lunch symposium sponsored by healthcare company MSD in the Philippines, the state of cervical cancer detection, care, and treatment here in the country in his lecture, “Pursuing the Goal of Cervical Cancer Elimination in the Philippines.”He shared about how the age of sexually active females became earlier over time. In his presentation, it was discussed that female adolescents ages 14 to 15 are already sexually active, therefore having a higher chance of encountering HPV. HPV 16 and 18 are two of the high-risk HPVs commonly responsible for cervical cancer.Early protection and screening are essential to achieving a higher survival rate. A study has shown how the HPV vaccine has greatly reduced the incidence of cervical cancer by up to 90% in a sample size of 1.7 million women under age 17. Dr. Domingo also shared how early detection also allows oncologists to implement the best solution for early-stage cancer up to Stage IIA: surgery. This procedure greatly reduces the capacity of the cancer to spread to the lungs, liver, and brain.“In the Philippines, because of our national handicap, our coverage of vaccination is still far from ideal. We still have to reach out to the younger women to capture the best protection before they meet the culprit virus,” Dr. Domingo mentioned.Furthermore, based on Dr. Domingo’s lecture, while the government started vaccinating women in 2006, the country’s archipelagic nature hinders organizations and medical professionals from reaching out to more women across the country. Expenses for the vaccine and testing also come from the patient, which influences them to no longer get the vaccine and test.As such, women frequently consult late and are later diagnosed when the cancer has become advanced.Chemoradiotherapy is the standard regimen in treating advanced cancer. It is a combination of chemotherapy where the oncologist administers cancer-destroying drugs, and radiotherapy, where radiation is used to destroy cancer cells.The GOG 240 trial has also shown significant results in the advanced cancer patient’s survival rate. In the GOG 240 trial, using various immunotherapy drugs together showed significant results in the patient’s survival rate.Since multi-modal treatment has a high efficacy rate, Dr. Domingo also shared how the implementation of immunotherapy, in addition to chemoradiotherapy, could bring hope to advanced cervical cancer patients.“First-line treatment should be the present treatment for those with the complicated disease profile,” Dr. Domingo stated. He added that immunotherapy, together with chemoradiotherapy, should be used as first-line treatment in cases of advanced recurring cancer.“From the 1999 clinical announcement of a chemotherapy drug as the most remarkable achievement against cervical cancer, the next event happens now in our time. We are lucky to witness it. Together with chemotherapy, the administration of immunotherapy will achieve probably the biggest hope of a cure for the patients of this otherwise hopeless disease.” Dr. Domingo believes that with this line of treatment, WHO’s 90-70-90 goal by 2030 is achievable through the support of the government and the private sector. This, along with the implementation of the Universal Healthcare Law and the National Integrated Cancer Control Act, cervical cancer vaccination, screening, and treatment for all Filipino women is a plausible future.The BusinessMirror provides readers with a broader look at today’s business in these challenging times.

The regulations take effect Aug. 1 and will be phased in. King-size cigarettes will be the first to feature the warnings and will be sold in stores by the end of July 2024, followed by regular-size cigarettes, and little cigars with tipping paper and tubes by the end of April 2025.“This bold step will make health warning messages virtually unavoidable,” Mental Health and Addictions Minister Carolyn Bennett said Wednesday.The warnings — in English and French — include “poison in every puff,” “tobacco smoke harms children” and “cigarettes cause impotence.”Health Canada said the strategy aims to reduce tobacco use below 5% by 2035. New regulations also strengthen health-related graphic images displayed on packages of tobacco.Bennett’s statement said tobacco use kills 48,000 Canadians every year.Doug Roth, chief executive of the Heart & Stroke charity, said the bold measure will ensure that dangers to lung health cannot be missed.The Canadian Cancer Society said the measure will reduce smoking and the appeal of cigarettes, thus preventing cancer and other diseases.Rob Cunningham, senior policy analyst at the Canadian Cancer Society, said health messaging will be conveyed in every puff and during every smoke break. Canada, he added, will have the best tobacco health warning system in the world.Tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship are banned in Canada and warnings on cigarette packs have existed since 1972.In 2001, Canada became the first country to require tobacco companies to include picture warnings on the outside of cigarette packages and include inserts with health messages.Image credits:"

Women have long faced stigmas and taboos surrounding these matters, often preventing them from seeking the care and support they need.However, amidst this backdrop of change, renowned feminine care brands Modess and Carefree are fearlessly championing female empowerment, and dismantling barriers surrounding this vital aspect of women’s lives.Recognizing the significance of early education on menstrual and vaginal health, Modess and Carefree go beyond just offering high-quality and easily accessible products in the market. They are also on a journey to shape the perspective of the next generation of women through their initiatives.“This Menstrual Health Month, we are dedicated to raising awareness about menstrual and vaginal health. We also advocate for improved access to feminine hygiene products and education, which can help support women in their daily lives,” says Nica Rollan, senior marketing manager, feminine care franchise, Kenvue Philippines.Modess is dedicated to empowering women by promoting menstrual health education. Using digital platforms and partnering with key opinion leaders, they challenge the stigma surrounding periods and combat the shame women often feel. “There is a common misconception among people that menstruation involves the discharge of dirty blood. That’s why I take the time to explain the menstrual cycle and the anatomy of the uterus to patients to help them understand that menstruation is not actually dirty blood, but rather the shedding of the uterine lining due to hormonal changes in the absence of conception,” shared Dr. Kristine Tangco, obstetrician-gynecologist. Through open and honest discussions, Modess creates a supportive environment where women can embrace their bodies and feel confident throughout their menstrual journey.Moreover, they offer an extensive range of products designed to provide women with protection during their menstrual cycles. “Physical activities can alleviate menstrual pain, reduce symptoms, and provide relief from stress and anxiety,” added Tangco. With their exceptional product line, Modess empowers women to live their lives to the fullest without being held back by their periods.Meanwhile, Carefree takes advantage of its social media presence and engages with experts to educate women on maintaining vaginal hygiene in their daily routines. The brand courageously addresses taboo topics such as odor, discharge, and everyday wetness, imparting valuable information to empower women and encourage open discussions on these important matters.Through initiatives like the #CarefreePantyLove campaign, Carefree actively works to break the stigma and normalize conversations around vaginal health, aiming to create a supportive environment where women feel confident and comfortable in their bodies.Modess and Carefree understand the value of collaborating with influential women who genuinely connect with Filipinas. These partnerships have proven to be transformative, inspiring and empowering women while shedding light on important initiatives. For example, Modess teamed up with BINI for the uplifting #WalangDudaWithModessLong campaign, encouraging teenage girls to embrace their full potential even during their menstrual cycle. Meanwhile, Carefree partnered with Rei Germar to bring attention to the importance of intimate care as an essential aspect of self-care, fostering conversations around taboo topics related to vaginal health. Together, Modess, Carefree, and their partners strive to empower women, break barriers, and create a more informed and confident community.Realize the extraordinary power of everyday care today.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/06/01/deped-to-strengthen-campaign-against-smoking-vaping-for-a-healthier-nation/,"DepEd to strengthen campaign against smoking, vaping for a healthier nation","FOR someone, regardless of age, to be enticed to take that smoking whiff can be attributed to a lot of factors, whether through peer pressure from most-of-the-time immature friends, classmates, neighbors, or perhaps even strangers in a public place like a bar.One may promise not to give in to temptation, but is nevertheless defeated by relentless prodding, that it’s just a simple puff that may seem quite harmless. However, one ends up liking it—not just liking it but sadly, getting addicted to it.And that supposedly simple and innocuous puff again claims a life, a life destined to suffer from other health-related upheavals.THE 2021 Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) revealed that among adults or those aged 15 years and up, 15.1 million currently smoke, or about one in every five Filipino adults, with 34.7 percent composed of men and 4.2 percent represented by women, and 1.5 percent are engaged in using smokeless tobacco products, 2.3 percent of which are men and 0.7 percent women.On June 4, 2019, Congress ratified Republic Act 11346, a piece of legislation that imposes an excise tax, or a tax on the production, sale or consumption of a commodity, such as fuel, alcohol and tobacco, among others.Still, despite legislative measures enacted to stymie the use of tobacco, it continues to be a pressing public health concern according to Dr. Ted Herbosa, a former Department of Health (DOH) official and public health champion, who was one of the panelists during a recent forum held at the Kamuning Bakery Café in Quezon City in celebration of World No Tobacco Day on May 31, 2023. This is a global initiative that seeks to raise awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco use and to advocate for a smoke-free future, and have a healthier, happier Philippines, and whose theme this year is “We Need Food, Not Tobacco.”DR. Herbosa, who said his own father was a victim of the bad effects of smoking, also said there is a need to re-examine the approach in combating tobacco, which already entered another form for consumption, using a specific device that is now called “vaping,” or more popularly called as “E-cigarettes” or “e-cigs.”The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the use of e-cigarettes remain unsafe for kids, teens and young adults since most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which the CDC said is highly addictive and may harm adolescent brain development, and perhaps other harmful substances.With the introduction of vaping, Dr. Herbosa said this shifted the fight against the dreaded tobacco but added that “we continue to have a vision wherein the government can implement more measures on tobacco control to protect public health, strengthen tobacco control laws, raise awareness on the dangers of smoking, and impose stricter regulations on tobacco advertising, packaging and sales.”He urged the public to continue to bring the fight against tobacco consumption through these efforts, together with the observation of World No Tobacco Day 2023. “We have to double our efforts in this fight so that the next generation will live in a smoke-free environment. It is crucial that we prioritize their health and wellbeing.”He also called on the smokers, expressing that quitting is not an easy task but it is a journey worth embarking on. A former smoker himself who was able to quit, Herbosa emphasized that they can also kick the habit. He said that there are several stop smoking or smoking cessation clinics that the government and the private sector helped put up in order for smokers to succeed in quitting smoking. Every step has been taken to ensure a smoke-free life in the future, Dr. Herbosa said, and he also believes in the value and the power of educating the youth about the bad effects of smoking on their health.“Knowledge is our most potent weapon in this battle against tobacco addiction, and we thank our partners from government, civil society and other organizations in helping bring out the message of a smoke-free society.”FOR Dr. Dexter Galban, Assistant Secretary for Youth Affairs and Special Concerns at the Department of Education (DepEd), the first-ever medical doctor appointed as assistant secretary at the agency and is also a registered nurse, he emphasized that the DepEd’s primary role is to defend and protect the future of the country’s learners, the future of the nation, and that includes defending them against the scourge of smoking and vaping, he said.“The primary targets of the tobacco industry and those that promote vaping are the young learners because they are seen as replacement smokers or vapers because those who have been affected physically are now suffering the consequences, and that’s why they need more young people to get into the habit,” Dr. Galban explained.And this is where the DepEd comes in, Dr. Galban said. He pointed out that the agency has already released a Department Order creating various tobacco control measures and guidelines, and an expanded order will now include vaping. He said that tobacco and vaping, at the end of the day, are forms of substance dependence, and these are dangerous to the youth because this may lead the youth to engage in drinking alcohol or worse, drugs.He likewise reiterated that the DepEd will continue to exert efforts, revise its policies, and work with its partners to ensure that it will defend the future of the country’s learners, and to keep them resilient. “Resilience is key to make the country’s young learners critically minded so that they will not become victims of the strategic marketing efforts of the tobacco industry and those who champion vaping.”"

MCM was represented by Chairman of the Board Ning I. Singh MD, and management consultant Uriel S. Halum MD.The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) estimated that one out of 13 Filipinas have the tendency to develop breast cancer in their lifetime, making them significantly under high risk. Similarly, the Global Cancer Report, which surveyed 15 Asian countries, found that the Philippines has the highest breast cancer death rate among its counterparts.Countless studies and expert recommendations have shown that higher survival rates are possible through early detection tests such as breast ultrasound and mammography. But these procedures are prohibitively unaffordable or low-income countries, making access to these tests highly significant to any tactic aimed at tackling the problem of breast cancer. “We believe [that by making these tests more accessible,] we can change that,” Biazon stressed.Image credits: Roderick L.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/06/01/unfpa-commends-house-committee-for-approving-bill-that-addresses-adolescent-pregnancy-in-phl/,UNFPA commends House Committee for approving bill that addresses adolescent pregnancy in PHL,"The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Philippines recently commended the House of Representatives Committee on Youth and Sports Development for recently approving a bill that addresses adolescent pregnancy in the country.“UNFPA Philippines appreciates the recent progress of the adolescent pregnancy bill at the House of Representatives since teenage pregnancy was already declared a national social emergency. UNFPA supports the pursuance of legislation that would expand the choices of adolescents to sexual and reproductive health services without discrimination,” said UNFPA Philippines Country Representative Dr. Leila Saiji Joudane, who previously served as a resource person for the deliberation of the bill.Furthermore, Joudane said UNFPA has also been closely monitoring a counterpart bill at the Senate which is awaiting plenary discussion.“Adolescent pregnancy is one of the biggest challenges that the Filipino youth are facing today. UNFPA looks forward seeing the adolescent pregnancy bill approved by both chambers of Congress and enacted into law,” Joudane noted.“Early and unintended pregnancy has great repercussions on a young person’s health and future,” she added, explaining that it is often the reason for adolescents to drop out of school and being unable to secure jobs with adequate pay.Although adolescent pregnancy among those 15 to 19 years old has decreased to 7.2 percent in 2021 from 14.4 percent in 2013, Joudane pointed out that the Philippines still has one of the highest adolescent birth rates among ASEAN countries. The number of births by mothers aged 10 to 14 years has also shown a slight increase (1,903 in 2016 and 2,113 in 2020 according to the Philippine Statistics Authority).“This also means that the Philippines is losing out on the opportunity of accelerated economic growth that we could achieve if the Filipino youth are able to reach their full potential,” Joudane said, adding that one out of three people in the Philippines are below 18 years old.The UN agency also highlighted an alarming trend: that 59.5 percent of adolescent births were fathered by adult men older than 20 years old. Because of this, “It is important that the Filipino youth are empowered and educated when it comes to their sexual and reproductive health and rights. They should be protected from all forms of violence and harmful practices such as sexual exploitation,” the UNFPA country representative said.Among the recommendations previously presented by UNFPA Philippines to both chambers of Congress during the deliberation of the adolescent pregnancy bill is the accelerated provision of Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) for all children and adolescents. An initial report from the Department of Education last January 2023 showed that only around 1.1 million learners or about 3.4 percent of the estimated 32 million young Filipinos aged five to 19 years old were reported to receive CSE.She said UNFPA also called for adolescent access to sexual and reproductive health services without parental consent. “The Philippines’ unmet need for family planning among young women aged 15 to 19 (27.9 percent) is significantly higher than any other age group. It means that adolescent girls are already in need of family planning and requesting for family planning, but they cannot have access to family planning,” Joudane said.Since there is no evidence, Dr. Joudane debunked the myth that access to contraception makes adolescents more sexually active.“There are global reports showing data that prove that the ‘abstinence-only’ approach is ineffective and programs that combine a focus on delaying sexual initiation with proper information on contraceptive use are more successful,” she said. “That is why it is important to accelerate the roll out of CSE nationally, to provide correct information to adolescents which will allow them to make informed and responsible decisions on their health.”Besides ensuring access to quality sexual and reproductive health services for adolescents as part of the Universal Health Care Law, UNFPA also recommended addressing harmful stereotypes and social barriers that push adolescents, especially girls, into early unions and pregnancy.Other recommendations included addressing the needs of vulnerable groups; engaging youth, especially boys; protecting youth against poverty, child marriage and rape; providing opportunities for adolescents and young mothers; and generating more data and evidence on adolescent pregnancy in the Philippines.Joudane said having laws that uphold the rights of adolescents, especially girls, are in accordance with key human rights treaties ratified by the Philippines, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).Globally, UNFPA is promoting commitments to achieving three transformational goals by 2030: ending preventable maternal deaths, ending unmet need for family planning, and ending gender-based violence and other harmful practices against women and girls including child marriage.In the Philippines, UNFPA works with the government, civil society, development partners, other UN agencies, academe, and the private sector to reach those furthest behind first and leave no one behind, especially young people, the poorest, the conflict and disaster-affected, indigenous peoples and people with disabilities.Rizal Raoul S.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/05/30/artificial-intelligence-a-silver-bullet-to-enhancing-healthcare-workers-jobs-and-improving-patient-care-in-the-philippines/,Artificial Intelligence – a silver bullet to enhancing healthcare workers jobs and improving patient care in the Philippines,"The pandemic spotlighted two big challenges in the Philippine healthcare system – long wait times and staff shortages. While we are gradually coming out of the pandemic, we are not free of these challenges. With time, these challenges will intensify as illnesses like cancer and cardiovascular diseases will increase, contributed by an aging population and the rise of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).In Asia and the Pacific, the estimates that the percentage of those aged 60 years or over will increase from 13.6% of the total population in 2020 to 25% by 2050. In the Philippines, it is estimated that senior citizens will account for 14% of the population by 2035. We are also seeing an increase in cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes, which account for 68% of deaths locally in the Philippines. With the growing aging population and rise of NCDs, we will see patient demand increasing, placing a greater burden on our healthcare systems and leading to longer patient wait times.While we often hear about treatment options, diagnosis and monitoring of diseases are often overlooked. If hospitals are not able to diagnose patients efficiently and accurately, this trickles down to an increase in patient waiting time, exacerbating their medical cases, increasing patient costs and resulting in more stress on the overall health system.Public health policies must be shaped to address these challenges. While local initiatives such as the Universal Healthcare Act and the National Integrated Cancer Control Act aim to ease financial burdens and create greater access to treatment, technology can be a silver bullet in addressing these challenges long-term.Artificial intelligence (AI) has long been highlighted as a key to tackling the major challenges facing healthcare systems today as it can automate and accelerate routine tasks of healthcare professionals and generate patient-centric insights from large volumes of data to help improve productivity and enhance patient outcomes. In disease diagnosis, AI can enable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to be carried out three times faster than usual to reduce exam time, costs, and increase department productivity – ultimately benefiting patients.In the Philippines, developments in the use of AI in healthcare are already happening. Healthcare providers are utilizing AI to speed up detection of liver cancer and Hepatitis B, while the government has unveiled AI-powered and data-driven solutions for accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.At the European Congress of Radiology (ECR) in March, Philips presented its Al-powered integrated approach across various diagnostic tools including MR, CT, diagnostic X-ray and ultrasound, including next-generation imaging technology that leverages Philips’ state-of-the-art speed engine and an award-winning AI reconstruction technology that boosts speed and image quality. In partnership with (Leiden, The Netherlands), Philips is innovating with AI to improve MR examinations, with the aim to reduce scan times and to reconstruct detailed MR images despite patient or internal organ movement. The approach is already showing promising results in leading hospitals worldwide.“By enhancing the jobs of healthcare workers, AI can help address staff burnout. This can also result in increased staff satisfaction and retention. By supporting healthcare workers, AI has the potential to improve care delivery, patient experiences, and overall health outcomes,” According to Philips’ 2022 Future Health Index, healthcare leaders in APAC are recognizing the opportunities. Across the region, 82% of healthcare leaders predict that AI will become a top investment in the next 3 years.Beyond improving care delivery and workplace efficiencies, AI can also play a role in greening the healthcare industry. It can help predict when maintenance is required by identifying issues before they occur and enable engineers to assess and respond remotely.“AI also supports preventive and virtual care by enabling healthcare workers to monitor and engage patients remotely. Not only can this give more people access to care, but it also lessens travel and CO emissions. According to our 2022 Future Health Index, 1 in 4 APAC healthcare leaders see sustainability practices, such as these, as a top priority today. We at Philips are encouraged by this, as we continue to embed sustainability and circularity in the way we do business and design our solutions,” added As we look to implement more AI into our healthcare system, what’s important to remember is that AI is only as strong as the human experience it supports. Philips is continuously partnering with different healthcare institutions to deliver the right technology that supports staff and provides a better patient care experience. By collaborating with these different organizations, the brand ensures that technologies, such as AI, have a positive impact on the healthcare industry as whole.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/05/25/on-world-thyroid-day-look-out-for-the-symptoms-of-possible-thyroid-ailments/,"On World Thyroid Day, look out for the symptoms of possible thyroid ailments","Approximately one out of eight women are at risk of developing thyroid problems in their lifetime while 1.6 billion people are reportedly at risk of developing thyroid disorders.If you have been experiencing unexplained weight gain, which happens to be one of the most common signs of an underactive thyroid gland, you might have what is known as hypothyroidism. Actresses Bea Alonzo and Ria Atayde recently revealed that they have hypothyroidism which makes it harder for them to lose weight.The other symptoms of this thyroid disease are tiredness, constipation, dry skin and coarse hair, cold intolerance, forgetfulness, and menstrual irregularities. If you have any of these signs or symptoms, it might be time to get your thyroid checked.Today is World Thyroid Day and it is celebrated worldwide to increase awareness and understanding of thyroid disorders, including their signs, causes, and treatments.The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck that produces hormones that affect nearly every organ in your body and control metabolism, weight, breathing, heart rate, and many other functions. Thus, thyroid issues can impact many aspects of your life.Experts however point out that there are other thyroid diseases aside from hypothyroidism. Dr. Patricia Puno-Ramos, an endocrinologist from The Medical City Ortigas, said the most common thyroid diseases in the Philippines are goiter, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroid cancer.Dr. Puno-Ramos explained that goiter is the general term for abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland, it can be non-toxic or toxic and it can be due to thyroid mass or nodules. Non-toxic goiter is the enlargement of thyroid gland with normal thyroid hormone levels while toxic goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland with increased thyroid hormone levels.Goiter including those caused by thyroid mass or nodules can either be benign or cancerous. Symptoms may include a lump in the neck, feeling of tightness in the throat area, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, and neck vein swelling.In contrast to unexplained weight gain, unexpected weight loss could be a sign that your thyroid hormones are too high, also known as hyperthyroidism. The condition is also often called overactive thyroid. Aside from weight loss, its symptoms may include rapid heart rate or palpitations, diarrhea, excessive sweating or heat intolerance, tremors, menstrual irregularities, bulging eyes, and sleep disturbances.Even if you are not experiencing any signs or symptoms of a thyroid disorder, you may still have it.Dr. Puno-Ramos said thyroid diseases can also go unnoticed such as those with subcentimeter thyroid nodules or subclinical hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Subclinical thyroid diseases usually do not present with the usual signs and symptoms of overactive or underactive thyroid and are often discovered only during thyroid hormone level determination through blood test.Dr. Puno-Ramos cited the Philippine Thyroid Diseases Study (PhilTiDes 1) which stated that subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism are the most common thyroid function abnormalities among Filipinos comprising 5.33% and 2.18% of the general population, respectively.Moreover, thyroid nodules are not as easy to identify but catching one early on can help you detect and treat more serious conditions including thyroid cancer. Dr. Puno-Ramos said consult an endocrinologist or check with your doctor to know if you may need to be screened for a thyroid disorder.Dr. Puno-Ramos enumerated the diagnostic exams for patients with thyroid problems that are available at The Medical City Endocrine, Diabetes and Thyroid Center (EDTC). These tests include the following – thyroid function tests (TSH, FT3/T3, FT4/T4), neck or thyroid ultrasound, thyroid scan, fine needle aspiration biopsy, and thyroid antibody testing."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/05/25/living-and-dealing-with-hyperthyroidism/,Living and dealing with hyperthyroidism,"AS more people become aware of common ailments such as hypertension, kidney, liver, heart and other diseases, it seems that health concerns related to the throat may not be attracting too much attention.In fact, even studies related to the throat may already be too outdated already. It was way back in 2012 when a Philippine Thyroid Diseases Study (PhilTiDes-1) was done, which showed the prevalence of thyroid function abnormalities in the country was at 8.53 percent among adults, and among disorders related to the thyroid, goiter is most common with 10.12 percent.THAT butterfly-shaped gland called the thyroid is found in front of the neck. How important is the thyroid gland? This organ regulates the body’s metabolism, temperature, and heart rate, and makes hormones that control how energy in our body is used.The thyroid can be either overactive or underactive. Being underactive, or hypothyroidism, means the thyroid does not make and release enough hormones into the body This in turn slows down metabolism, thereby causing constipation, weight gain and makes a person get tired too quickly.On the flipside, hyperthyroidism or overactive thyroid happens when the thyroid produces too much hormones than what the body needs. This causes rapid weight loss, heart palpitations, and anxiety, having trouble sleeping, increased bowel movements, skin dryness, among other symptoms.Many studies have pointed to iodine deficiency, or low intake of iodine-rich food such as milk, eggs, and seafood, long considered as the top natural source of iodine, as the common culprit for thyroid disorder.In terms of treatment, a thyroidectomy, or surgery that removes a part or even the whole thyroid, can be done. However, this is not performed that much as hyperthyroidism can also be treated effectively through non-invasive methods.IN the case of Vanessa Rue-Macalagay, who has been living with hyperthyroidism since 2015, she felt something was wrong when she suddenly felt so weak that she had difficulty getting out of bed, going to work or doing household chores.“At first I thought it was a heart problem because I was experiencing palpitations and my weight started to drop tremendously. It also had had trouble sleeping and I didn’t have the appetite to eat food that I’d say it was exhausting physically, that my relatives told me to better go see an endocrinologist to check if I have thyroid concerns,” Macalagay narrated.The moment the endocrinologist told her she has hyperthyroidism, Macalagay said the first thing she asked was if it was curable. The doctor responded positively by saying yes, though she had to be very patient. Another question that popped into her mind was if her ailment will prevent her from getting pregnant and have a child even if she was still single at that time. The doctor quickly assured her that she can despite her illness as long as she is able to manage it.And Macalagay was happy that surgery was out of the equation in terms of her treatment since her doctor was not too keen about it and was just told to be patient.“I’m taking oral medications that were adjusted when I got pregnant as my temporary maintenance to manage my hyperthyroidism and hopefully eventually be cured totally. I was informed about undergoing radiation as an option but it also has its risks that I needed to be aware and mindful of,” she said.MACALAGAY said at present, she feels generally fine but still needs to be mindful of her oral medications because without them, she would feel very weak and will again feel the symptoms she experienced before she discovered she had hyperthyroidism. “Overall, I’m able to do the things that I love to do but when it comes to activities that would require physical strength/stamina, I still need to do it with moderation so I don’t experience palpitations.”But what’s really important and valuable to her is the support her family accorded to her in dealing with her situation. She recalled how her then-boyfriend and now husband would accompany her during her regular check-ups with the doctor, and of course her siblings and the rest of her family who were really mindful of her condition.“I think it’s important that aside from family and friends’ support, I also got involved in communities with people who have the same condition as mine. I got to realize how common this condition is and be able to not just get support from them but also encourage others, that our illness is curable and there is hope that we can hold on to,” Macalagay emphasized."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/05/25/smoking-can-trigger-thyroid-problems-expert/,Smoking can trigger thyroid problems–expert,"Thyroid is a gland in your neck that helps regulate various body functions, including your metabolism. One’s lifestyle habits may impact in the function of the thyroid.Likewise, thyroid disorders happen when your thyroid produces insufficient or excessive thyroid hormones.According to Via Medica Journals in Poland, many studies have shown that cigarette smoking exerts multiple effects on the thyroid gland as smoking seems to induce changes in thyroid function tests, like decrease in thyroid stimulating hormone or TSH and increase in thyroid hormones.“However, these alterations are usually mild. In addition, tobacco smoking may also play a role in thyroid autoimmunity,” it read, adding that many studies have confirmed a significant influence of smoking on Graves’ hyperthyroidism and particularly on Graves’ orbitopathy.“Here, smoking may increase the risk of disease development, may reduce the effectiveness of treatment, and eventually induce relapse.”Which is more life-threatening hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism?If left untreated, Dr. Jaime Galvez Tan of HealthJustice Philippines said, both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can lead to serious complications.“How do we protect our thyroid then? Aside from proper diet, clean and healthy environment, and avoiding stress, quitting smoking is also the best thing to do,” Dr. Galvez Tan, who is also a former Health Secretary, said.The body’s production of thyroid hormones, Dr. Galvez Tan said, may be affected by the toxins present in cigarette smoke.“This can cause thyroid problems by interfering with iodine,” Dr. Galvez Tan said as he encouraged those experiencing any unusual symptoms, they should see their physician right away.The Department of Health (DOH), meanwhile, said that thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine-related malignancy in the Philippines. It ranks seventh overall based on the agency’s latest statistics.“Its incidence increases every year, especially in females and in the reproductive age group,” the DOH said.Warning signals for thyroid problems include ahard mass in the anterior neck; nodules of the thyroid in men; rapid enlargement of a long-standing goiter in older patients; cervical lymph node enlargement; hoarseness, difficulty of swallowing, and difficulty of breathing associated with goiter.Early detection can be done through fine needle aspiration biopsy of solitary nodules, or of unusually prominent, hard or rapidly growing nodules in multinodular goiter.“I would also advise that for early detection, ultrasound of the thyroid gland should be included in addition to fine needle biopsy,” Dr. Galvez Tan said.Almost 95 percent of thyroid cancer in the Philippines are well differentiated carcinoma, and are highly curable by appropriate surgery alone.Radioactive iodine is the main mode of treatment for metastatic lesions.Image credits: Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

It may also be noted that the Philippines did not declare its own PHE on the said disease.“However, it is still important to stay alert of its possible resurgence. If you have a travel history to countries with Monkeypox, and then have symptoms like fever, lymphadenopathy or ‘kulani,’ and rashes, seek immediate medical attention. The department also reminds the public that our layers of protection—such as wearing masks, isolating when feeling symptoms, and frequent handwashing—can aid in preventing disease transmission,” the DOH said.The DOH assured that it will remain vigilant and continue to guarantee the public that the Philippines is capable of containing the Monkeypox virus in the country.Monkeypox is an illness caused by the monkeypox virus.It is a viral zoonotic infection, meaning that it can spread from animals to humans. It can also spread from person to person through skin-to-skin contact, including direct contact with the rash, hugging, kissing, or sexual contact.Common symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headaches, muscle pain and back ache, low energy, swollen lymph nodes, and rash with blisters on face, hands, feet, body, eyes, mouth, or genitals.Monkeypox spreads from person to person through close physical contact with someone who has a monkeypox rash, including through face-to-face, skin-to-skin, mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-skin contact.This may include direct contact with the rash, or through hugging, kissing, or sexual contact.WHO said that there is a vaccine recently approved for preventing monkeypox.Some countries are recommending vaccination for persons at risk like someone who has been a close contact of someone who has monkeypox, including health workers.WHO does not recommend mass vaccination against monkeypox at this time.Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted infection. Monkeypox can spread through close contact of any kind such as face-to-face, skin-to-skin, mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-skin, or sexual contact.Anyone with direct contact with a monkeypox rash, even without sexual contact, may be infected with it.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/05/04/lawmaker-says-phl-should-manufacture-own-vaccines-to-ensure-adequate-supply/,Lawmaker says PHL should manufacture own vaccines to ensure adequate supply,"The country must develop its capability to manufacture vaccines to ensure stability and availability in the supply of vaccines for its immunization drive.“The government must seriously look into the consideration to set up manufacturing plants in the Philippines,” said Rep. Anthony Rolando Golez Jr., Vice Chairperson, of the House Committee on Health during the recent “Creating a Disease-Free Society through Immunization” forum organized by the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines Inc. (AMCHAM Philippines) together with Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD) Philippines , and the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines (PHAP).He urged pharmaceutical companies to support this move as it will be a win-win situation for both the government and the private sector.“If you can convince the government by investing in the manufacture of vaccines, you could provide a lot of things such as employment opportunities, payment of taxes. We also have economies of scale, and savings that can enable us to buy more vaccines,” Golez added.He stressed reiterated the call for the private sector to support and help the government’s health program to provide quality services.In response, Golez filed last year House Bill 01710 or “An Act Providing for the Framework for the Establishment and Operation of Virology Laboratories in the Philippines, Creating for the Purpose the Virology Science and Technology Institute of the Philippines [VIP],” Later, House Bill 01710 was substituted by HB06452.At the same time, Golez said the government must also prepare the human resources that will deliver the services to the people. “A steady supply of healthcare workers such as nurses must be guaranteed to be of service to the people,” he said.He urged the government to foster the “Para sa Bayan” spirit manifested through the “Doctors to the Barrio” (DTTB) program. A brainchild of the late former Health Secretary and Senator Juan M. Flavier, the DTTB promoted the deployment of skilled, idealistic and dedicated doctors as rural health physicians to municipalities without doctors.“The other needs of the healthcare workers such as decent pay, housing, schooling and other economic benefits should be addressed,” Golez said.Golez said the Department of Health should also invite healthcare insurance providers to promote medical tourism in the country. He added that the government, together with the private sector, will boost the Universal Health Care program of the government.Dr. Romel Lacson, Country Director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Philippines, said the priority of the Atlanta-based health, science-based and data driven organization is to help the country boost its vaccination campaign. “Immunization is the most cost-effective method to ensure a healthy population,” Lacson said.“For every dollar invested in immunization, the country saves $52,” Lacson added.He said CDC Philippines will continue to partner with the DOH to do constant research in the field epistemology of several diseases in the country.Lacson said the Philippines offers a lot of lessons regarding its vaccination campaign. “We also have the same problems with vaccination in the US,” he said.“We saw the big potential in the vaccination campaign during the Covid-19 pandemic,” Lacson added.He stressed the effectivity of the vaccines made a big difference in the fight against the pandemic resulting in the saving of millions of lives around the world.Image credits: Rizal Raoul S.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/05/04/doh-reminds-women-to-get-themselves-checked-for-cervical-cancer-this-month/,DOH reminds women to get themselves checked for cervical cancer this month,"It is often called the neck of the womb. The cervix, that is.The cervix is part of the female reproductive system located at the junction of the vagina and the uterus (womb).The month of May is Cervical Cancer Awareness month.Cervical cancer is the 2nd leading cancer site among women in the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) said.An estimated 7,277 new cases of, and 3,807 deaths due to, cervical cancer are expected to occur every year.Generally, all women who have had sexual intercourse are at risk of cervix cancer. However, rare types of cervical cancer can occur even in women who never had any sexual intercourse in their life.In recent studies, the DOH said, there has been overwhelming evidence that an infectious agent, particularly human papillomavirus (HPV) that is transmitted through sexual intercourse, causes cancer of the cervix.The following have been established as possible causes of cervix cancer:Generally, cervix cancer does not have symptoms.Often, the disease is detected during its advance stage. However, the following impressions often lead to cervix cancer such as unusual bleeding from the vagina at any time and unpleasant vaginal discharge.Cervical cancer, when detected early, is curable.At present, the most reliable and practical way to diagnose early cervical cancer is through Pap smear.A woman’s first Pap smear should be done three years after the first vaginal intercourse.After that, it should be done every year for three years. If the Pap smear test is negative for the consecutive three years, then it can be done every two or three years.In unmarried women who have never had any sexual activity in their life, Pap smear should be done at age 35.Since there is almost universal acceptance that cervical cancer is primarily transmitted through sexual intercourse, the following preventive measures should be followed:“To mothers and our women, get regular check-ups and get vaccinated against human papillomavirus to prevent cervical cancer,” reminded DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said.Image credits: Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/05/04/wound-care-market-in-phl-shows-bright-potential-study/,Wound care market in PHL shows bright potential—study,"DESPITE the ubiquitous presence of digital devices and the lure of the internet, many kids these days regardless of age and social demographics, would resort to playing outdoors if the opportunity arises. Despite the sun’s immense heat, they will play to their hearts’ content together with their friends or family, whether in the comforts of their homes, the neighborhood streets, parks, all not minding what the mighty sun’s rays can do to their fragile bodies.Same with adults. Not all are glued to their smart phones or laptops, and with many becoming conscious of their health, would choose to go out and do physical activities to make themselves healthy.But just like any physical activity, people are susceptible to possible damage to the body, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality of the US Department of Health and Human Services. These are injuries, which the agency describes as “harm caused by accidents, falls, hits, weapons, and more.”Wounds, on the other hand, are those that “break the skin or other body tissues like cuts, scrapes, scratches, and punctured skin, which often happen because of an accident.” However, it said that surgery, sutures, and stitches also cause wounds, and that “minor wounds usually aren’t serious, but it is important to clean them.” Serious and infected wounds, the agency said, “may require first aid followed by a visit to your doctor. You should also seek attention if the wound is deep, you cannot close it yourself, you cannot stop the bleeding or get the dirt out, or it does not heal.”MOST Filipinos of a certain age, like those born in the late 60s or 70s or probably even earlier, remember two popular topical antiseptics when it comes to treating wounds: “Mercurochrome” and “Merthiolate,” especially wounds on the knees after playing “patintero,” “moro-moro” or even “tumbang preso.” To some, the orange-colored mercurochrome is the mildest, while Merthiolate is the one that would make kids shriek in pain and call all the saints they know from religion class while their mother blows short whiffs of air on the wound to alleviate the pain.To some Filipinos before, wound management involves opening or crushing an antibiotic capsule or tablet and placing the powder directly on the bruised skin. This is a big no-no since they are designed for oral ingestion and not for topical application.But there are those who are a bit more logical in thinking when it comes to wound care. For them, water is still the top choice for initial wound management. Just make sure that the water source is not highly pressurized so a running water faucet would suffice. Soap, a mild soap with less harmful chemicals, is also effective but just make sure to wash the wound thoroughly so there would no excess soap left on the wound itself.In the provinces, there are village folk who still believe in the power of certain indigenous herbs and common kitchen implements to treat common wounds and even body ailments, and these are already being studied heavily by the Department of Health for their efficacy.ACCORDING to the Wound Care Market– Philippines Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030, a study that provided a wound care market overview of the Philippines, in 2017, the Philippine wound care market size was at around US$51 million. However, the study revealed that this is projected to reach a higher US$85 million come year 2025 or about two years from now and growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 6.5 percent from 2018 to 2025.The study revealed that the country’s wound care market will continue to expand even further because of what it pointed out as “rapidly aging population and favorable demographics; rise in incidence of diabetes, obesity, and chronic conditions; and technological advancements to deal with complex wounds.”It said that the country’s wound care market is segmented into three parts: advanced wound care, surgical wound care, and traditional/basic wound care, with surgical wound care expected to broaden in size during the said forecast period. This is due to the foreseen growth in the amount of surgical procedures and demand for more cutting-edge technologies in surgical procedures such as “minimally invasive surgeries and laparoscopic surgeries.”More opportunities will also present itself to wound care market players with the presence of an aging population who are more vulnerable to certain medical conditions and would need top-quality wound care products that are proven effective and efficient in treating wounds and enable faster healing.Image credits:"

And the other thing is that in terms of the number of diagnostic machines available, the Philippines is ranked 126th out of 140 countries globally,” she told the in a sideline interview during the launch of their latest facility last April 26.This growth opportunity made them decide to put up such a pioneering one-stop-shop facility of its kind in the country, according to her.Without divulging their exact amount of investment, the top executive only said that it’s “quite big” given their provision of services centered on diagnostic testing and preventive care, as well as extensive and all-in medical checkup and screening services to all clients of all ages.SEATED on the 8th and 23rd floors of Ore Central Building at the Bonifacio Global City in Taguig, Shinagawa Diagnostic and Preventive Care Center offers brain diagnostic exams (MRI/MRA), full body exams (CT scan), digestive scans (ultrasound and endoscopy), and tests for women (mammography and ultrasound), among other customizable screenings.When patients visit the center, medical check-ups are done with ease and convenience sans waiting time, from booking to undergoing procedures and claiming results, all in the same day courtesy of the Japanese Health Checkup Information System, which increases operational efficiency.Shinagawa, likewise, practices double reading and consultation with Japanese medical experts to ensure high precision of diagnosis and treatment plans.Eumori bared that they are in the process of obtaining accreditation with all major Health Maintenance Organization providers nationwide to make its services more convenient and accessible to all Filipinos.AS a headstart, she said that they are targeting to tap corporate accounts, not only for the basic but also executive checkups of their employees.While the center conforms to high Japanese healthcare standards, available service packages are affordable, starting at P5,000.With this in mind, Shinagawa Diagnostic and Preventive Care Center is expected to accommodate at least 150 patients a day, per Uemori.Shinagawa continuously hires medical doctors, including OB gyne and radiologists. Expansion-wise, the company will still focus in Metro Manila.“With our globally competitive medical experts and state of the art technology, we can assure of giving you only the best healthcare services,” she stressed. “Early detection of illnesses allows patients more time to seek effective medicines or procedures that can ultimately lessen or cure their symptoms.”Roderick L.

We recognize the efforts of the DOH and partners to bring renewed energy to accelerate catch up and prevent future outbreaks. Covid-19 has shown us that collective and concerted action works. We must exercise that same vigor for children’s immunization to make sure that children in the Philippines do not get left behind,” said UNICEF Philippines Representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov during the launch of “Chikiting Ligtas 2023: Join the Big Catch Up, Magpabakuna para sa Healthy Pilipinas!”According to UNICEF, around 67 million children globally missed out entirely or partially on routine immunization between 2019 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This ranks the Philippines second to the highest number of children with zero doses in East Asia and the Pacific Region, and fourth in the world.UNICEF’s flagship publication also revealed the sharp decline in public perception in the Philippines of the importance of vaccines for children, decreasing by 25 percent and registering one of the steepest declines from 55 countries studied.For the Chikiting Ligtas campaign, DOH said it is mobilizing the full weight of its financial and human resources, allocating funds for Centers for Health Development’s hiring of vaccinators, risk communications and advocacy activities, and delivery of vaccines and other supplies. This support will also extend to routine vaccinations until the end of the year.As an aid to the campaign, the WHO and UNICEF support the DOH by providing assistance in procuring vaccines, deploying additional health staff, engaging with communities to address hesitancy and misinformation, and building cold chain capacities, among others.“We must act now to protect every child in the Philippines from vaccine-preventable diseases. The Immunization Agenda 2030 and the Big Catch-up present a unique opportunity to catch up on missed vaccinations and strengthen our immunization systems for future generations. We fully support the Department of Health’s Chikiting Ligtas campaign and its supplemental immunization activities,” said Dr. Rui Paulo de Jesus, WHO Representative to the Philippines.“Let us work together to ensure that no child is left behind and that every child in the Philippines has access to life-saving vaccines. Our appeal to families: your children’s health is too precious to leave to chance. Vaccines are free, safe, and effective in keeping them healthy. By keeping up to date with vaccines, you are giving your children a shot at a brighter future,” he added.For her part, DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said that one of the department’s “evergreen goals” is to protect Filipino children from preventable diseases and those include measles, rubella, and polio.“As a measure to provide them protection, we shall continue to prioritize vaccination through programs such as Chikiting Ligtas 2023: Join the Big Catch Up, Magpabakuna para sa Healthy Pilipinas! to reach our young Juan and Juanas anywhere in the country,” she said.The campaign, she said, is also a time to renew public trust in the value of all vaccines and continue to build long-term support and awareness for immunization, as vaccines have proven to be critical in containing or limiting outbreaks of infectious diseases.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

OMRON Healthcare, a global leader in trusted and innovative medical equipment and a staunch advocate of better heart health for Filipinos, has announced the clinical validation of two of its automatic blood pressure monitors: the HEM-7120 and HEM-7121. The validation, which is conferred by the Philippine Society of Hypertension (PSH), confirms the quality and accuracy of OMRON Healthcare devices.When looking for a home blood pressure monitoring device, it is important to choose one that is validated by hypertension experts to guarantee accurate and reliable measurements at home. A clinical validation is also a hallmark of a trusted brand preferred by doctors.Getting validated is no small feat, however. The validation of automated blood pressure devices follows a standard procedure and criteria and requires a blood pressure study involving more than 200 participants.OMRON Healthcare is the only brand in the country with PSH-validated devices that are proven capable of providing accurate and precise blood pressure readings.“It is important that experts and health organizations such as the Philippine Society of Hypertension guide consumers to only use blood pressure monitoring devices that have been validated under an internationally accepted standard. At the end of the day, the goal is not just to make our jobs as healthcare providers easier but to accurately give proper care to patients and thus save more lives,” said former PSH President Dr. Leilani B. Mercado-Asis.Dr. Dolores Bonzon, the current president of PSH, also highlighted the importance of a reliable BPM for health monitoring. “Our hope is that every Filipino will make it a practice to monitor their blood pressure and heart health, not only in a medical setting but even in their own homes. For at-home blood pressure monitoring to be effective, we recommend to our patients to use validated devices such as OMRON’s automated blood pressure monitors.”“We are honored that OMRON devices can serve as a partner for healthcare professionals in uplifting Filipinos’ health. In addition to being a trusted provider of quality medical equipment, OMRON has strong advocacy for improving lives,” said OMRON Asia Pacific Pte Ltd Philippine Branch (Healthcare Division) General Manager Yusuke Kato.Aside from being clinically validated, the HEM-7120 and HEM-7121 are equipped with state-of-the-art features designed to make at-home blood pressure monitoring as easy as possible for Filipinos.Both models have a Cuff Wrapping Guide to help the user fit the arm cuff correctly to ensure an accurate and reliable blood pressure measurement. The built-in Hypertension Indicator gives off a signal if the measured systolic or diastolic pressure is outside the standard range. The products are designed with OMRON’s intuitive IntelliSense Technology, which automatically inflates the cuff to the ideal level to deliver accurate measurements with comfort and ease. This feature is especially useful in obtaining accurate readings in cases of fluctuations in blood pressure.The HEM-7120 and HEM-7121 are the latest OMRON blood pressure monitoring devices to join the brand’s list of clinically validated and trusted devices, which includes trusted models such as the HEM-7130 and JPN1. To guarantee the accuracy of its monitoring devices, OMRON undergoes a validation process with PSH every two years.“Our commitment has always been to provide the Filipino people with accessible and reliable health monitoring devices and to support initiatives that advocate improved healthcare and quality of life. The clinical validation of our devices is an invaluable process for us in ensuring our products serve our mission of cultivating a healthy heart for every Filipino,” added Yusuke Kato.OMRON Healthcare likewise supports the annual May Measurement Month, which aims to raise awareness of the prevalence of hypertension across the world and is also a partner of the International Society of Hypertension since 2017.OMRON Healthcare devices are available in Mercury Drug, Watsons, Southstar Drug, Rose Pharmacy and other leading pharmacies nationwide and in OMRON’s flagship Shopee and Lazada stores."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/04/27/johnson-johnson-visions-contact-lens-brand-acuvue-now-available-in-phl/,"Johnson & Johnson Vision’s contact lens brand ACUVUE, now available in PHL","Johnson & Johnson Vision, a global leader in eye health and part of Johnson & Johnson MedTech, recently announced the launch of 1-DAY ACUVUE® MOIST and 1-DAY ACUVUE® DEFINE® contact lenses in the Philippines.Vision, the most dominant of our senses, is vital at every turn of our lives. It’s how we experience the world. Yet, many people often neglect the single most important step to protect their eyes—getting an eye exam. According to a survey conducted by Hello Doctor, eye care was found to be low on the priorities of Filipinos with 26 percent not remembering the last time they had an eye exam.At Johnson & Johnson Vision, we are united in our aspiration to partner with eye care professionals to change the trajectory of eye health. Johnson & Johnson Vision has been at the forefront, leading with research, science, and technology to deliver the best outcomes for patients across a lifetime of eye health needs through world-class innovation and customer experience.Now available in the Philippines, the 1-DAY ACUVUE® MOIST contact lens made with LACREON® Technology, is designed to keep moisture in and irritation out to provide an excellent safety profile and long-lasting cushion of moisture for up to 20 hours or more. Supporting this technology includes several eye-inspired innovations that give people the confidence and reassurance to wear contact lenses, specifically: class 2 UV blocking to help protect from the transmission of harmful UV radiation to the cornea and into the eye and invisible edge design which are thin-edged lenses that adhere to the shape of the eye so that the eyelids glide over them as if nothing is there.The 1-DAY ACUVUE® DEFINE® contact lens, which includes the same LACREON® Technology is also available in the Philippines. The 1-DAY ACUVUE® DEFINE® contact lens comes in different colors and designs to enhance one’s natural eye beauty.In a recent study on contact lenses conducted by Johnson & Johnson Vision, it was found that Millennials and Gen Zs believe that having good eye health is essential to their lifestyle; mainly because their career aspirations and goals in life require them to have good vision. For some, wearing spectacles have hindered them from enjoying activities such as sports, traveling, and expressing their unique style at social gatherings, but they may not be motivated to try contact lenses due to common myths they have heard.This is what Johnson & Johnson Vision aims to address as they launch the 1-DAY ACUVUE® MOIST and the 1-DAY ACUVUE® DEFINE® contact lenses here in the Philippines.“Filipinos today are hustlers and achievers in all aspects, however their apprehension around using contact lenses prohibits them from seizing and owning their moments. The 1-DAY ACUVUE® MOIST contact lens brings a solution to consumers who have been looking for clear and comfortable vision with daily disposable contacts,” said Jhoanna Marie Tismo, Brand Manager, Vision Care, Johnson & Johnson Vision.“1-DAY ACUVUE® MOIST is an iconic product. The addition of LACREON® technology, with long-lasting moisture embedded inside the lens, provides a solution for the most frequently reported complaints of contact lens discomfort—dryness. On top of that, it provides protection against harmful UVA and UVB radiation, giving consumers the freedom and flexibility to enjoy outdoor activities,” she concluded.Adding to this insight, we spoke to eye care professionals, Dr. Ji Gonzales of Eyeboxx, Dr. Eldeen Baluso of Global Eyecare, Dr. Leanne Jeanne Encarnacion of Eye Gallery Optical Clinic Co., and Dr. Liz Cua of George Optical, about contact lenses and what new contact lens wearers need to be aware of.And as advised by these eye experts, one should first go through an eye assessment so that they can properly prescribe patients the best contact lenses fit for their needs. From there, the contact lenses should have quality comfort, convenience, and ease of insert and removal—and most likely, should be disposable as well in order to lessen the risk of eye infections.“I believe that every contact lens wearer needs to be assessed thoroughly and managed individually; meaning they have to go through a complete and comprehensive eye assessment for them to be prescribed a specific contact lens for their individual needs,” said Dr. Leanne Jeanne. “With disposable lenses, patients wearing them may benefit from enjoying their daily activities with good vision while making sure that their eyes are fully safe,” she assured.To find an eye care professional and schedule an appointment to try ACUVUE® contact lenses, visit .

As the 100 percent Filipino-owned company celebrates its 65th year, PHILUSA looks to carve new meaning in its positioning as “Katuwang ng Bawat Tahanang Pilipino.”PHILUSA released on social media a two-part video series highlighting the company’s partnerships with like-minded organizations that advocate for clean water access and the reduction of ocean-bound plastic waste.“The goal of PHILUSA is to raise awareness about sustainable sanitation and proper hygiene practices and how to properly look after our environment,” says Neogin Evangelista, PHILUSA Corporation President and General Manager. “We want to empower and encourage Filipino households in bringing about positive change and making the world a safer and cleaner home for all of us.”The first video, titled “Katuwang sa Kalinisan,” follows PHILUSA’S efforts in promoting basic access to clean water, in partnership with Manila Water Foundation (MWF). Data reveal that 50.3 million Filipinos still do not have access to water sanitation facilities and services as of 2020.To address this pressing issue, MWF launched “WASH: Water Access, Sanitation, and Hygiene,” a program that promotes health and sanitation in marginalized communities. PHILUSA joins MWF in its mission to improve access to clean and potable water, as well as the promotion of proper hygiene practices in communities. PHILUSA also partners with MWF in the observance of other related programs, including Global Handwashing Day, World Toilet Day, and World Oral Health Day.Meanwhile, the second video, titled “Katuwang sa Kalikasan,” narrates the efforts of PHILUSA in helping save the environment. According to studies, the Philippines ranks as the 3rd largest contributor of marine plastic waste.In its bid to reduce ocean-bound plastic waste, PHILUSA joined hands with the Canada-based social enterprise Plastic Bank. The organization is committed to getting rid of ocean plastic while helping improve the lives of plastic collectors. In just a year, Philusa and Plastic Bank collected 2.5 million plastic bottles, preventing them from entering the ocean.“Besides the goals of these two programs, Philusa wants to convey the message that the fight to save the environment continues,” says Maya Leander, PHILUSA Corporation Marketing Head. “We hope every Filipino household joins us in our continuing mission to take care of our environment and everyone else.”"

The country was declared wild polio-free again in 2021.Vergeire said that the DOH will intensify their immunization campaign against polio and other diseases.“First and foremost for polio, we already closed this outbreak and we do not want to reopen this again,” Vergeire said.Poliomyelitis or polio is a highly contagious viral disease caused by three types of poliovirus (types 1,2 and 3).The disease can result in irreversible paralysis affecting most commonly the leg muscles but for five to 10 percent of acute flaccid paralysis cases, the breathing muscles are also affected which can cause death.Aside from vaccination, Vergeire said that the DOH continuously conducts waste water monitoring surveillance in high-risk areas as part of its prevention and control measures.Children under the age of five are most vulnerable to contracting polio.In the Philippines, children under one year old receive their primary doses of the polio vaccines during routine immunization—three doses of polio drops and one dose of inactivated polio vaccine.The DOH is also set to conduct nationwide supplemental immunization in May to prevent measles.“As of March of this year we already have 225 cases of measles in the country,” Vergeire said.She added that they observed some clustering of infection in some areas.“We still couldn’t say it’s an outbreak as of now but it might be and it might continue to become an outbreak if we can’t stop it,” she said.Measles is a very serious disease. It is caused by a virus and spreads very easily when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes.Measles spreads so easily that someone who is not protected (either by being immunized or having had measles in the past) can get it if they walk into a room where someone with the disease has been in the past couple of hours.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/04/27/concern-raised-over-decline-in-childhood-vaccination/,Concern raised over decline in childhood vaccination,"HOW important are vaccines to children? Unfortunately, a lot of kids around the world are missing out on their vaccination due to several factors.According to the State of the World’s Children 2023 report, it warned that a total of 67 million children missed out entirely or partially on their routine immunizations between 2019 and 2022, while vaccination coverage levels dipped in 112 countries.Of this number, a huge 48 million went “zero dose,” which means that they did not receive a single routine vaccine.Here in the Philippines, about 1 million children went “zero dose,” the second highest in the East Asia and Pacific region, and fifth highest in the world.ALSO, the Vaccine Confidence Project of the UNICEF bared that the perception of the importance of vaccines for children went down by about 25 percent in the Philippines, and more than a third in Korea, Papua New Guinea, Ghana, Senegal and Japan after the start of the pandemic. In contrast, data in countries such as China, India, and Mexico showed that perception on vaccine importance stayed firm or even improved.Despite the alarming numbers, overall support for vaccines remained relatively strong. Almost half of the 55 countries showed that more than 80 percent of the respondents saw vaccines as important for children.However, there are many factors that may still contribute to vaccine hesitancy, such as uncertainty about the response to the pandemic, fake news or misleading information, eroding trust in expertise, and political polarization. In the Philippines, vaccine hesitancy can be attributed to cultural factors, and concerns on vaccine safety.“At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, scientists rapidly developed Covid-19 vaccines that saved countless lives. But despite this historic achievement, fear, and disinformation about all types of vaccines circulated as widely as the virus itself,” said Catherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director. “This data is a worrying warning signal. We cannot allow confidence in routine immunizations to become another victim of the pandemic. Otherwise, the next wave of deaths could be of more children with measles, diphtheria, or other preventable diseases.”Admittedly, the decline in confidence was fueled by the pandemic where childhood vaccination was halted almost everywhere, immunization resources were diverted to Covid-19 vaccination, the shortage of health workers, and the various lockdowns and community quarantines.Thus, the UNICEF is calling on governments to double-down on their commitment to increase financing for immunization. The agency is also urging governments to work with stakeholders to tap available resources, including leftover pandemic funds, to put in place and accelerate catch-up vaccination efforts to protect children and prevent disease outbreaks.FOR Kathleen Solis, UNICEF Philippines Social and Behavior Change Specialist, she believes this is where conversations and engagements will be useful. She said it’s not enough to just tell people or parents what they need to do. “We also need to explain why and then we listen to their issues and concerns, respond properly to their questions in a way that manages their fears and concerns. It’s not really bad when parents ask questions. We want it because it’s also an entry point for us to explain, build and strengthen trust in the healthcare system and trust in the vaccines.”UNICEF Philippines Communications Officer Marge Francia echoed this, citing what they learned during UNICEF Philippines’ polio campaign in 2019 in terms of countering religious and cultural beliefs. She said that when they were doing the campaign in Bangsa Moro, they gathered, talked to and engaged with religious leaders, one of the most influential people there. “We asked them what the Qur’an says about vaccination. From that discussion we had many sermons that were derived from the teaching of the Qur’an and related to keeping children healthy for them to have a bright future by taking care of their health needs. Those have been very effective and we think that’s one of the things we have done successfully with our partners on the ground.”WITH regard to politics, Carla Orozco, UNICEF Philippines’ Immunization Specialist, said politics or eliminating it in the country is not possible, especially now that the healthcare services delivery system is devolved to the local government units.She said it’s really the governors, the mayors, the barangay captains who have the say, especially on the budget for health, even human resources so they are really an integral part in the delivery of immunization services. “It’s not really eliminating politics; it’s about providing them the right information on the urgency of the situation, and that is the importance of vaccination. Once you provide information and they understand what their roles are, then they become allies in the provision of immunization services and other healthcare services as well. I think it’s very important that more political will is advocated. It will be like accountability on their part to their constituents. As they say, good health is good politics.”Francia reiterated that for UNICEF, their concern is the best interest of the child so they work with different sectors of society. “It’s about the rights of children. That is what we try to get through in our discussions with political leaders. We believe that a healthy population will deliver progress for the Philippines in the future, become leaders of tomorrow. If these children are not healthy, not educated and not able to reach their full potential, what future do we hold for our country? I think that’s an important point to get across.”Image credits:"

TMC Ortigas bagged Healthcare Asia’s Hospital of the Year award two years in a row as well as the Marketing Initiative of the Year award. TMC Clinic won Primary Care Provider of the Year while TMC South Luzon received its second ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) Program of the Year award.The Medical City (TMC) is currently the largest healthcare network in the country with one main facility in Ortigas, Pasig City, four provincial hospitals, and over 50 clinics in Metro Manila and select provinces, all operating under a single brand.These recent recognitions signify the TMC enterprise’s ongoing commitment to sustain healthcare leadership through its exceptional quality of care and unparalleled leadership in research and innovation.Healthcare is one of the most rapidly changing industries as new data and strategies emerge from time to time. The TMC enterprise is rising to the challenge as its leaders and medical experts relentlessly pursue quality and safety practices, improved care delivery, and better ways to heal and help patients.While he is grateful to the award-giving bodies for the accolades, TMC enterprise President and CEO Dr. Eugenio Jose F. Ramos says TMC’s continuous improvements and advancements are for the people and community it serves.“For the past few years, The Medical City hospitals have been receiving awards from Healthcare Asia and other organizations. Like what I always say, we did not embark on this journey toward health care leadership for the sake of the accolades. It was never about the award or the recognition. It was about practicing excellence and compassionate care every day for the people we serve. It was about helping the country’s health care system improve for the benefit of the people,” says Dr. Ramos.This is TMC Ortigas’ third Hospital of the Year award, with the first and second awards given in 2020 and 2022 respectively.In mid-2022, TMC Ortigas launched its #EveryBeatMatters campaign to promote cardiovascular services through a combination of original music, video, and graphic material.The music tracks used in the campaign featured BPM (beats per minute) ranging from approximately 150 bpm to 100 bpm to 50 bpm, representing the actual BPM ranges depicting a fetus’ heartbeat during sonograms, an average person’s heartbeat at the high end of normal range or the recommended for CPR, and an average person’s heartbeat at rest.This novel use of original music helped TMC engage its audiences with both commercial and medically accurate audio-visual content. It likewise provided TMC cardiovascular services its own brand through original music, for use in marketing, patient education, and service delivery not just for TMC Ortigas but for the rest of the enterprise hospitals.TMC Clinic operates over 50 ambulatory clinics in Metro Manila and in select provinces and offers a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.Even during the global pandemic, TMC Clinic continued to grow and maintain a total of 52 conveniently located fully-operational clinics equipped with the most sophisticated air safety and purifying systems. That the clinics were positioned as non-covid facilities conveyed equal importance given to all health and medical care concerns.Going beyond the basic requirement of organized primary care facilities, TMC Clinic made multi-specialty care even more accessible to patients, addressing the distinct health-seeking behavior of Filipinos in the community and corporate levels. Each clinic is strongly supported by selected specialists—Family Medicine and Internal Medicine—to deliver primary care coordination, and other specialists and subspecialists for coordinated care referrals and follow-up of patients.Over the past two years, while working to further strengthen the organization, TMC Clinic had also worked to expand its specialized medical care in the ambulatory care setting, including several services in select clinics. These services include Hemodialysis, Ambulatory Surgery (Minor cases), Rehabilitation Medicine and Physical Therapy, Endoscopy, Cardiac Rehab, Sleep Laboratory, Women’s Health, Mental Health, Bone and Joint Clinic, and Corporate Clinic, more popularly known as clinic management services in companies.Every year to commemorate World AIDS Day, TMC South Luzon conducts lectures and offers free HIV screenings to its employees and patients. In 2021, TMC South Luzon established the Center for Reproductive Health and STI Treatment (CREST) in its pursuit to turn the advocacy into a larger scale. CREST is a DOH-accredited facility where linkages, diagnosis, treatment, and continuum of care and support for people with HIV are provided.To launch and promote the center and its advocacy, TMCSL held a fundraising event dubbed “Red Mask Gala: Runway for a Cause” on December 1, 2021 at The Monochrome Nuvali, Santa Rosa City, Laguna.For its first year, the event featured 50 doctors, employees, and guests who walked the runway wearing their best outfits and the “red masks” that were custom made for the donors. The funds raised benefited two foundations—Project Ribbon’s Duyan: Cradling for Children with HIV and TMC South Luzon’s Young Adult Care Assistance Program (YACAP).In its second year, the theme of the event was Filipiniana and it was titled “Red Gala: Unmasked” to refer to the easing and lifting of some Covid-19 protocols.TMCSL’s Chief Operating Officer Dr. Jose Enrico Juliano described the fund-raising activity as the hospital’s “small contribution” with artistic expression, while rekindling awareness and advancing progress on HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care in the country."

When completed in December 2024, the facility will be able to house up to 2,000 hospital personnel and will have a cafeteria, fitness center and multi-purpose hall.In an interview with BusinessMirror, Dr. Arturo De La Pena, SLMC’s President and CEO, said the facility, which will be constructed a stone’s throw away from St. Luke’s Medical Center Global City, is part of the hospital’s investment in their people, noting that renting an apartment or a room in the vicitinty is quite expensive.“The facility will be known as the St. Luke’s Medical Center Off-Site Support Facility and this will be a first of its kind facility. This is our way of helping to improve the living facilities of our employees so that they will be inspired to work. Our employees will only have to pay a minimal fee as this will be subsidized by the hospital,” said Dr. De La Pena.He added that the hospital will also be transferring non-patient rooms like the warehouse to this facility so that the hospital will be able to free up more rooms for patients.“We will also be setting aside rooms for the relatives of patients who need to be close by to look after their patients,” he added.The off-site facility is expected to be operational by December 2024.Officials from St. Luke’s Medical Center, Design Coordinates, John Ryan Santos, ARUP, Quality Solutions and Thaison Builder and Developer were present during the the 1st Concrete Pouring Ceremony for the St. Luke’s Medical Center Off-Site Support Facility."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/04/27/sm-foundation-watsons-join-hands-for-a-medical-mission-in-ilocos-norte/,"SM Foundation, Watsons join hands for a medical mission in Ilocos Norte","SM Foundation Inc. (SMFI) and Watsons recently teamed up to promote the health and wellness of Filipinos through a series of medical missions in Ilocos Norte.With the support of project partners, the two organizations conducted two successful medical missions that brought free diagnostic and medical services to thousands of beneficiaries.During the first leg of the medical mission in the coastal municipality of Currimao, SMFI, Watsons, and DMIRIE Foundation extended free diagnostic and medical services to over 500 beneficiaries.Following the success of the first mission, the second health caravan was held in Laoag City. Over 1,800 beneficiaries were provided with free medicines, vitamins, and medical services, including medical consultations, skincare tests, hair analyses, sugar tests, audiometry tests, cholesterol tests, and uric acid tests.SMFI also dispatched its mobile clinic, which provided ECGs and X-ray tests.The recently concluded medical missions are just some of the many ways that SMFI and Watsons are working to improve the health and wellness of Filipinos. As they continue to collaborate with volunteers, project partners and local government units, they are committed to bringing more medical missions and other initiatives to make a positive impact on the lives of thousands of Filipinos in need.Watsons began its medical missions in 2013, providing free medical consultation, laboratory tests, and medicines to the beneficiaries. It has also forged a partnership with Operation Smile and conducts free cleft and palate surgeries for Filipino children. Watsons is part of the Health and Beauty Store chain of A.S. Watson, one of the largest health, beauty, cosmetics, and perfumery retailers.Meanwhile, through its health and medical programs, SM Foundation upgrades public health centers in its host communities, complemented by its medical caravans across the country. To date, it has renovated more than 170 health and wellness centers and served more than 1 million patients during its medical missions."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/04/27/wolvit-offers-proactive-steps-against-early-hair-loss-in-new-digital-ad-campaign/,Wolvit offers proactive steps against early hair loss in new digital ad campaign,"Discovering the signs of early hair loss can be one of the most stressful parts of adulthood. It’s not only a signal of aging, but potentially a sign of other issues with the body that need addressing. This is the scenario that biotin supplement Wolvit has highlighted in their two newest digital ads.The first of the videos, “Night Out,” shows two young men hanging out at a restaurant. When one finds a hair strand in his food and goes to complain, he comes to the unfortunate realization that it is his own hair that has been shedding into the food.Meanwhile, in the video “Hinala,” a married woman becomes suspicious that her husband is having an affair when she finds loose hair on his clothes. When she wakes up to find her pillow covered in loose hair, she realizes that she’s the source and not some mystery woman.Marco Elmer Manus, Group Product Manager at Kusum Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. Brand Office, spoke about how the recent digital ads capture the experience many people have. “When people start to lose their hair, it can be quite a shock. If you don’t know what’s happening to your body, it can lead to a loss of confidence,” said Manus. “That’s why we want everyone to know that it could be a sign of biotin deficiency. This isn’t something many people look out for, and it’s a problem that can be solved.”Biotin is used by the body to produce important proteins like keratin. The body needs keratin to maintain healthy hair, skin, and nails. Studies have found that those suffering from biotin deficiency often experience symptoms that could include excessive premature hair loss, brittle nails, and dried out skin.Manus reminds everyone that the more one understands a problem, the better equipped one is to solve it. “When your body is giving you signs, you shouldn’t ignore it. If you’re suffering from biotin deficiency, it’s important to act immediately. Exercise, eat well, and take Wolvit.”Wolvit works by giving the body the biotin it needs to produce healthy hair, skin, and nails. A recent clinical study conducted in Ukraine found that the use of Wolvit has a positive effect on one’s skin, hair, and nails. This makes it ideal for those suffering from biotin deficiency and its various symptoms. Another study published in Skin Appendage Disorders, also found that cases where biotin was used to combat hair loss showed evidence of clinical improvement.Wolvit is now available for purchase in drugstores Watsons and Mercury Drug nationwide."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/04/27/people-living-with-hiv-in-phl-to-double-by-2030/,People living with HIV in PHL to double by 2030,"The number of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) nationwide is expected to double this year, reaching 364,000 cases.In a recent media forum, Department of Health National HIV Surveillance Officer Noel Palaypayon said a downward trend in the number of HIV infections was observed worldwide but is on the rise in the Philippines.“We have already seen a 30 percent decrease in annual infections between 2010 and 2021, looking at the global scale. In 2021, based on HIV global data, there are 38.4 million PLHIVs, 1.5 million were newly infected, and 650,000 have died from AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]-related illnesses,” he said.In the same year, the country logged 21,400 individuals newly infected with HIV, which is a 327-percent increase in annual infections between 2010 and 2021.“The new infections are projected to continuously increase in the next years. The estimated PLHIVs in the Philippines could reach 364,000 by 2030 which is a two-fold increase from the estimated PLHIV by the end of 2022,” he said.From 1983 to February 2023, a total of 112,028 HIV cases were recorded nationwide.The average of newly-diagnosed cases per day increased to 47 this year from nine infections daily in 2012.“Looking into the trend of infections, nearly half of the new infections [are from the youth] aged 15 to 24 years old,» he said.The DOH’s latest data registry showed a 16-percent increase in cases among teenagers aged 15 to 19 and a 30-percent increase among young adults aged 20 to 24.Palaypayon emphasized the HIV epidemic in the country is concentrated on the key and vulnerable populations—men having sex with men, transgender women, female sex workers, people who inject with drugs, young population, and women and children.He said the cycle of HIV transmission could be ended if the key and vulnerable populations have access to preventive services and are practicing protective behavior.PLHIVs must be diagnosed and placed under antiretroviral therapy, he added.Earlier, DOH officer-in-charge Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said both HIV testing and treatment are offered for free at local government units. The DOH and the Philippine National AIDS Council have developed action plans to address the high number of HIV cases, harmonized with the previously developed 7th AIDS Medium Term Plan that highlights the five strategic pillars of the master plan: Prevent, Treat, Protect, Strengthen and Sustain."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/04/27/financial-costs-stigma-are-top-reasons-why-pinoys-wont-seek-mental-health-care-study/,"Financial costs, stigma are top reasons why Pinoys won’t seek mental health care—study","THERE was a time when seeking mental health care was practically taboo among Filipinos. In fact, many of them cringe at the simple thought of going to a professional, a psychiatrist or psychologist, to seek medical help for fear of being branded by neighbors and society in general as a “loonie” or “nut case.”It’s like having one’s own version of the scarlet letter, a mark that will forever be etched in one’s humanity.But some changes are happening and the Covid-19 pandemic may have had something to do with it. Admittedly, mental health concerns rose at the height of this globally devastating pandemic, primarily due to the long community quarantines and lockdowns that forced millions to stay at home to avoid catching the deadly virus.IN a study based on a survey conducted among local mental health and psychosocial support (MPHSS) providers by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative (HHI) Resilient Communities program, in cooperation with the Philippine Psychiatric Association (PPA) and the Psychological Association of the Philippines (PAP), majority of the respondents, or about 97.9 percent, said they saw an uptick in mental health concerns in the help-seeking population in the Philippines since the pandemic hit.Among these concerns, anxiety topped the list at 97.9 percent, followed by depressive disorders at 97.2 percent. The other concerns were bipolar and related disorders at 49 percent, trauma-related disorders at 46.2 percent, and the list was capped by suicide risk behaviors such as ideas of suicide (suicidal ideation) and suicide attempts at 44.1 percent.However, the study showed that increases in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders at 24.8 percent, substance-related and addictive disorders at 16.6 percent, and obsessive-compulsive-related disorders at 13.1 percent were less frequently reported.AMONG the study’s highlights, however, was that it pointed to affordability and stigma as among the major reasons that bar Filipinos from seeking mental health care.The study revealed that 40 percent of the respondents cited high financial costs of mental health care as the top barrier, while the other leading hindrances to seeking mental health care were related to stigma. About 35.9 percent noted the feeling of embarrassment or being ashamed, 31 percent pointed to the concern of being seen as “crazy,” while 30.3 percent cited weakness, concerns about family at 23.4 percent, and other people’s reactions at 22.1 percent.However, a big number among the respondents, or about 65 percent, said that barriers to access and treatment stigma have decreased since the advent of Covid-19. Around 62.6 percent stressed that the transition to “teletherapy” or medical consultations done online, ensured care continuity, according to the study, and in some cases, the expansion of services and service areas were observed as the switch to teletherapy happened.“These study findings are promising in that they suggest that in the face of widespread challenges posed by pandemics or disasters there is a reduction in stigma related to seeking mental health care. Further, greater accessibility to mental health care services through telehealth create opportunities for providing care for those that may not otherwise seek support because of distance, travel costs, or other similar barriers,” according to Dr. Vincenzo Bollettino, Program Director of the HHI Resilient Communities.THE respondents were one in saying that enhancing the delivery of mental health services in the Philippines is very much needed. About 82.5 percent of them recommended more training for mental health providers or staff, 75.5 percent called for more mental health service providers, 72 percent said better internet connectivity is also needed, while 69.9 percent wanted a boost in government funding for mental health, and 66.4 percent called for an increase in raising awareness for services in order to better reach communities that are in need.# # #"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/04/27/asian-hospital-keeps-its-promise-to-excellence/,Asian Hospital keeps its promise to excellence,"Founded on a vision to provide Filipinos with top notch medical service that is at par with international standards, Asian Hospital and Medical Center (AHMC) continues to keep its promise to excellence by winning Healthcare Asia’s Patient Care Initiative of the Year (Philippines) and Clinical Service Initiative of the Year (Philippines).The Healthcare Asia Awards 2023 lauded the trailblazing initiatives in healthcare that made a remarkable impact amidst the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Healthcare providers need to constantly innovate and reinvent, especially now as the world begins recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic.The healthcare companies that stood out were those who were able to provide quality care to patients and make significant strides in the industry whilst navigating these challenges.The Healthcare Asia Awards program aims to recognize healthcare facilities like hospitals, clinics and other healthcare organizations that significantly improved the lives of their patients through innovative ideas and projects.For the Patient Care Initiative of the Year category, AHMC entered “S.T.E.P Up! Don’t Fall: AHMC Fall Prevention Success Story” which highlighted the various exploits of the Fall Prevention Committee in ensuring the decrease of patient fall rates.AHMC was recognized for its entry “Optimizing Delivery of Care to Critically-Ill Adult Covid-19 Patients” in the Clinical Service Initiative of the Year. The entry is the application of evidence-based researches on Covid-19 interventions resulting in higher survival rates.In pursuit of excellence and the sharing of best practices, AHMC Nursing Services and the University of Sto. Tomas (UST) College of Nursing recently renewed its partnership to develop career opportunities by providing nursing career development programs and related projects and activities. The partnership agreement was signed by AHMC’s Dr. Nicolo Andrei Añonuevo while UST was represented by Dr. Rowena Escobar Chua.AHMC also acquired a new partner in St. Dominic College of Asia (SDCA). At the signing were Dr. Carolona P Buhain, while SDCA is represented by Dr. Mary Nellie T. Roa.These partnerships will provide student nurses with opportunities in the various nursing specialties and the current nursing trends at AHMC highlighting the standards of the Joint Commission International. This will also help student nurses transition smoothly into AHMC’s working environment, giving them an edge over other student nurses.So far, AHMC has partnered with eight schools including Far Eastern University, Siena College, Philippine Women’s University and Southville International School and Colleges, among others.AHMC brought its expertise in dental medicine to Cebu as the hospital’s Department of Dental Medicine conducted a symposium titled “Updates on the Essentials of Comprehensive Orthodontic Treatment: A Lecture and Hands-on Workshop” which was led by Dr. Martin Antonio V. Reyes and Dr. Maria Janet Mapa-Pandan last April 18 and 19 at the City Sports Club in Cebu City.Dr. Reyes talked about how Effective Orthodontic Mechano Therapy is still the key for a successful outcome. During one and a half day workshop, he revisited the essentials in the three stages of Orthodontic treatment: leveling and alignment, space closure and detailing. He also shared how some of the basic techniques have changed over the years as well as reinforce the elements that should not compromised.Dr. Mapa-Pandan, on the other hand, presented cases in her lecture where the combined multi-disciplinary approach helped achieve stable and aesthetic results.Almost 100 dentists from different clinics and hospitals took part in the symposium.Last March 10, AHMC held its 7th Residents’ and Fellows’ Commencement Exercise at The Palms Country Club in Alabang, Muntinlupa. The guest speaker was Dr. John Añonuevo, the former chair of AHMC’s Department of Internal Medicine. Present during the ceremony were AHMC President and CEO Dr. Beaver Tamesis, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jose Acuin, AHMC leadership team and the families of residents and fellows.Dr. Candice Melgar, one of the 25 graduates, noted that a community was born during the pandemic years where residents and fellows had to share bed spaces and supported each other.“Our Medical Affairs family was the best. They took us in and made us feel the most comfortable here in the hospital. Food was abundant. They took measures to have mental health counselling. The support system we had here was beyond comparable,” she said.She thanked all the doctors who were with them through thick and through thin and that she will always treasure those moments.“Seeing your faces inside those bubbles, sweating with us, always throwing at each other the most recent studies and looking for solutions—all those moments. That bond will always be with us,” Melgar added.As AHMC celebrates its 21st anniversary, expect more packages and bundles, programs, events and campaigns to be launched by May and the rest of 2023."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/04/26/us-economy-loses-26-6-billion-each-year-for-failing-to-accommodate-menopause/,US economy loses $26.6 billion each year for failing to accommodate menopause,"The US economy is losing $26.6 billion a year due to lost productivity and health expenses resulting from employees who are managing menopause symptoms, according to a new report.The study from Mayo Clinic, which analyzed responses from over 4,400 women aged 45 to 60, found that nearly 11 percent reported missing work in the last 12 months due to symptoms like hot flashes and sleep disturbances.The annual cost for those missed workdays is $1.8 billion, not accounting for reduced work hours, employment loss or early retirement. At least 13% of the women surveyed reported they’d experienced at least one of the above outcomes due to symptoms. Meanwhile, direct medical costs related to menopause cost this age group an additional $24.8 billion annually.In 2021, a survey of 2,500 women from telehealth company Gennev found that 99 percent of women in this stage don’t get any menopause benefits at work.The Mayo Clinic report states that the findings of its survey “highlight a critical need to improve the medical treatment provided to women with menopause symptoms and an opportunity to make the workplace environment more supportive for women going through this universal life stage.”Women between the ages of 45 and 54 make up 20 percent of the female workforce in the US. Women of color are disproportionately affected, with Black women nearly three times more likely to report an adverse work outcome than their White counterparts. Hispanic women also reported higher rates of disruptions than White women.“Many women in midlife are at a time in their lives when they are experiencing career successes and achieving leadership roles,” according to the report. “That women may opt out of employment, and consequently out of the leadership development pipeline, identifies a potentially unrecognized reason for the leaky leadership pipeline and the paucity of women in senior leadership positions.”That leaky pipeline is getting worse: Female workers are leaving the top ranks of companies at higher rates than ever before. For every woman at the director level who gets promoted, two female directors are choosing to leave their company, according to an October McKinsey & Co. and LeanIn.org report.In a 2022 survey of US female workers aged 40 to 55, nearly a third of respondents said they’d think about shifting to part-time from full-time work, while 22 percent said they’d consider retiring early. Another survey out of the UK found 18 percent of women going through menopause are thinking about quitting their jobs altogether."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/04/20/palawan-is-the-only-province-that-is-not-yet-malaria-free-doh/,Palawan is the only province that is not yet malaria-free—DOH,"Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by plasmodium parasites transmitted by the anopheles mosquito or rarely through blood transfusion and sharing of contaminated needles causing acute febrile illness and symptoms in the form of fever, headache and chills.If left untreated, the Department of Health (DOH) warned, that P. falciparum malaria may progress to severe illness and possibly, death.The Philippines carried a high burden of malaria disease in the past but with the unrelenting efforts of the DOH-National Malaria Control and Elimination Program (NMCEP), the number of cases and deaths have been reduced significantly and as such, the country is now inching towards elimination.The DOH-NMCEP aims to eliminate malaria by adopting a health system focused approach to achieve universal coverage with quality-assured malaria diagnosis and treatment; strengthen governance and human resources; maintain the financial support needed, and ensure timely and accurate information management.THE DOH on Monday reiterated its commitment to achieving country-wide malaria-free status by 2030.“It shall continue to assist the last remaining province with local malaria transmission and bring it down to elimination levels as targeted,” DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire as she led the Malaria-Free Regional Convention organized by the Region IV-B Center for Health Development.Vergeire said that the DOH will provide technical and logistics assistance to the entire country in insuring that reintroduction is prevented and malaria-free status is sustained.“We reiterate our commitment to achieving country-wide Malaria-free status by 2030. The goal is within our reach, but we must continue our work to fully achieve this,” Vergeire said.VERGEIRE reported in a media forum on Tuesday that 80 out of 81 provinces in the Philippines were already declared as malaria-free.The only province where the disease has yet to be eliminated is Palawan.“Nag-iisa na lang…ang Palawan. Ang criteria nito [malaria-free] is the absence of local transmission of malaria for the past five years,” Vergeire said during DOH’s Media Forum on Tuesday.“Patuloy ang DOH sa pagtulong na mapababa ang atin pang mga local transmission sa bansa upang lahat ng probinsya ay makakamit ng [The DOH will continuously assist to lower the local transmission in the country so that all of the provinces will achieve the] elimination status. We will also facilitate the assessment of provinces with elimination status such that they, too, can join malaria-free provinces like Region 4A,” Vergeire added.THIS year’s theme is “Sulong Calabarzon, Sulong Kalusugan! Innovate, Invest and Implement Healthy and Malaria Free Communities,” which commits further progress to eliminate malaria in the country.The event was held to recognize the collaborative efforts and hard work of everyone who contributed to declaring provinces in Calabarzon as malaria-Free.Vergeire recognized the unwavering support and involvement of partners and stakeholders, including national government agencies (NGAs), non-government organizations (NGOs), local government units (LGUs), and Private Institutions for their assistance, proactive engagement, exemplary practices, accomplishments, and initiatives in attaining and sustaining a disease-free status.Further, the OIC called on them all to further raise awareness to preserve the region’s malaria-free status by preventing the re-introduction of malaria through a sustainable, calibrated, and comprehensive service delivery system.She also highlighted the region’s best practices to be expanded to other areas in the country.“Remember that, if treated early, malaria cases can be mitigated, and transmission and re-introduction can be prevented. The challenge laid out, the next step is sustainability, sustain zero malaria at all cost until the country finally achieves it,” Vergeire concluded.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/04/20/csmc-pushes-for-team-approach-to-tumor-management-this-brain-tumor-awareness-month/,CSMC pushes for team approach to tumor management this Brain Tumor Awareness Month,"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the country, third only to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. For less common cancers like brain cancer, however, there may not be enough awareness among Filipinos to prevent its onset, or resources to help those afflicted.“One common misconception is that frequent headaches must mean a brain tumor; that’s often not the case,” said Dr. Michael Louis Gimenez, resident neurosurgeon and Chairman of the Brain and Spine Institute at Cardinal Santos Medical Center (CSMC). “It’s possible, but there are a combination of symptoms that more accurately distinguish a possible brain tumor.”According to Gimenez, symptoms of a brain tumor manifest depending on the location in the brain. That being said, some common symptoms across the board are seizures, abnormal motor control, memory or thinking issues, nausea and vision problems.Because of the complex nature of diagnosing and treating brain tumors, Dr. Gimenez stated that it is best done at a multidisciplinary level, which is what led CSMC to establish its Brain and Spine Tumor Center.“We wanted to push a comprehensive, multidisciplinary and team-oriented approach to the evaluation and treatment of patients with brain and spine tumors,” he said. “When medical practitioners from different fields and disciplines work together to contribute their expertise in identifying and treating tumors, patients are able to receive consistent, timely, accurate and holistic care for their afflictions,” Dr. Gimenez said.At the Brain and Spine Tumor Center, patient cases are first assessed by a team of Neurologists, Neurosurgeons, and Medical Oncologists, then presented to all the team members for clinical review. Patients are informed of the team’s input soon after, allowing them to discuss their options and come to an informed decision about their diagnosis.“This approach is beneficial not just for the team handling the case, but also for the patient as well,” Dr. Gimenez noted. “Through this streamlined process we are able to facilitate timely planning and decision-making, and the expertise and opinions coming from different disciplines can be considered.”CSMC’s approach proves to be popular with patients, as the hospital has since seen a 600 percent increase in the number of patients served after its implementation.“We believe it’s because the Brain and Spine Tumor Center is a one-stop service for patients suffering from neurological diseases,” Dr. Gimenez shared. “Patients know that they have a team of experienced, excellent and compassionate medical professionals taking care of them from the moment they step through the hospital doors and all throughout their journey.”The Brain and Spine Tumor Center is also equipped with the latest neurosurgical equipment, a Neuro-ICU, a medical Neuro-oncology Unit, and radiotherapy facilities. It also boasts of the only Gamma Knife Radiosurgery unit in the Philippines.This dedication to provide the best quality of medical service to its patients has since been recognized at the 2022 Asian Hospital Management Awards, where CSMC was awarded the Excellence Award in Clinical Effectiveness Improvement for its multidisciplinary approach to brain and spine tumor management.“The CSMC Brain and Spine Tumor Center was organized to bring different medical fields together to deliver comprehensive and holistic cancer care and treatment,” Gimenez concluded. “We want our patients and potential patients to see how serious and committed we are to giving them quality medical care that they cannot get anywhere else.”For more information about the programs and services that CSMC offers, please visit .

The award coincided with the hospital’s year-long 50th anniversary celebration which kicked off last February 19, 2023.During the Healthcare Asia Awards gala at Shangri-la Singapore on March 29, 2023, VRPMC was introduced as a Top Covid Hospital in the Philippines for its rapid construction of an ER extension with 16-bed capacity and other ER amenities within a 50-day schedule with quality standards and protocols based on the Department of Health’s strict requirements for the license to operate. The ER extension doubled the ER capacity of the hospital at the height of the pandemic, and saved more lives with Covid-19 patient recovery rate of 85 percent in 2020 up to 96 percent in 2022.Present to receive the award were Virma Vergel de Dios, VRPMC President; Dr. Egarda Penserga, Medical Director; Veronica Garcia, Administrator; Eileen Natividad, Ancillary Head’ and Rosalie Operana, Marketing Head.“We redirected the plans to innovate new products and services to meet the patient’s emerging needs, including digital health solutions. We developed new and continuously strengthened our services,” Vergel De Dios said.With the concerted efforts of the management team, staff and stakeholders, VRPMC stayed afloat despite the financial distress. The hospital rebounded with the swift implementation of a hospital recovery plan which included efficient cost and cash flow management without compromising patient-centric care. The hospital administration also managed to not lay off employees and closed the collective bargaining agreement with the labor union with no liabilities.The award could not have come at a better time for VRPMC as it celebrates its 50th year this year with the theme “The Future from the Beginning.” Instead of the usual week long celebration, the hospital management decided to make it a year long celebration with 50 events.“Throughout the year, we will have a mix of major and pocket events and we had a grand kick off last February 19. We had a motorcade, a torch run and a thanksgiving mass. So Mom [De Dios] wanted it to be very special so we had five priests, one principal celebrant for each decade and our principal celebrant was Msgr. Socrates Villegas,” related Garcia in an interview with BusinessMirror.Present at the grand kick off which was held at Greenfields District Central Park were Mandaluyong City Major Benjamin Abalos, a representative of Mandaluyong City Rep. Neptali Gonzales Jr., and officials from the Mount Grace Network. VRPMC was the first hospital to join the network 10 years ago.“It was an exclusive event for employees but we also invited retired employees and doctors. Anyone who was with VRP was welcome to join. There were food concessionaires where guest were given vouches in denominations of 50, dancing and five performers from the last five decades,” Garcia continued.The management also took advantage of the opportunity to formally launch its new slogan “Alagang VRP.” “Ever since the pandemic, we have been using the ‘Alagang VRP’ branding so we also had an employee immersion training about our new slogan,” she said.As part of their anniversary celebration, VRPMC will be reopening and relaunching the centers and units that management was forced to close during the pandemic. The centers include the Cardiac Rehabilitation Center, the new Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, Kidney Transplant Facility, Wellness and Aesthetic Center, Diabetes, Obesity and Nutrition Center, among others.To close the anniversary celebration, VRPMC will have a more formal gala where the hospital will launch a coffee table book. Other activities that are scheduled include an HMO night, Physician’s Night and memorial lecture, golf tournament, among others.“VRPMC is on the road to recovery.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/04/20/doh-pushes-seven-healthy-habits-drive-through-health-fair-legislation/,"DOH pushes Seven Healthy Habits drive through health fair, legislation","Under the Universal Healthcare Law, the mandate of the Department of Health (DOH) is to strengthen its efforts when it comes to promoting the health of people in communities, learning and other identified institutions.To perform this mandate, the DOH is guided by the Health Promotion Framework Strategy (HPFS) 2021-2030, which serves as a long-term basis for population-wide solutions to the seven priority areas: diet and physical activity, environmental health, immunization, substance use, mental health, sexual and reproductive health, and violence and injury prevention.To achieve the establishment of a “Healthy Pilipinas,” the DOH held a two-day “National Health Fair Pista ng Kalusugan” at the Quezon Memorial Circle on April 15 and 16, 2023 to gain widespread awareness and encourage more Filipinos to adopt a healthier lifestyle and be well informed about the Seven Healthy Habits through informative discussions, engaging experience zones, and free medical services such as tuberculosis and breast cancer screening and help promote a “Healthy Barangay, Healthy Pilipinas.”The DOH and its partners came up with seven immersive booths, all related to each of the seven habits: Move More, Eat Right; Be Clean, Live Sustainably; Get Vaccinated; Don’t Smoke, Avoid Alcohol, Say No to Drugs; Care for Yourself, Care for Others; Practice Safe Sex; and Do No Harm, Put Safety First.IN a speech read by the representative of Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte in the event, Quezon City Assistant City Administrator for General Affairs head Atty. Rene Grapilon, said that for a city with more than three million residents, the local government is deeply committed to the health and well-being of its citizens.“As one of the biggest cities in the country, we face our fair share of health challenges and this pushes us to revamp our health initiatives and create a healthier Quezon City. We firmly believe that health care is not just about providing medical services but also empowering our residents with knowledge and tools to make healthier choices in their daily lives. To create a real impact, we need to use a multi-faceted approach and combine multiple strategies that will work together seamlessly,” the speech stated.AMONG the seven habits, Undersecretary Dr. Enrique Tayag from the DOH Field Implementation and Coordination Team for North Luzon, said they are focusing on immunization, particularly since World Immunization Week is happening from April 24 to 30, 2023. He reminded the fair participants that vaccination is still the most effective way to protect people, particularly children, from life-threatening diseases.“No child should perish from any disease that can be prevented with the help of vaccines that can combat specific types of diseases and are fit for varying ages, from pregnant to new-born children up to one year. There are also vaccines for female adolescents to prevent cervical cancer, and the flu and pneumonia vaccines for the elderly,” Dr. Tayag noted.It is important, he said, for children to complete all vaccines to make sure they are protected against deadly diseases while they are growing up. “Vaccination should continue for children based on their Routine Immunization schedule. All these vaccines are safe and effective since these passed through rigorous, strict and scientific processes to make sure they are truly safe and effective. The best part is that these vaccines are given to health centers and are free to the public,” he continued.MEANWHILE, Assistant Secretary Dr. Beverly Lorraine Ho from the Public Health Services Team of the DOH, said it is not just about having the best services at clinics but also about giving everyone the opportunity to be healthy. “We really want more people to know about the Seven Healthy Habits. Many of us, when we hear the word health, we think of hospitals or clinics. Though it is part of health, other sectors also have contributions when it comes to health,” she said in her speech.That is why she expressed gratitude to the DOH’s partners present during the event such as Dr. Malalay Ahmadzai, Chief of Health and Nutrition at UNICEF, Dr. Achyut Shrestha, Medical Officer, Vaccine Preventable Diseases and Immunization from the World Health Organization, Michelle Lang-Alli, Director of the Office of Health at the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and other participants, and of course Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte, who was represented by Atty. Grapilon, and Rep. Stella Quimbo, Marikina 2nd District Representative.She emphasized the importance of raising awareness about the Seven Healthy Habits, and pointed out that the DOH and local government units (LGUs) have many platforms to be able to teach and share important knowledge and skills about being healthy.In an interview with the BusinessMirror, Dr. Ho emphasized that the event is part of the activation process to get everyone excited. “We want to emphasize that for the Seven Healthy Habits, it will not be just the DOH or the health sector that will move on this. Many other sectors should help one another and the DOH will become more collaborative with them to achieve our goals.”She also revealed that the DOH is working with friends from the legislature such as the House of Representatives and the Senate in relation to the healthy habits. She said that part of what they are working on is food labeling, which is already common in other countries. “We want to help consumers through this so every time they buy a food product, for example, they would already know if it’s healthy or not. Then there’s also the trans-fat elimination bill where studies are ongoing at the House and the Senate so these are some of the things we are pushing for,” Dr. Ho related."

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/04/15/nations-lifeblood/,Nation’s Lifeblood,"THE Philippines is among the countries that have undergone numerous catastrophes and tragedies, whether natural or man-made.Being seated in the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire” makes it highly vulnerable to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. This tropical nation, likewise, experiences at least 20 typhoons yearly on the average. It’s not even spared from the impacts of climate change in the past recent years: think Haiyan (Yolanda), billed as the strongest cyclone ever to hit land.As if the natural calamities were not enough, the country had to deal the past three years with the pandemic. While the ensuing health crisis situation has somewhat eased, it still faces the threats of Covid-19, fully recovering towards post-pandemic. Beyond all these adversities, Filipinos often find themselves at the center of several conflicts and violence here and abroad.Fortunately, the (PRC) has always been there for Filipinos to turn to in times of need and emergencies. Through the years, the country’s foremost humanitarian organization has never failed to extend assistance or be of good service to every Filipino anytime, anywhere.DOWN memory lane, a closer look at its past makes everyone appreciates more the PRC, which turns 75 today (April 15), as a bastion of heroism and compassion that never ceases to amaze and inspire every Juan to also do good unto others.Leafing through the pages of its memoir reveals that it was Apolinario Mabini, the heart and brains of the Philippine Revolution, who paved the way for its inception when he encouraged the founders of the Malolos Republic to approve the Constitution of the National Association of the Red Cross on February 17, 1899, with Hilaria del Rosario de Aguinaldo as the appointed president.From just being a local unit of the American National Red Cross at the turn of the 19th century, forming the standalone Philippine branch of the Red Cross was initiated by President Manuel L. Quezon in 1934. Since his Commonwealth government could not sign the Geneva Conventions, it did not push through—until the country became independent from the American regime.On February 14, 1947, President Manuel A. Roxas inked the Treaty of Geneva and the Prisoners of War Convention. Over a month after, he signed Republic Act 95, mandating the creation of the PRC. This was followed by Aurora Aragon Quezon, the organization’s first chairman, receiving a cable from Geneva, which meant the recognition for the PRC, as per approval of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).The PRC’s charter has been amended several times since its creation. In 2010, then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed into law Republic Act 10072, otherwise known as the Philippine Red Cross Act of 2009, penned by Senator and Philippine National Red Cross (PNRC) Chairman Richard J. Gordon. Officially, it changed the name of PNRC to PRC.Since then, the organization has grown by leaps and bounds. Starting off with merely 13 chapters in 1947, the PRC is currently comprised of 102 chapters, serving millions of Filipinos nationwide.BECAUSE the Philippines was under tumultuous times during the formative years of this philanthropic association, its primary role back then was to collect blood from donors.“The Red Cross was known for blood in 1947, when we got our independence [and, then,] when we first got our Charter by International Convention. Also, disasters were forthcoming in the 1950s, [with the rise of the] Hukbalahap [Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon],” Gordon told the in an interview. “In fairness to the past, the Red Cross people in V. Luna, they gave psychosocial support. But the focus, [starting with] Rosa Rosal, was blood.”While PRC had already made its mark in this kind of service, eventually, it has evolved from a blood-collection agency to a full-fledged humanitarian organization in 1992, following the Mount Pinatubo eruption. During the time, its chapters in Tarlac and Zambales helped set up makeshift shelters to accommodate the displaced people overcrowding the evacuation centers. Augmenting their efforts was Gordon, mayor of Olongapo City back then, who deployed a fleet of vehicles to move the evacuees from San Marcelino in Zambales to his bailiwick.Apart from responding to this historic event, the country and the rest of the world have witnessed the PRC coming as fast as it could to the aid of those in need whenever there is any disaster like typhoons, earthquakes, armed conflicts, disease outbreaks, and even emergencies concerning Filipinos outside of the country. It has built more than 155,000 houses for those left homeless by such misfortunes and has developed a sizable network of trained emergency medical services staff.“We were challenged all throughout the 75 years. In the last 20 years, we beat all these challenges,” he said.KEEPING up with the changing times, the organization had to adopt new technologies and strategies in so far as extending humanitarian services is concerned—thanks to the election of Senator Gordon as chairman and chief executive officer in 2004.“The Red Cross became modernized during my term,” he told the , while citing some initiatives he led the past two decades meant to make the PRC well-equipped with the latest technologies and innovations to bring quality service in a fast and efficient manner.In so doing, he inspired many people to become part of this noble organization. Showing good leadership by example by being always and first on the ground to respond during uncertainties, the PRC has seen its national network of volunteers grow to around 1.5 million at present, making it the largest humanitarian group in the Philippines. Over the last six months, the administration of Gordon has been developing a comprehensive map or database containing the names and contact details of all the individual volunteers, first-aiders and even medical doctors and specialists that the public can have access to for assistance during disasters or emergencies.With ample and capable manpower in place, PRC’s modernization and expansion program beefed up its logistics so as to deliver more services on time, with the support of information technology. The organization invested heavily in rolling assets to improve further its response capabilities. Currently, it has a fleet of 178 ambulances, 38 food trucks, rescue trucks, fire trucks, Humvees, amphibious vehicles, rubber boats, wing vans, water tankers with water bladders, and payloaders to clear debris after calamities. Given the country’s archipelagic setup, a humanitarian ship called the MV was acquired as another crucial asset in its rescue and relief operations on various islands.At the core of fulfilling its tasks is the PRC’s Operations Center or “OpCen,” which serves as the command hub linked to all its chapters all over the country. This state-of-the-art center allows the organization to respond immediately to any emergency, providing a coordinated action that optimizes the impact of volunteers and logistics.“That’s why our slogan is, ‘Volunteers + Logistics + Information Technology = A Red Cross that is always first, always ready, and always there,’” the PRC chief said. “We want to be the lifeline of the country. We want to be the partner of choice of different partners.”BOLD and brave, the PRC always steps out of its way to take responsibilities beyond its known competence.Prior to Covid-19, Gordon already had predicted a few years back that this could happen after reading the book, by John M. Barry that examines the Spanish flu, one of the worst pandemics in world history that occurred from 1918 to 1920.Then came the latter part of 2019, when the coronavirus outbreak unfolded in China and started to become a pandemic early 2020. As soon as the lockdown was imposed in Metro Manila and some parts of the country with increasing cases of infections mid-March of that year, PRC was one of the leading organizations to respond to this health crisis.“That is not our skills set. We’re in blood. But still we put up 100 tents all over the country,” he said of the fully equipped isolation facilities they built in hospitals and some schools to accommodate the rising number of patients that were not admitted to hospitals due to lack of beds.The organization, likewise, blazed the trail to build the first molecular laboratory for testing in the country, which earned praise from government officials who visited the facility. Such testing lab now counts at 14 spread across the nation—each costing around P25 million. Apart from swabbing, it also pioneered saliva testing.“From the very start, we were representing about 65 percent to 70 percent of the testing,” the PRC chairman and CEO shared, while citing their leadership in terms of output: conducting 5,692,158 tests out of the total of 34,876,958 nationwide as of April 11.Red Cross in the Philippines, with its compassion and benevolence, is not only at the forefront of responding to Filipinos during times of tragedies, but also extends a helping hand even to foreign lands. Since 2005, PRC has become a donor society by giving monetary assistance to various countries confronted with various calamities. The latest of which were Turkey and Syria, which were jolted by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake on February 6—each receiving $100,000.“This only shows that we also became a donor country,” Gordon stressed. “So a lot of things were done by the Red Cross.”With this visionary leader at the helm of PRC, this humanitarian organization could well continue to become the torch bearer of heroism and kindness for every Juan.Image credits: , , , , Roderick L.

The Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the trial early as the primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) has been met. Ribociclib plus ET significantly reduced the risk of disease recurrence, compared to standard adjuvant ET alone, with consistent benefit in patients with stage II and stage III EBC regardless of nodal involvement.“While most patients are diagnosed and treated early with the aim to cure breast cancer, the risk of cancer returning, often as metastatic disease, peaks within three years after diagnosis, but never goes away completely,” said Dennis J. Slamon, MD, Director of Clinical/Translational Research, University of California, Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center and Chairman and Executive Director of Translational Research In Oncology (TRIO) and NATALEE trial lead investigator. “There is a critical need for new, well-tolerated options that keep patients cancer-free without disrupting quality of life. The NATALEE trial, where ribociclib was given for three years plus ET, was designed with these unmet needs in mind, and it is extremely encouraging that this study met its primary endpoint.”Per the NATALEE study protocol, patient follow-up will continue to evaluate long-term outcomes, including overall survival.“The positive topline results from NATALEE represent a major milestone in our ambition to expand the benefits of ribociclib to patients with earlier stages of breast cancer, building on the heritage of this effective treatment in HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer,” said Shreeram Aradhye, M.D., President, Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “These data have the potential to be paradigm-shifting for patients at risk of recurrence, including those with no nodal involvement, who have limited well-tolerated options to prevent recurrence. Our teams are working on submissions to health authorities around the world with the hope to bring ribociclib to many more patients diagnosed with breast cancer.”“The result of the NATALEE trial is a welcome development in the management of breast cancer, offering new hope for a longer life in a broad population of patients with stage II and III HR-positive/HER2-negative early breast cancer at risk of recurrence,” said Dr. Rosario V. Pitargue, President, Philippine Society of Medical Oncology (PSMO).“These findings build on the legacy of ribociclib in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Ribociclib is the first and only CDK4/6 inhibitor so far to have shown both consistent and significant improvements in overall survival across 3 phase III trials,” said Mr. Joel Chong, Country President, Novartis Healthcare Philippines, Inc.Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/22/measles-cases-on-the-rise-doh-to-conduct-immunization-drive-in-may/,Measles cases on the rise; DOH to conduct immunization drive in May,"In the Philippines, an estimated 2.4 million children under the age of five are susceptible for measles. Measles or tigdas is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. On Tuesday, March 21, the Department of Health (DOH) reported that there is a 541 percent increase in measles and rubella cases in the first two months of 2023.DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the DOH will conduct a supplemental immunization activity, in order for them to address the spike in cases. The activity will start on May.“Let’s go back to the homes of the missed children so that we can vaccinate them. We will vaccinate those who are not only scheduled for vaccination but also those who missed their dose last year or the previous year. We have to do this so that they are protected against measles,” Vergeire said.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), measles is caused by a virus in the paramyxovirus family and it is normally passed through direct contact and through the air. It is spread by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact or direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions.The virus infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body. Measles is a human disease and is not known to occur in animals.The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours. It can be transmitted by an infected person from four days prior to the onset of the rash to four days after the rash erupts.The first sign of measles, the WHO said, is usually high fever, which begins about 10 to 12 days after exposure to the virus, and lasts four to seven days. A runny nose, a cough, red and watery eyes, and small white spots inside the cheeks can develop in the initial stage. After several days, a rash erupts, usually on the face and upper neck.Over about three days, the rash spreads, eventually reaching the hands and feet. The rash lasts for five to six days, and then fades. On average, the rash occurs 14 days after exposure to the virus (within a range of 7 to 18 days).Most measles-related deaths are caused by complications associated with the disease.Serious complications are more common in children under the age of five, or adults over the age of 30. The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhea and related dehydration, ear infections, or severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia. Severe measles is more likely among poorly nourished young children, especially those with insufficient vitamin A, or whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV/AIDS or other diseases.Unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles and its complications, including death.Also, unvaccinated pregnant women are also at risk. Any non-immune person, who has not been vaccinated or was vaccinated but did not develop immunity, can become infected.Measles outbreaks can result in epidemics that cause many deaths, especially among young, malnourished children. In countries where measles has been largely eliminated, cases imported from other countries remain an important source of infection.There is no specific antiviral treatment exists for measles virus.Severe complications from measles can be reduced through supportive care that ensures good nutrition, adequate fluid intake and treatment of dehydration with WHO-recommended oral rehydration solution.This solution replaces fluids and other essential elements that are lost through diarrhea or vomiting. Routine measles vaccination for children, combined with mass immunization campaigns are key public health strategies to reduce global measles deaths. The measles vaccine is often incorporated with rubella and/or mumps vaccines.“It is equally safe and effective in the single or combined form. Adding rubella to measles vaccine increases the cost only slightly, and allows for shared delivery and administration costs,” WHO stated.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/22/cerebral-bypass-surgeryis-now-an-optionfor-stroke-patients/,Cerebral bypass surgery is now an option for stroke patients,"THE brain is the most delicate organ affected when stroke strikes. Once this medical emergency happens, arteries will either be blocked so that they fail to bring enough blood supply to the brain, or it can burst leading to internal hemorrhage in the gray matter.Chances are limited to remedy this. First is by way of clots removal from the brain via thrombolytics. Second is by taking clot-busting medicines, which only works if the patient is brought in not later than three hours when the symptoms start to manifest. Beyond such time up to 24 hours, endovascular intervention like mechanical thrombectomy can remove the clot that is clogging up the artery.In case the patient goes further the prescribed time, opportunities for medical treatment decrease. Surgical and medical options that are in place are all well and good, but they require time. So everyone is advised to think twice of their health now and bid adieu to their bad habits related to risks of having it. It’s a serious thing that should not be taken for granted.AT the Asian Hospital and Medical Center (AHMC), there came a 71-year-old man from Great Britain, who had a couple of stroke episodes within two weeks. He was incapable of moving physically upon his arrival. Other than that, he also had other complications, such as bladder cancer, heart problems, and a weak body because of his senior age.Given his situation, the British post-stroke patient and his family could not wish for more than the stability of his condition anew. His case was handled by neurologist Dr. Josephine Tuason, who took note of all his medical history to determine the best medical option for him.When he stabilized, she ordered a diagnostic test to find out the principal cause of the patient’s stroke. The finding was that an artery on the right side of his brain was completely obstructed, leading to lack of blood supply. If left untreated, it could cause permanent damage because of dead brain cells.Seeing his past medical records, Dr. Tuason already knew that he could not survive another stroke. Hence, she gathered a multidisciplinary team of experts to search for a solution to save the patient without compromising his other secondary illnesses.So he underwent to a cerebral catheter angiogram performed by Dr. Francis Santiago, an endovascular surgeon. An MR perfusion or a specialized magnetic resonance technique that helps diagnose conditions in the braind, likewise, was done. The team then identified one medical procedure that could bring him quality of life again and lessen the chances of a repeat stroke.But such an operation is not widely performed for such cases in the Philippines, thus, making his wife initially reject it. Determined to cure the patient, Dr. Tuason and her team explained that this will not only stabilize her husband; it will also increase his chances to regain quality of life and combat post-stroke effects. Slowly, he will move again and the probability of a stroke will significantly decrease. All these had his wife take a leap of faith later, and then accepted the presented medical choice.AS the patient’s family finally agreed to medical team’s proposed procedure, Dr. Tuason sought for the conduct of a complete workup to check his eligibility to go through a breakthrough procedure at AHMC: cerebral bypass surgery.This is aimed at restoring good blood flow to the brain by changing the blocked artery with a brand-new one taken from the patient’s scalp. This will, then, be linked to the brain arteries via tiny sutures using a very fine thread that’s hardly visible to the naked eye. Once connected, it should give the patient rapid improvement in blood flow.Dr. Guillermo Victorino Liabres, the hospital’s cerebrovascular neurosurgeon, did the surgery. He is completely trained to do so and is the pioneer in consistently successful extracranial-intracranial bypass surgeries in the country.“What we can do in the heart, we can now do in the brain,” Dr. Tuason said, while citing that akin to a heart bypass, they also stopped more damage to the patient’s brain by fully replacing the clogged artery that quickly restored good blood stream.In return, it reduced the side effects of stroke and accelerate the patient’s recovery. In fact, he could feel movements on the left side of his body in just two days after the surgery. He could then move his lower extremities after two week. What’s more, the frequency of taking medicine became less, and the potential of developing another stroke attack tremendously went down—thanks to his new unclogged artery.AHMC’s Asian Brain Institute continuously looks at advancing medical cures for neurologic conditions and guarantees that patients will have end-to-end treatment plans comparable with global standards while near their homes.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/22/regular-screening-lifestyle-change-are-best-bets-to-prevent-colon-cancer/,"Regular screening, lifestyle change are best bets to prevent colon cancer","HE is known and acknowledged as the true-blue “Iron Man” of Asia’s pioneering professional basketball league, the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), having played a record 744 consecutive games. This record effectively eclipsed the previous mark of 596 games held by Alvin Patrimonio, a former league Most Valuable Player.However, LA Tenorio’s streak was halted on March 1, 2023 when he failed to play because of a groin injury.And even more unfortunate, Tenorio announced in a statement two days ago that he was diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer, already underwent surgery and will soon undergo treatment in the next few months.The news reverberated in the entire basketball world. Even those who don’t follow basketball regularly but are aware of Tenorio’s superstar athlete status in the sport, were taken by surprise by this shocking development.BASED on the latest data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) with regard to the top three causes of death in the Philippines from January to September 2022, it showed ischemic or cardiovascular diseases, followed by cerebrovascular diseases, and neoplasms, commonly called “cancer,” as the top three killers in the country.There were 77,173 cases recorded of ischemic heart diseases for a 18.5 percent share of the total deaths in the country, while cerebrovascular diseases was second with 42,890 deaths or 18.3-percent share. Cancer came a close third with 42,497 recorded cases for a 10.2-percent share.The ranking was practically the same the previous year in the similar period, except that Covid-19 came in third at that time.What’s surprising, however, was that colon cancer was recorded as the second most prevalent type of cancer in the country this year.THE Cleveland Clinic says that colon cancer begins in the large intestine, when abnormal cell growths or polyps start to multiply in the colon lining and rectum. Like most cancers, when left untreated, this disease can spread to other parts of the body.According to Dr. Kristine Monte, resident oncologist at the Cardinal Santos Medical Center (CSMC), colon cancer is actually more common than we think. “We’re aware of all these cancers, breast cancer, of course, is the most prevalent. Then we have lung cancer, reproductive cancers like cervical, ovarian, and prostate cancer. However, colon cancer is actually more common than we think.”She said that colon cancer can affect anyone, regardless of gender or age group. “Even if a family has no history of colon cancer, an individual may still be at risk of developing it if he or she is prone to excessive drinking and smoking, consuming too much processed foods and red meat, are overweight or obese or have Type 2 diabetes,” according to Dr. Monte.IN order to help provide vital information, CSMC held a lay forum on colon cancer recently as part of the celebration of Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month in the country. The forum focused on dispelling myths surrounding the illness and emphasized on the value of spreading awareness and the importance of regular screening to the public.Dr. Monte reiterated that in order to prevent the onset of colon cancer, it is important to make the right changes to one’s lifestyle. “It’s important to maintain a normal weight and avoid becoming overweight or obese,” she said.Among her recommendations regarding diet or food intake is to reduce consumption of red meat such as pork and beef, plus high-fat food items such as deep-fried food or fast food. “It is best to Increase intake of green leafy vegetables like pechay, lettuce, legumes and herbs and fiber-rich fruits like papaya, pineapple or mango.”Also, among the big ideas to prevent colon cancer is to avoid smoking and drinking too much alcoholic beverages, and to do physical exercises regularly. She said at least 20 to 30 minutes of exercise daily will already be a big help in maintaining a healthy weight.Dr. Monte strongly encourages patients to consult their doctor, especially if their family has a history of colon cancer or they are experiencing unusual symptoms similar to those of colon cancer, such as persistent abdominal discomfort, unexplained weight loss, change in bowel movement or rectal bleeding.WHEN asked how to detect colon cancer, Dr. Monte said colonoscopy remains as a recommended method. She said it helps doctors identify and diagnose colorectal cancers early on, which in turn, helps reduce cancer deaths and reduce the suffering experienced by patients. It is also advised, she added, that patients start regular colorectal cancer screening by the age of 50 and get Fecal Immunohistochemical Testing every year.Other tests, like the Flexible Sigmoidoscopy, CT Colonography, and Double Contrast Barium Enema should be done every five years, and Colonoscopies should be conducted every 10 years, Dr. Monte stated.She underscored that two of CSMC’s flagship specializations are Oncology and Gastroenterology, so it’s safe to say that the institution is very much invested in people’s colorectal health. “We offer a variety of services such as the standard Colonoscopy, and we are very proud of the world-class facilities and expert clinicians we have in-house.”Finally, Dr. Monte stressed that colon cancer is very much preventable if medical providers are able to catch and treat it immediately. “That’s why it’s so important to encourage regular screening for colon cancer.”"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/22/barmm-officials-endorse-and-launch-period-tracker-app-for-bangsamoro-girls/,BARMM officials endorse and launch period tracker app for Bangsamoro girls,"Data from the Department of Education’s (DepEd) 2020-2021 Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) in Schools monitoring report showed that one out of two girls have access to menstrual hygiene products in schools in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).Likewise, there is also a lack of access to information on menstrual, sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR).On the occasion of Women’s Month, the BARMM government endorsed the new Oky Philippines Period Tracker App in Cotabato City developed by the Bangsamoro Government, UNICEF and Plan International.The latest data from the Philippine Statistics Authority showed a 6.6 percent rate of teenage pregnancy among the 15 to 19-year-old Bangsamoro girls, higher than the national average of 5.4 percent in 2022.Oky is the world’s first period tracker app that features a girl-led design and gamified approach to learning about menstruation and SRHR. The launch event, “Okay sa Oky: Ang Period Tracker para sa Babaeng Bangsamoro, mula sa Babaeng Bangsamoro,” raised awareness on issues and challenges surrounding Menstrual Health and Hygiene (MHH), particularly in the context of BARMM, and gave a preview of the app co-created with and for Bangsamoro girls.It also marked the start of a wider initiative in the country to make this innovative digital solution accessible to all Filipino girls and women and provide them with girl-friendly information on menstruation, puberty, and reproductive health.The global app has been localized in the Philippines through a partnership between UNICEF, Plan International and the BARMM Regional Government, with support from the Australian Government.“The launch of the localized Oky app reaffirms the BARMM government’s commitment to promote the welfare and rights of young girls in the region. By providing the right information about girls’ menstrual health in line with Islamic principles and cultural practices, we hope to create a supportive environment for their health and well-being and encourage their full participation in educational opportunities,” said BARMM Chief Minister Ahod Ebrahim.The app comes with Islamic content developed through consultations with adolescent girls and boys in BARMM. Key government offices in BARMM including the Office of the Chief Minister, Bangsamoro Darul-Ifta, Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Social Services and Development, Bangsamoro Youth Council, and Bangsamoro Information Office played a major role in vetting Oky’s Islamic content and ensuring its alignment to Islamic teachings.The localization of the Oky app in the Philippines is supported by the Australian Government as part of its AUD 48 million Indo-Pacific Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights Covid-19 Response Program. The program includes support for countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.“Australia is proud to play a role in supporting the BARMM, UNICEF and Plan International to provide girls with this much needed digital tool to manage their own health and take charge of their own lives. The Oky App is a great example of how innovation and transformative technology helps create positive change for young women and girls to make informed choices,” said Ambassador to the Philippines HK Yu.Meanwhile, UNICEF Mindanao Field Office Chief Radoslaw Rzehak congratulated the BARMM government for helping localize the Oky app in the country and championing every Bangsamoro girl’s access to evidence-based knowledge and information about menstruation.“Ensuring access to trustworthy information on menstrual health is an important step in ending period stigma and ensuring adolescent girls’ right to health and dignity,” Rzehak said. For her part, Plan International Philippines Country Director Ana Maria Locsin said that their effort to provide a Filipino version of the Oky period tracker app is a fulfillment of their commitment to support girls and young women in the Philippines in realizing their right to manage their menstruation in a safe and healthy way, with dignity and without shame.“How girls experience their period during those formative years can define their perception of life as a girl or woman in this society, and it is important that we take this step to make adolescent-friendly information on sexual and reproductive health more accessible,” said Locsin.Oky Philippines is already available for download from the Google Play Store ().To encourage more girls and young women to download the app and gain access to health and hygiene information right at their fingertips, the rollout of the app will follow in various communities across Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/21/the-important-role-of-gut-health-in-childrens-immunity/,The important role of gut health in children’s immunity,"Improving gut health is essential for children’s immune system to be better prepared in fighting off illnesses and infections since 70% of the immune system resides in the gut. The first step to strengthen gut health is by understanding the – this consists of trillions of microorganisms in the intestine that communicate with our organs and immune system, impacting our overall health.Some bacteria, fungi, and viruses that live within our gut protect us against harmful germs and help break down non-digestible substrates such as dietary fibers to support the growth of specialist microbes which can affect health outcomes.The formation of a healthy microbiome begins very early on. Developing a healthy gut begins after birth, where children would inherit these gut microbiotas from their parents.As children grow, the importance of gut health needs to be recognized to ensure proper development and lifelong health. Maintaining a healthy gut environment for the microbiota to develop is crucial in the early years of life, helping young children to build a strong digestive and immune system.What is the key to unlocking a healthy gut microbiome? Nutrition.When gut bacteria are properly nourished, they can grow, diversify and multiply – all of which help to strengthen children’s immune systems, which will positively impact their growth and cognitive development.Abbott scientists have been constantly studying the impact of the microbiome on children’s immune system for decades, leading to various innovations such as our research on human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). HMO is a major component of human-produced milk which is found to contribute to the development of the child’s immune system.In 2005, Abbott conducted its first clinical study on a formula with HMO. After numerous studies through the years, Abbott made a breakthrough by introducing Similac GainSchool as the first milk formula with 2’-fucosyllactose (2’-FL) HMO, which was launched in the Philippines in 2018. 2’-FL is by far the most prevalent HMO found in nature, and extensive studies have shown 2’-FL positively impacts child immunity.For parents who choose to use formula milk, Abbott’s commitment to scientific-forward nutrition continues. Today, the newly reformulated Similac GainSchool is the world’s first formula that contains an exclusive blend of the five most abundant HMOs, representing ~60% of total HMOs in nature to improve children’s immunity. It helps strengthen children’s defenses against infection. For example, 2’-FL found in Similac GainSchool is associated with 66% lower respiratory infections. This next generation of Similac GainSchool also contains added gangliosides – complex lipids naturally found in the brain – and other essential nutrients for stronger, faster, and more efficient brain connections.With the world slowly opening up, parents want nothing more than to see their children grow to be stronger, smarter, and healthier than ever, especially now that children are back in school and outdoors again. While best hygiene practices such as mask-wearing, hand-washing and physical distancing can give our children protection – let’s not forget that the best-kept secret in preventing illness and boosting the immune system is in nourishing the gut microbiome: Proper nutrition.The new reformulated Similac GainSchool is a product of Abbott’s commitment in keeping children healthy through proper nutrition. By providing solutions that give stronger immunity, better cognition and faster brain connections, together, we can help children grow and thrive in a new world where they can live their best lives through good health. https://www.nutritionnews.abbott/pregnancy-childhood/infant-toddler/six-ways-to-boost-your-childs-immune-system/ Valdes A, Walter J, Segal E, Spector T.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/20/injecting-new-life-into-asian-hospital/,Injecting new life into Asian Hospital,"He was just leaning to enjoy retirement when he received a call from the former Human Resources director of MSD who had joined Metro Pacific Health (MPH), the largest private hospital operator in the Philippines. It has a nationwide portfolio of 19 hospitals, supported by two allied health colleges, a growing network of primary care clinics and cancer care centers, and a central clinical laboratory.“I wasn’t aware that he had joined MPH and he talked to me about the challenges that Metro Pacific Health was going through and their vision was to integrate all of these hospitals together,” recalled Dr. Beaver R. Tamesis, President and CEO of Asian Hospital and Medical Center.“In particular, he mentioned that Asian Hospital is their flagship and they asked me to come in to see what I could do in terms of growing the reach of Asian Hospital and increasing the number of patients we could actually serve. So I said that it sounded interesting. It’s related to health but not really something that I had focused on all of my career. So I said yes, I might as well try a different challenge,” he continued.His family could only scratch their heads and wonder why Dr. Tamesis decided to go back to work after having worked for MSD for 27 years. His last eight years were spent as Managing Director and President of MSD. He also served as President of the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines for six years.DR. TAMESIS pointed out that this would be the first time he would be managing a hospital full time. His only experience of working at a hospital was to contribute ideas to the marketing department of another tertiary hospital.“It’s extremely different from running a pharmaceutical company. However, there are many areas of commonalities and it’s really the people. It’s really about how you grow people, recognize talent, and give them the recognition that is due them and then plan their career growth. In that way you can constantly motivate them, you can keep them excited waking up in the morning to come to work because they know they are doing something, contributing something for the greater good. That aspect is very, very similar,” he said.As for running a hospital, Dr. Tamesis pointed out that he had to address many concerns. This included the air conditioning, power consumption, the daily influx of patients, whether the patients are getting the right service at the right time, privacy concerns and the doctor community.“During my first couple of months, I would conduct listening tours just to listen to the doctors, what their thoughts were, what they wanted Asian Hospital to be, how they saw themselves participating in the growth, development and fulfillment of the potential of Asian Hospital,” he said.“So those were the myriad of issues that I had to face, to deal with but the good thing is that I was able to bring in all the 27 years of management experience that I had. That was readily transportable,” Dr. Tamesis added.WITH regards to his plans for Asian Hospital, Dr. Tamesis said the hospital “has to be able to fulfill its potential,” noting that the hospital has not been fully outfitted for all floors“We still need to be able to reach out to the greater public so that it is not just the village dwellers. We have to be broader, ‘democratic’ in terms of the people that we reach, the services that we have for them,” he said, adding that Asian also needs to bring in the different types of technology and modes of treatment that are already present in the different parts of the world.He acknowledged though that Asian Hospital already “has some fantastic stuff.” Dr. Tamesis said he was proud of the Asian Cancer Institute because it has the Tomotherapy where “you don’t actually need to screw in a metal crown” and that the radiation beams are able to hit the tumors without having to involve the surrounding tissue.Asian Hospital’s cardiovascular services, Dr. Tamesis said, “is really top of the time in terms of world-class quality.”“We are ensuring that all our pathways are there to make sure that any heart attack patient who comes through the door, we can attend to them immediately and actually even do angioplasty if necessary on some of these patients,” he added.In terms of stroke care, he pointed out that Asian Hospital is also capable of carrying out brain bypass surgery.“We have heard all about heart bypass surgery and now we can also do brain bypass surgery. Our clinical staff is doing a lot of fantastic work and they are already starting to integrate all the things that we do, our pathways, among others,” he said.Dr. Tamesis also lauded the nursing care at Asian Hospital, describing the level of attention they give to patients as “unsurpassed in terms of quality.” While he acknowledged that the country is suffering from a shortage of nurses, Dr. Tamesis said Asian Hospital is fortunate that it has “a steady supply of nurses.”“We have a regular pipeline so that we can constantly replace those who feel the need to already migrate. This means that we have tie-ups with schools, the review centers so that when they pass the board exams, we have a steady supply of nurses who can potentially come in with the appropriate orientation and get familiarized with the different tools that we have and eventually be deployed,” Dr. Tamesis said.WHEN asked about his management style, Dr. Tamesis said he wanted to be more collaborative and be more of a coach. He sees himself encouraging his staff to adopt their innovations, helping them to open their eyes and give them a new perspective of things.“Oftentimes, they find the solutions themselves. That is what I love about a really smart, knowledgeable and highly experienced management time. Oftentimes, it is just a matter of opening their eyes or giving them a different perspective. They can really run it,” he said,He describes his first few months at the helm of Asian Hospital as “extremely intense” as he was going through the listening tours and trying to understand the issues of Asian Hospital and what more can be done to bring the hospital to its full potential.“I think we came up with the right diagnosis and my leadership team got fully o board with it and we signed off in the middle of January that this is what we are going to work on and already we are seeing hopeful signs that people are responding,” Dr. Tamesis noted.AS TO where he sees himself five years from now, Dr. Tamesis said he sees himself going back to the beach to enjoy his retirement.“I often tell people that we have to plan our obsolescence because sooner or later we have to have a successor. It is important that we always and constantly think of the next person in line so that we can move them up and groom them because that is also a way of retaining them,” he related.He also regularly checks on himself to ensure that he is not stale and that he continues to bring value to the company he works for.“I can tell you that after eight years of sitting in my President and CEO role of the previous company, I could feel that I was getting a bit stale. It would be unfair for the company if I continued. They had extended me a couple of times already,” Dr. Tamesis said.“They were still asking if I wanted. I said it was time for me to go. So you have to listen to that voice inside of you that says, okay, maybe it’s time for you to go. You might not be bringing in enough juice anymore,” he added.Now having made the commitment to help reinvigorate Asian Hospital, Dr. Tamesis said, “My Leadership team and I are fully committed and engaged to ensure that ALL the stakeholders (patients, doctors, nurses, technologists, back office employees, etc) are engaged, their voices heard, as we plot the path forward to exciting growth in our service offerings, continually improving the patient journey and experience ofAsian Hospital, as we move briskly into the 21st century while honoring the Legacy of our Founders, and past leaders. So yes, exciting times ahead!”"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/20/medical-social-workers-provide-vital-support-to-filipino-healthcare-with-quality-patient-services/,Medical social workers provide vital support to Filipino healthcare with quality patient services,"Medical Social Workers were first introduced to the Philippine healthcare system in 1954 by the Department of Health’s (DOH) Bureau of Hospitals (BOH) Circular No. 146, which mandated all the national, provincial, city, and emergency government hospitals develop a Medical Social Service Unit (MSSU). This was a response to the World Health Organization’s redefinition of what health is, which is the state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. “Circular No. 146 emphasized that social work in hospitals is recognized as an essential service to medical care in fully understanding the causes that initiate, perpetuate or aggravate the illness,” explains Madeliene Gabrielle M. Doromal, an advisor of MSW.Since then, Medical Social Workers have actively helped many Filipinos have access to the healthcare services that they need. During the pandemic, Doromal says that medical social work was still focused on the provision of psychosocial support, even when this was challenged by their inability to provide face-to-face services.“Social Work Counseling was done over the phone. Their navigating and referral skills were much utilized, they facilitated the return of patients to their homes which required coordinating with multiple LGUs, and coordinating transport. They facilitated the cremation of the patients through the LGUs. They were utilized to provide Psychosocial Processing of Healthcare Providers who rendered duty in the Covid-19 Wards. They also facilitated the requirements for PhilHealth reimbursement on behalf of the patients.”The country’s Medical Social Workers join the Department of Health’s celebration of World Social Work Day on March 21, 2023. The objective of the celebration is to promote the contributions of the profession to individuals, families, communities, and wider society. In line with the international theme, ‘Respecting Diversity through Social Action’. “The highlight of the activity will be a forum where medical social workers will share stories of their good practices of interventions that demonstrate the given theme. One such story is that of a mother whose anxiety about her son’s medical condition was relieved after they both underwent consultation with a medical social worker,” Doromal says. The field of Medical Social Work is evolving, she adds. “It is moving toward clinical specialization that would recognize their competencies in psychosocial assessment and interventions, and their integration into medical care treatment.”The BusinessMirror provides readers with a broader look at today’s business in these challenging times.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/16/unprotected-sex-is-the-leading-cause-of-hiv-in-the-phl-doh/,Unprotected sex is the leading cause of HIV in the PHL—DOH,"If you think you have been exposed to the HIV virus, Department of Health officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said that it is important to get tested and to start treatment.“If you think that you have engaged in risky behavior, get yourself tested for HIV. The test and treatment for HIV is free. All you have to do is to go to your local governments,” Vergeire said.The DOH said that HIV is a viral infection that attacks and slowly destroys the immune system of the infected person that leads to “immune deficiency.”It is progressive and can lead to the lack of body defense to all kinds of infection including those that don’t normally infect people and can also lead to cancer susceptibility.Vergeire said that unprotected sex remains to be the leading cause of the transmission of HIV in the country.“The most common cause ng HIV here in our country and even around the world is unsafe sex,” she said.Likewise, Vergeire said they are also looking at mobile dating apps that tend to influence risky sexual behaviors.This is aside from lack of awareness and peer pressure, she said.The DOH said that based in the HIV/AIDS Registry in January, of the 1,454 new HIV cases, 79 were adolescents aged 10 to 19 years old and seven were children less than 10 years old.The report stated that most of the adolescent cases acquired HIV through sexual contact. One case, however, had no data on the mode of transmission.The virus is passed on to another person through infected blood like blood stained needles/medical instrumentations, sexual contact between casual acquaintances or with strangers/multiple partners, or partners of infected OFW, sharing of needles among drug users or accidental needle pricking or trauma among health professionals, according to the DOH.HIV infected individuals can infect unsuspecting contacts because of their normal looking physique.The spread of the disease happens before identification of the disease is the most treacherous of all possibilities.Vergeire said that HIV is not a death sentence.“HIV is no longer a death sentence. It is not like before where people thought that HIV is a death sentence,” the DOH official said.“The medicines that you will be taking can maintain and sustain your life and you become productive for a very, very long time,” she added.In January, the DOH and the Philippine National AIDS Council (PNAC) had a strategic planning assembly to address the high number of cases of HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the country.Vergeire also assured that the DOH is committed to combat the discrimination and stigma associated with HIV.“Through this strategic planning, the actions to address the HIV crisis combined with factors that fuel the epidemic such as social and gender inequalities, stigma and discrimination, structural barriers that prevent equitable access of affected populations to prevention, treatment, and care, and challenges placed on health, non-health and community systems, will be harmonized and concretized,” Vergeire said.Image credits: Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

Because of this, the firm is strengthening its capability to make sure that it is providing them with products that meet international quality and reliability standards.“Quality is our key priority. Only products that meet our high-quality standards are delivered to retailers and customers,” said Di Yang, general manager at RELX International. By doing so, the company maintains stringent testing and quality standards that follow government benchmarks in markets where it operates and guidelines for e-cigarette products.With its unrelenting focus on quality while staying true to the brand’s “Super Smooth” promise, RELX has established five laboratories in China over a period of five years to produce the best products and create vaping experience that raise the bar for the quality, reliable and product experience for the industry. To meet international standards, all its products undergo various rigorous procedures for quality control (QC). So for each production and development stage, the process involves 58 inspection methods, 18 strict QC measures, and over 200 trials to guarantee consistency and reliability.RELX is very keen about the high-value ingredients that comprise its e-liquids. Other e-liquids available in the market, especially bogus ones and altered vaping tools, do not comply with regulated standards or ingredients’ list that do not match the contents on their packaging. Other than quality, honesty and transparency are important to ascertain if a product is good or bad.The firm has ensured the safety of consumers by using ingredients from the food industry, including vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol. The former is commonly used in baking and e-liquids to get a thicker consistency, as the latter is usually utilized to make bread or keep the e-liquid stable in different environments.IN order to give insights on the effects of e-cigarettes, RELX has also put up an exclusive e-cigarette bioscience laboratory in Shenzhen, China.This facility conducts research on the evaluation and comprehensive impact of vapor products. The lab also aims to provide global outlooks on the areas that need more long-term research, such as the actual harm reduction elements of e-cigarettes and other potential effects of vaping, especially to the user’s health.“For us, it is crucially important to increase our knowledge on the effects and mechanics involved with e-cigarettes to become a more trustworthy and better solution for existing smokers to successfully quit,” said Yang.“As the vaping industry is under a lot of scrutiny, we are committed to ensuring that our products are backed by technology. Our state-of-the-art production capabilities and bioscience laboratory will help us bring better and reliable alternatives,” he addedRoderick L.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/16/pharma-company-re-launches-guard-against-hpv-campaign/,Pharma company re-launches ‘Guard Against HPV’ campaign,"One of the most common causes of genital cancers is the human papillomavirus, or HPV.It infects a staggering 85 percent of sexually active men and women at least once in their lifetime.And while many experience no health problems, there are those that do develop HPV-related diseases—from distressing genital warts to life-threatening cancers.It is for that reason that MSD in the Philippines is re-launching Guard Against HPV, a campaign to raise awareness and encourage people to take the necessary steps to keep infections at bay, not just for themselves, but also for their significant others and the whole family.“HPV remains the most common sexually transmitted infection. Because it often shows no symptoms, people can spread it without realizing it,” explained Dr. Mary Ann Galang-Escalona, Country Medical Lead of MSD in the Philippines.She added, “What this means is that, for many infected people, they may already have passed it on to someone they care about—their partners. If it goes untreated, it can lead to cancer.”According to a 2019 report by the HPV Information Center, cervical cancer remains the third leading cancer killer among Filipino women. The study also says that HPV has caused virtually all of these cases.HPV is a large group of viruses that cause growths on the body. Some strains infect the skin, such as with common warts.Others infect mucous membranes or surfaces lining body parts that open outside, such as the genitals, anus, throat, and mouth. The latter is called genital HPV. This type can be transmitted via vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse, or rarely by genital to genital contact without actual sex.Genital HPV infects people in two ways. Low-risk HPV strains, such as HPV 6 and 11, are often benign, causing warts around the genital and anal area.On the other hand, high-risk HPV strains such as HPV 16 and 18 are cancerous. High-risk HPV strains that remain in the body for many years can cause changes in normal cells, turning them into abnormal cells and then into cancer when left untreated.An important step in guarding against HPV is immunization. In fact, health experts recommend HPV immunization to children as young as nine years old to protect them in later life.Parents are also encouraged to talk to their pediatricians and take advantage of school-based immunization programs for free shots.Currently, HPV immunization is given in public schools by the Department of Health for fourth grade female learners with parental consent.Health experts also recommend adults, both males and females, to get immunized. While adults may already be exposed to HPV, the vaccine may help lower their risk for new infections.This will allow them to take better care of their health while protecting others when they enter new relationships.“HPV and cancer don’t have to rob our loved ones of their future,” Galang-Escalona said. “Everyone deserves a future free from disease. Let’s create that future by making a commitment to keep our partners and families safe from HPV.”Learn more about HPV immunization by following the Guard Against HPV page on Facebook and @guardagainsthpv on Instagram.Image credits: Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

One of the highlights of the day’s celebration was the launch of the Asian Cardiovascular Institute’s new service offerings which include the Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) Clinic Services the Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing or CPET, and Cardio Oncology.The Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) Clinic offers the Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC), a regimen designed to promote growth of new supporting blood vessels to increase the arterial blood flow to the lower extremities, using the ArtAssist® device. PAD is a condition where the arteries in the legs narrow or become clogged, resulting in reduced blood flow. These blockages can be dangerous because they restrict circulation to the limbs and organs.The Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) is a specialized type of stress test or exercise test that measures your exercise ability. Information about the heart and lungs is collected to understand if the body’s response to exercise is normal or abnormal.In Cardio Oncology, the heart needs to be taken cared of during and after cancer treatment. Adverse effects on the heart may be avoided by consulting a cardiologist and an oncologist.The Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists (AMFPA) of the Philippines mounted an art exhibit at the hospital lobby from February 21 to 24, 2023. Proceeds from the sale of the paintings will go to the AMFPA and the Asian Hospital Charities Inc. The day ended with the entire Asian Hospital community participating in “Talented Hearts,” a song and dance competition that featured Asian Hospital talents. A total of P125,000 worth of paintings were sold at the exhibit.An online symposium was held on February 22, 2023 with the title “Heart-to-Heart Talk: Raising Awareness on Innovative Cardiovascular Care.” Guest speakers included Dr. Fabio Enrique B. Posas, Head of Asian Hospital’s Structural Heart Disease and Endovascular Therapy, who spoke about “Minimally Invasive Procedure for Structural and Vascular Heart Disease,” and Dr. Eduardo O. Yambao, Head of Preventive Cardiology and Cardiac Rehabilitation, who tackled “Overview of Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing.” The online webinar was well attended by doctors, nurses and allied medical staff.PROBABLY the highlight of the Heart Month Celebration is the dedication and renaming of Asian Hospital’s Operating Room Complex to “Dr. Jorge M. Garcia Surgical Suites” to celebrate the man who embodies what Asian Hospital is and will be in the future.Dr. Garcia, together with his family, were on hand to witness the unveiling of the brass marker and signage also on February 21, to honor his contribution to nation building and his desire to build Asian Hospital for patients and the communities that it serves.Leading the dedication ceremony were Dr. Beaver R. Tamesis, Asian Hospital’s President and CEO, and Dr. Jose M. Acuin, the hospital’s Chief Medical Officer.February is also National Dental Health Month and this year’s theme is “Ngiping Protektado, Ngiting Panalo.” To celebrate this, Asian Hospitals’ Department of Dental Medicine, headed by its chairman Dr. Peachy Tala-Sunico, together with Asian Charities Inc., conducted a Dental Medicine Mission last February 22, 2023 at the Marillac Hills National Training School for Girls.The goal of the outreach program is to raise awareness on the importance of oral health. In addition to the health talk, there were games with prizes for lucky winners and food packs for participants."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/16/us-pregnancy-deaths-dropped-in-2022-after-covid-spike/,"US pregnancy deaths dropped in 2022, after COVID spike","NEW YORK (AP) — Deaths of pregnant women in the U.S. fell in 2022, dropping significantly from a six-decade high during the pandemic, new data suggests.More than 1,200 U.S. women died in 2021 during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth, according to a final tally released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2022, there were 733 maternal deaths, according to preliminary agency data, though the final number is likely to be higher.Officials say the 2022 maternal death rate is on track to get close to pre-pandemic levels. But that’s not great: The rate before COVID-19 was the highest it had been in decades.“From the worst to the near worst? I wouldn’t exactly call that an accomplishment,” said Omari Maynard, a New Yorker whose partner died after childbirth in 2019.The CDC counts women who die while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth. Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes.COVID-19 can be particularly dangerous to pregnant women, and experts believe it was the main reason for the 2021 spike. Burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women’s worries, some advocates said.In 2021, there were about 33 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births. The last time the government recorded a rate that high was 1964.What happened “isn’t that hard to explain,” said Eugene Declercq, a long-time maternal mortality researcher at Boston University. “The surge was COVID-related.” concluded that one quarter of maternal deaths in 2020 and 2021 were COVID-related — meaning that the entire increase in maternal deaths was due to coronavirus infections or the pandemic’s wider impact on health care. Pregnant women infected with the coronavirus were nearly 8 times as likely to die as their uninfected peers, according to a published by BMJ Global Health.The bodies of pregnant women are already under strain, their heart forced to pump harder. Other health problems can make their condition more fragile. And then on top of that, “COVID is going to make all that much worse,” said Dr. Elizabeth Cherot, chief medical and health officer for the March of Dimes.It didn’t help that vaccination rates among pregnant women were disappointingly low in 2021 — particularly among Black women. Part of that was related to limited vaccine availability, and that the CDC did not fully recommend shots for pregnant women until August 2021.“Initially there was a lot of mistrust of the vaccine in Black communities,” said Samantha Griffin, who owns a doula service that mainly serves families of color in the Washington, D.C., area.But there’s to more to it than that, she and others added. The 2021 maternal mortality rate for Black women was nearly three times higher than it was for white women. And the maternal death rate for Hispanic American women that year rose 54% compared with 2020, also surpassing the death rate for white moms.More than a year into the pandemic, a lot of doctors and nurses were feeling burned out and they were getting less in-person time with patients.Providers at the time “were needing to make snap decisions and maybe not listening to their patients as much,” Griffin said. “Women were saying that they thought something was wrong and they weren’t being heard.”Maynard, who is 41 and lives in Brooklyn, said he and his partner experienced that in 2019.Shamony Gibson, a healthy 30-year-old, was set to have their second child. The pregnancy was smooth until her contractions stopped progressing and she underwent a cesarean section.The operation was more involved than expected but their son Khari was born in September. A few days later, Shamony began complaining of chest pains and shortness of breath, Maynard said. Doctors told her she just needed to relax and let her body rest from the pregnancy, he said.More than a week after giving birth, her health worsened and she begged to go to the hospital. Then her heart stopped, and loved ones called for help. The initial focus for paramedics and firefighters was whether Gibson was taking illicit drugs, Maynard said, adding that she didn’t.She was hospitalized and died the next day of a blood clot in the lungs. Her son was 13 days old.“She wasn’t being heard at all,” said Maynard, an artist who now does speaking engagements as a maternal health advocate.Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/15/obesity-is-a-complex-issue-requiring-social-support/,Obesity is a complex issue requiring social support,"March 4 is World Obesity Day, as designated by the World Obesity Federation, the global organization focused exclusively on obesity. While previous World Obesity Days have covered information and understanding, this year’s campaign theme is ‘Changing Perspectives: Let’s Talk About Obesity’, aiming for correcting misconceptions surrounding obesity and taking effective, collective action.That last point – collective action – is of crucial importance, as obesity is far more than simply an issue for individuals, readily solved by the simplistic mantra, “eat less, move more”. You only have to glance at the shelves in supermarkets and convenience stores, check restaurant menu items, and note the advertisements we are bombarded with every day to appreciate obesity is all too often an outcome of modern life.Obesity is on the rise globally. The World Obesity Foundation notes that in 2020, nearly 1 billion people were living with obesity – which is 1 in 7 people. The numbers are projected to rise, so that by 2035 almost 1 in 4 people may be living with obesity. This in turn has profound health implications, as obesity is associated with conditions like hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for the major causes of death (cardiovascular diseases).Worse still, a significant number of consumers reported gaining weight as a result of unhealthy lifestyle habits adopted during the pandemic in the last two years, according to our Personal Habits Survey conducted in the Asia Pacific region. Among these individuals, 51% put on three to five kilograms, while 21% added six to 10 kilograms. Ideally, to shed the extra pounds, people need to have better diets, with less processed food and more fruits and vegetables, along with protein; and get around 45 minutes of exercise every day. Yet this proves easier said than done. For instance, data on gyms has revealed that while people may sign up with good intentions, few of them persist in using them on a regular basis. However, if you can surround yourself with a supportive community of like-minded people – who likewise want to live a healthy active lifestyle, you can significantly increase the odds of reaching your goals. A study published in the found that people who regularly walk in groups have lower blood pressure, resting heart rate, and total cholesterol.Indeed, social support can make a difference when trying to lead a healthier life. Social support comes in various forms. For instance, family and friends can provide motivation and encouragement, along with inspiration when challenges and obstacles occur. Some people provide assistance with day-to-day activities, such as giving each other a ride to the gym, or preparing nutritious meals together. Plus, people may share information on health and fitness, encouraging one another to adopt and keep to dietary or exercise routines. And when exercising in groups, people tend to also learn new moves or techniques and tend to work harder, with a greater than when exercising alone.At Herbalife Nutrition, we’ve seen first-hand how participation in social groups can be pivotal in helping people establish nutrition or fitness regimes, as the peer support empowers them to lead healthier lifestyles. This is chiefly through experiences gained with operated by our distributors, which bring together people who have similar wellness goals, contributing to a sense of community and a friendly, social environment.Many of our distributors also offer group fitness activities. Often referred to as Fit Clubs, these locations provide customers the option to participate in group exercise classes – inside the club premises or outdoors.In this environment, losing weight becomes easier. With a community for support, guidance and encouragement, people are more committed to their weight loss journeys, sticking to their wellness routines longer and remaining enthusiastic about them.World Obesity Day is not a day for despair, but a date to recognize – once and for all – there is a massive epidemic, and we all need to work together to get it under control. Together with our distributors, we are committed to helping address this global public health issue through sharing better knowledge and better nutrition, and building healthy communities."

However, more than sanitizing hands and keeping surroundings clean, the most crucial first step is making sure kids are healthy on the inside because 70% of the body’s immunity comes from the gut.“The gut affects so much of a child’s body: their mood, their reasoning, their behavior, and of course their overall health,” said J Ann Mirasol, from the makers of Erceflora Kiddie. “Erceflora Kiddie is created to help balance the good bacteria in the gut, allowing it to absorb nutrients, resist harmful microbes, and prevent upset stomachs.”To help parents understand the importance of gut health and make building healthy habits easier and more fun for their kids, Erceflora Kiddie created the Batang Matatag Bus, a touring bus across the metro meaning to make education on gut health for kids fun and simple. “Kids with a healthy gut are healthier, happier, and more energetic, and that’s what we call ‘Batang Matatag’,” said Mirasol.The Batang Matatag Bus was parked at the BGC Amphitheater from March 11-12 to set up the Todo Tatag Playground that had activities for the whole family:The Todo Tatag Playground featured different play areas that highlighted key information on how a healthy gut supports the overall development of children. Playground equipment were turned into exciting learning opportunities for all kids to be strong, healthy, and become Hopping onto the Todo Tatag Bus, kids learned the Todo Tatag Technique to make washing hands a fun and effective activity.

Among adolescents aged 10 to 19, it increased from 10.7 to 13 percent from 2019 to 2022.With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, worsening climate crisis, and rising prices of consumer goods, vulnerable families have had less access to fresh food and safe, protected areas for play in recent years.UNICEF’s report, entitled “Children’s lived experience of the food environment,” revealed the reality of children’s lives and how the systems that drive malnutrition impact not only their diet and exercise, but also safety, hygiene, and financial security.“Malnutrition is a serious violation of a child’s right to adequate nutrition and can have serious long-term consequences for a child’s health, development, and well-being. Children need a varied and nutritious diet for their growth and development, and caregivers need support to provide their children with a healthy diet,” UNICEF Philippines Representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov said.The study accounted for over 100 children from lower-income families and localities, aged 6 months to 18 years. Here, UNICEF pinpointed the policies that the Philippines government and other stakeholders need to strengthen to provide children with better access to healthier diets and living conditions. These included several recommendations to improve more children’s “food environments.” These ranged from restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy food and making local produce more affordable, to infrastructure which can ensure ready access to fresh food and potable water in communities—proving the need for a comprehensive, multi-sector approach to support the growth and development of children in the country."

Pfizer then plans to let the biotech drug developer “continue innovating,” except with more resources than it would have alone, Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla told analysts.“We are not buying the golden eggs,” he said. “We are acquiring the goose that is laying the golden eggs.”Bothell, Washington-based Seagen Inc. specializes in working with antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, technology. Its key products use lab-made proteins called monoclonal antibodies that seek out cancer cells to help deliver a cancer-killing drug while sparing surrounding tissue.Cancer treatments are a priority for Pfizer. They brought in $12 billion in revenue for the drugmaker last year. But Pfizer has only marketed a couple first-generation ADC treatments, a spokeswoman said.Seagen has four treatments on the market. It also has a pipeline of drugs under development that includes potential treatments for a form of lung cancer and advanced breast cancer.“We think this really changes dramatically the oncology presence of Pfizer, makes it one of a kind,” Bourla said.Seagen’s top seller, Adcetris, treats lymph system cancers. It brought in $839 million in sales last year, a 19% increase over the previous year.Seagen also has a deal with Pfizer’s Array BioPharma to develop, make and sell the breast and colorectal cancer treatment Tukysa. It brought in $353 million in sales for Seagen last year.The company, which changed its name from Seattle Genetics in 2020, saw total revenue grow about 25% last year to nearly $2 billion. Seagen also shaved its loss to $610 million from $674 million in 2021.The drug developer predicts about $2.2 billion in sales for this year.Pfizer booked about $100 billion in total revenue last year and has been flush with cash thanks to sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and treatment, Comirnaty and Paxlovid.Bourla said earlier this year that the company planned to use its “extraordinary firepower” to buy products that will deliver $25 billion in incremental revenue by 2030.The deal announced Monday and some previous acquisitions will help Pfizer account for most of that. But Bourla emphasized on Monday that the company expects Seagen’s contributions to extend beyond the end of the decade.New York-based Pfizer Inc. has already spent $11.6 billion on migraine treatment developer Biohaven Pharmaceutical. It also spent $5.4 billion on sickle cell disease treatment maker Global Blood Therapeutics and bought Arena Pharmaceuticals for another $6.7 billion.The drugmaker needs more revenue sources in part because it faces the expiration of patents protecting drugs like its breast cancer treatment Ibrance from cheaper competition in the coming years.Pfizer said Monday it will pay for Seagen mostly through $31 billion in new, long-term debt.Both companies’ boards have unanimously approved the deal. But regulators still need to look at it, and Seagen shareholders will have to approve it.The companies expect to complete the transaction in late 2023 or early 2024.Shares of Pfizer rose 2% to $40.26 after markets opened Monday, while Seagen’s stock soared more than 15% to nearly $200.

Yet most people have resumed their normal lives, thanks to a wall of immunity built from infections and vaccines.The virus appears here to stay, along with the threat of a more dangerous version sweeping the planet.“New variants emerging anywhere threaten us everywhere,” said virus researcher Thomas Friedrich of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “Maybe that will help people to understand how connected we are.”With information sources drying up, it has become harder to keep tabs on the pandemic. Johns Hopkins University on Friday shut down , which it started soon after the virus and spread worldwide.Saturday since the World Health Organization first called the outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and the United Nation’s health organization says it’s to say the emergency has ended.A look at where we stand:With the pandemic still killing 900 to 1,000 people a day worldwide, the stealthy virus behind COVID-19 hasn’t lost its punch. It spreads easily from person to person, riding respiratory droplets in the air, killing some victims but leaving most to bounce back without much harm.“Whatever the virus is doing today, it’s still working on finding another winning path,” said Dr. Eric Topol, head of Scripps Research Translational Institute in California.We’ve become numb to the daily death toll, Topol says, but we should view it as too high. Consider that in the United States, daily hospitalizations and deaths, while lower than at the worst peaks, have not yet dropped to the low levels reached during summer 2021 before the delta variant wave.At any moment, the virus could change to become more transmissible, more able to sidestep the immune system or more deadly. Topol said we’re not ready for that. Trust has eroded in public health agencies, furthering an exodus of public health workers. Resistance to stay-at-home orders and vaccine mandates may be the pandemic’s legacy.“I wish we united against the enemy — the virus — instead of against each other,” Topol said.There’s another way to look at it. Humans unlocked the virus’ genetic code and rapidly developed vaccines that work remarkably well. We built mathematical models to get ready for worst-case scenarios. We continue to monitor how the virus is changing by looking for it in wastewater.“The pandemic really catalyzed some amazing science,” said Friedrich.The achievements add up to a new normal where COVID-19 “doesn’t need to be at the forefront of people’s minds,” said Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at Emory University. “That, at least, is a victory.”Dr. Stuart Campbell Ray, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins, said the current omicron variants have about 100 genetic differences from the original coronavirus strain. That means about 1% of the virus’ genome is different from its starting point. Many of those changes have made it more contagious, but the worst is likely over because of population immunity.Matthew Binnicker, an expert in viral infections at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said the world is in “a very different situation today than we were three years ago — where there was, in essence, zero existing immunity to the original virus.”That extreme vulnerability forced measures aimed at “flattening the curve.” Businesses and schools closed, weddings and funerals were postponed. Masks and “social distancing” later gave way to showing proof of vaccination. Now, such precautions are rare.“We’re not likely to go back to where we were because there’s so much of the virus that our immune systems can recognize,” Ray said. Our immunity should protect us “from the worst of what we saw before.”On Friday, Johns Hopkins did its final update to its free coronavirus dashboard and hot-spot map with the death count standing at more than 6.8 million worldwide. Its government sources for real-time tallies had drastically declined. In the U.S., only New York, Arkansas and Puerto Rico still publish case and death counts daily.“We rely so heavily on public data and it’s just not there,” said Beth Blauer, data lead for the project.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still collects a variety of information from states, hospitals and testing labs, including cases, hospitalizations, deaths and what strains of the coronavirus are being detected. But for many counts, there’s less data available now and it’s been less timely.“People have expected to receive data from us that we will no longer be able to produce,” said the CDC’s director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky.Internationally, the WHO’s tracking of COVID-19 relies on individual countries reporting. Global health officials have been voicing concern that their numbers severely underestimate what’s actually happening and they do not have a true picture of the outbreak.For more than year, CDC has been moving away from case counts and testing results, partly because of the rise in home tests that aren’t reported. The agency focuses on hospitalizations, which are still reported daily, although that may change. Death reporting continues, though it has become less reliant on daily reports and more on death certificates — which can take days or weeks to come in.US officials say they are adjusting to the circumstances, and trying to move to a tracking system somewhat akin to how CDC monitors the flu.“I wish we could go back to before COVID,” said Kelly Forrester, 52, of Shakopee, Minnesota, who lost her father to the disease in May 2020, survived her own bout in December and blames misinformation for ruining a longtime friendship. “I hate it. I actually hate it.”The disease feels random to her. “You don’t know who will survive, who will have long COVID or a mild cold. And then other people, they’ll end up in the hospital dying.”Forrester’s father, 80-year-old Virgil Michlitsch, a retired meat packer, deliveryman and elementary school custodian, died in a nursing home with his wife, daughters and granddaughters keeping vigil outside the building in lawn chairs.Not being at his bedside “was the hardest thing,” Forrester said.Inspired by the pandemic’s toll, her 24-year-old daughter is now getting a master’s in public health.“My dad would have been really proud of her,” Forrester said. “I’m so glad that she believed in it, that she wanted to do that and make things better for people.”___"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/12/prostate-cancer-treatment-can-wait-for-most-men-study-finds/,"Prostate cancer treatment can wait for most men, study finds","Researchers have found long-term evidence that actively monitoring localized prostate cancer is a safe alternative to immediate surgery or radiation.The results, released Saturday, are encouraging for men who want to avoid treatment-related sexual and incontinence problems, said Dr. Stacy Loeb, a prostate cancer specialist at NYU Langone Health who was not involved in the research.The study directly compared the three approaches — surgery to remove tumors, radiation treatment and monitoring. Most prostate cancer grows slowly, so it takes many years to look at the disease’s outcomes.“There was no difference in prostate cancer mortality at 15 years between the groups,” Loeb said. And prostate cancer survival for all three groups was high — 97% regardless of treatment approach. “That’s also very good news.”The results were published Saturday in the and presented at a European Association of Urology conference in Milan, Italy. Britain’s National Institute for Health and Care Research paid for the research.Men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer shouldn’t panic or rush treatment decisions, said lead author Dr. Freddie Hamdy of the University of Oxford. Instead, they should “consider carefully the possible benefits and harms caused by the treatment options.”A small number of men with high-risk or more advanced disease do need urgent treatments, he added.Researchers followed more than 1,600 UK men who agreed to be randomly assigned to get surgery, radiation or active monitoring. The patients’ cancer was confined to the prostate, a walnut-sized gland that’s part of the reproductive system. Men in the monitoring group had regular blood tests and some went on to have surgery or radiation.Death from prostate cancer occurred in 3.1% of the active-monitoring group, 2.2% in the surgery group, and 2.9% in the radiation group, differences considered statistically insignificant.At 15 years, cancer had spread in 9.4% of the active-monitoring group, 4.7% of the surgery group and 5% of the radiation group. The study was started in 1999, and experts said today’s monitoring practices are better, with MRI imaging and gene tests guiding decisions.“We have more ways now to help catch that the disease is progressing before it spreads,” Loeb said. In the US, about 60% of low-risk patients choose monitoring, now called active surveillance.Hamdy said the researchers had seen the difference in cancer spread at 10 years and expected it to make a difference in survival at 15 years, “but it did not.” He said spread alone doesn’t predict prostate cancer death.“This is a new and interesting finding, useful for men when they make decisions about treatments,” he said.___Image credits:"

We are also experiencing a shift in our climate– bidding farewell to the cold ‘ber’ months and saying hello to warmer days ahead. This shift in season can trigger different kinds of health conditions like flu, colds, and even sore throat. Luckily, if there is one thing that the almost three-year pandemic taught us, it is that we should always be ready to face head on different health challenges. The threat of sore throat progressing to something more serious is still very much present—whether it be COVID-19 related or not, which is why Hexetidine (Bactidol), as an industry leader for therapeutic mouthwash, aims to remind all sore-throat sufferers to protect themselves with Hexetidine (Bactidol), even at the first signs of sore throat, so their conditions do not worsen.When the start of the itchy and dry throat feeling arrives, one can only do so much with home remedies. Instead, an ideal solution is gargling with an oral antiseptic like Hexetidine (Bactidol), so our throat can always be protected from viruses, germs, and bacteria.“Hexetidine (Bactidol) Gargle contains hexetidine, a well-researched broad-spectrum antibacterial and antiviral antiseptic that gives protection against sore throat.

Atayde their present plans and what is needed to improve their respective hospitals.“It’s a fruitful discussion between us and the hospital administrators, so in a few days, we can prepare the supplies that we can give to our cancer patients and the hospitals. This is part of my advocacy to provide medical assistance to the people of our district and others as well,” he said.The BusinessMirror provides readers with a broader look at today’s business in these challenging times.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/10/ensure-gold-plant-based-oral-nutritional-supplement-enhances-everyday-strength/,Ensure Gold plant-based oral nutritional supplement enhances everyday strength,"Abbott announced today that Filipinos who consume a plant-based diet now have another option to help them become stronger and healthier with Ensure Gold Plant-Based, Abbott’s first plant-based nutrition solution available in the Philippines. The science-based formula offers a dairy alternative suitable for older adults including those who have non-dairy dietary preferences or lactose intolerance.The oral nutrition supplement contains Ensure’s same scientifically driven formulation with HMB, and now includes a plant-based, high-quality triple protein blend made of soy, rice, and quinoa for muscle health; 28 vitamins and minerals for immunity; and omega-3 and omega-6 for heart health.“Scientific evidence shows that a plant-based diet correlates with improvement in cardiovascular and overall health. This may explain why more Filipinos seek plant-based diets to improve their well-being,” said Dr. Jose Rodolfo Dimaano, Jr., Medical Director of Abbott’s nutrition business in Pacific Asia.Research has demonstrated the health advantages of consuming plant-based foods. However, these foods can contain lower amounts of protein than animal-based foods and tend to be less calorie dense. This means that adults may need to eat more to meet their daily needs.“Plant-based diets provide many benefits but may not deliver the right amount of nutrients to help older adults sustain their body functions and protect their muscle and immune health,”said Dr. Dimaano. “People eating less diversified sources of protein may show more signs of low muscle mass, loss of strength, and waning immunity due to age. Oral nutritional supplements with plant-based protein concentrates can help fill nutritional gaps.” More Filipinos are choosing plant-based diets. According to a recent survey, nearly 40% of Filipino respondents consume plant-based food weekly, and more than 50% consider plant-based food as a healthier option. These numbers are expected to grow even further as more Filipinos look for alternatives to help them become stronger and healthier.“Older adults need good nutrition to help maintain their strength, support their immune health, prevent disease, and facilitate recovery from illness,” said Dr. Dimaano. “That is why Abbott develops science-based nutrition solutions – like Ensure Gold Plant-Based – to help meet a variety of dietary preferences and help more Filipino older adults improve their quality of life through everyday strength.”Ensure Gold Plant-Based, which comes in an almond flavor, can be found nationwide at most major retailers and online.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/09/seek-immediate-medical-attention-for-animal-bites-to-avoid-death-by-rabies/,Seek immediate medical attention for animal bites to avoid death by rabies,"Every month of March is celebrated as Rabies Awareness Month.The Department of Health (DOH) said rabies is a human infection that occurs after a transdermal bite or scratch by an infected animal, like dogs and cats. It can be transmitted when infectious material, usually saliva, comes into direct contact with a victim’s fresh skin lesions.Rabies may also occur, though in very rare cases, through inhalation of virus-containing spray or through organ transplants.RABIES is considered to be a neglected disease, which is 100 percent fatal though 100 percent preventable. It is not among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the country but it is regarded as a significant public health problem because it is one of the most acutely fatal infections and it is responsible for the death of 200 to 300 Filipinos annually.DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said that 43 cases of rabies were recorded from January 1 to February 18 this year. All were fatalities, according to Vergeire.“ 43 rabies . These are animal bite cases,” she said in a media forum on March 7.This figure, she said, is lower by 4 percent as compared with the same period in 2022.Data from the DOH’s epidemiology bureau showed that rabies had a case fatality rate of 100 percent.THE DOH said that the first symptoms of rabies are similar to those of the flu such as general weakness or discomfort, fever, and headache. As the rabies virus incubates inside the body, the person may experience an itching sensation around the bite area and symptoms of cerebral dysfunction such as anxiety, confusion, and agitation.Patients will later experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, hydrophobia, and insomnia as the disease progresses.Meanwhile, dogs infected with the rabies virus develop the following symptoms then die within 10 days:THE incubation period takes two to three months as the rabies virus travels from the bite area to the central nervous system. There are exceptional cases where incubation only lasts two to three days or can take as long as six months.If you are bitten by an animal, immediately wash the bite or scratch area and apply iodine-containing medication on the wound. Confine the dog or animal for observation and report the circumstances of the bite to a health-care professional. Not all animal bites require rabies specific treatment, but if the dog exhibits symptoms of the virus or its background is unknown (i.e. the dog is a stray), the person must get a rabies vaccine or post-exposure prophylaxis. Should the dog remain healthy after 10 days, it is still best to take the rabies vaccine preventively, known as pre-exposure prophylaxis.A post-exposure prophylaxis or PEP is the administration of the rabies vaccine to a person after being exposed to the rabies virus. In countries where rabies is endemic, like the Philippines, it is necessary for a person to undergo PEP immediately after an animal bite, regardless of the health of the animal in question.A pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP , on the other hand, is the administration of the rabies vaccine before exposure to the rabies virus. It is recommended for individuals whose work puts them at a higher risk of animal bites or whose circumstances limit their ability to seek immediate medical attention.The DOH reminds the public that once clinical symptoms begin to develop, rabies is almost always fatal. There is currently no effective medication for patients who have entered this stage of the disease, the DOH said.DOGS cause almost all cases of rabies in humans. As such, vaccinating at least 70 percent of dogs in places where rabies is endemic will break the transmission of the disease.Training dogs to socialize with people properly will contribute in minimizing the transmission of rabies by preventing animal bites altogether. Avoiding stray dogs will also keep chances of catching rabies in the community low.Image credits: Claudeth Mocon-Ciriaco is a grant recipient and fellow of 2017 media fellowship program by Probe Media Foundation Inc.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/09/ac-health-shares-vision-of-providing-more-affordable-cancer-care-in-the-country/,AC Health shares vision of providing more affordable cancer care in the country,"Cancer is now the third leading cause of death in the Philippines and its costly treatment regimens impose a heavy burden on patients and their families.“For many years, cancer has been one of the leading causes of death in the country. Sadly, Filipino families, even those in the upper-income brackets, are vulnerable to catastrophic health spending due to high treatment costs and limited coverage of cancer care under public programs,” said Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Secretary Amenah F. Pangandaman during the recent Philippine National Cancer Summit.DBM has released the 2023 Cancer Assistance Fund (CAF) amounting to P500 million to the Department of Health (DOH). The CAF aims to complement and supplement existing financial support mechanisms for various cancer care and control services that are not yet covered by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation and only partially covered by the Malasakit Program.While there are government funds and public and private organizations offering financial aid to cancer patients, these may not be enough considering the number of cases and high cost of cancer treatment.RECOGNIZING this problem, AC Health President and CEO Paolo Borromeo shared how AC Health continues to work with like-minded partners, such as Siemens Healthineers and Varian, to help realize the Healthway Cancer Care Hospital’s vision of providing more affordable oncology care in the country.AC Health’s Healthway Cancer Care Hospital, the country’s first dedicated cancer hospital, is set to open by the third quarter of this year.“Our goal is to offer the best value private hospital for cancer care. We are working with our partners to ensure that our cancer hospital will provide very competitive rates for diagnostics, radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery to a broader base of Filipino patients,” said Borromeo.Borromeo was one of the speakers during the cancer summit held on February 23 and 24 at Crowne Plaza Galleria, Quezon City. The event was organized by the Philippine College of Surgeons – Cancer Commission Foundation to rally stakeholders in the battle against cancer.DRAWING from AC Health’s experience in putting up the country’s first dedicated cancer hospital, Borromeo spoke about the importance of collaboration between the public and private sectors in bridging the cancer care gap in the Philippines.“I am a big believer that the private and public sectors should work hand-in-hand towards improving oncology care here in the Philippines. In no other industry is collaboration more evident than in health care, as we saw firsthand during the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Borromeo.In the special panel discussion, “A Closer Look at Cancer Centers,” AC Health Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Maria Carissa Alejandro further elaborated on interventions in reducing the cost of cancer care and how these can be applied in building the country’s first dedicated cancer hospital.“Health services need to go beyond pricing and focus on creating greater value for patients. We hope that the Healthway Cancer Care Hospital will serve as a model for more affordable cancer care in the Philippines,” said Alejandro.AC Health executives said the Healthway Cancer Care Hospital has reached 75 percent completion and is set to open in the third quarter of this year in Taguig City. It will be the first comprehensive and dedicated cancer hospital in the country, offering a complete range of cancer services, from screening, diagnosis, treatment, to post-cancer care. Equipped with 18 chemotherapy infusion units, two linear accelerators (LINACs), and all the essential diagnostic and imaging machines, the hospital will be focused on improving overall patient experience and enabling multidisciplinary cancer care."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/09/early-diagnosis-intervention-can-help-combat-dengue-expert/,"Early diagnosis, intervention can help combat dengue–expert","THOUGH already seen as endemic in the Philippines, dengue continues to be a serious threat to the health—and lives—of many people all over the world. Over the last 50 years, the incidence of dengue has increased 30-fold and has expanded its reach to more countries, with an estimated 100 to 400 million infections recorded annually, though 80 percent of them are seen as mild and asymptomatic.Despite it being endemic already in the country, there are still dengue cases that become severe thereby causing deaths. This disease, transmitted by infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, will not go away, so what’s critical in avoiding dengue deaths are proper diagnosis, early intervention and clinical management, especially at its onset in the first few days.DR. Rontgene Solante, Chairman of the Adult Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine section of the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, said during the recent Stop C.O.V.I.D. Deaths webinar titled “Nakakamatay Ba Ang Dengue? Update on Clinical Management of Dengue” organized by the University of the Philippines, the UP Manila NIH National Telehealth Center and UP Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) that the country has always been a country considered as a threat for any increase in the number of dengue cases.He said transmission has been documented all year round and even before 2003 up to 2013. During the rainy season, cases will be higher than expected. The Department of Health (DOH) said anyone is vulnerable, and the highly vulnerable ones are those 25 years and below.Dr. Solante said in 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) mentioned that the Philippines is one of those countries with the highest number of dengue cases during its 2019 surveillance report, with higher mortality and higher case fatality rate. “The WHO’s initial report in 2018 said one of the major gaps is the delay in the institution of appropriate therapeutic modalities. Overhydration among patients was also one of the causes of mortality. The DOH released an administrative order to update and form an informed standardized protocol for doctors, whether in private or government facilities in the diagnosis and treatments of dengue,” Dr. Solante pointed out.THE findings of the WHO Dengue Mission Activity in the Philippines in July 2018 revealed that the three most common causes of mortality are delay in presentation to the health care system resulting in delayed admission to tertiary centers where most of the time, patients are already in severe form of dengue, leading to delayed institution of appropriate rehydration, and delay in instituting appropriate rehydration measures in hospitalized patients, where there were gaps in fluid hydration; and fluid overload.The report, he said, also emphasized important measures for consideration to alter and decrease mortality of suspected dengue patients. These involved the early diagnosis and indication for admission, early detection of plasma leakage and time-sensitive institution of fluid rehydration, the investigation and correction of common complications in case patients do not respond to conventional IV fluid therapy, the early detection of bleeding and early blood transfusion, then early diagnosis in cases with unusual manifestations, especially those with encephalopathy or the presence of co-morbidity or other superimposed bacterial infections.HE ADDED that in 2020, the DOH formed a Technical Working Group to review some of these gaps in dengue management, one of which is the incorporation of innovative diagnostic modalities such as the Dengue NS1 antigen rapid diagnostic test. “This will somehow help us diagnose the patient with dengue and I think this has been implemented in the primary health care setting, that it should be readily available so that physicians will have a very good diagnostic tool to confirm it at the level of the primary care center.”Dr. Solante also cited a journal of infectious diseases regarding lessons learned in case management of dengue that listed a host of problems and proposed solutions when it comes to clinical management to reduce dengue Case Fatality Rate (CFR). Some of those problems include improper diagnosis and triage of dengue, to be solved by earlier recognition and clinical/laboratory diagnosis, improper recognition and management of plasma leakage, with optimal fluid management as a solution, improper recognition and management of bleeding, with optimal transfusion as possible solution, while complications of multiple organ failure can be solved through earlier recognition and management of severe dengue to avoid prolonged shock.“The key to dengue management has always been reducing mortality and morbidity by recognizing the disease phase the patient is experiencing. It is also essential that patients, parents or guardians, and clinicians are cognizant of the warning signs and symptoms. It is also important for clinicians to recognize early the presence of dengue and at the same time look for some of the warning signs that will somehow educate the patient and clinicians to anticipate so they should be appropriately managed,” he explained.# # #Image credits:"
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/06/biotin-wolvit-prevents-hair-loss-caused-by-biotin-deficiency/,Biotin (Wolvit) prevents hair loss caused by biotin deficiency,"A full head of hair is commonly associated with feminine allure or masculine appeal. No matter how it’s cut or styled, thick, smooth, and shiny tresses enhance a pretty face or lend a kind of charm to plain and homey ones. In fact, nothing gives the average man or woman a better confidence boost than a lush, well-styled mane.Thus, it can be quite distressing for anyone to note signs of early hair loss, such as regular shedding of hair in the shower or waking up to find significant amounts of hair strands on one’s pillow.Providentially, before all these lead to the more visually upsetting stage such as a “receding hairline,” there is a product that’s formulated to help restore the thickness of your hair and prevent serious hair loss: Biotin (Wolvit®).Biotin is a key part of the body’s protein synthesis, especially in keratin production. Keratin is the most important protein that the body needs to produce and maintain healthy hair and skin—plus better nail growth.In a study published in the Skin Appendage Disorders journal, it was found that common afflictions resulting from biotin deficiency include alopecia, eczematous skin rashes, seborrheic dermatitis, conjunctivitis, and more. This often manifests as excessive hair loss, brittle nails, or dry skin.These are conditions that may produce an emotional toll on the afflicted, as well. After all, excessive hair loss can cause your self-confidence and self-esteem to plunge, and feelings of insecurity to set in.Marco Elmer Manus, Group Product Manager at Kusum Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. Brand Office, spoke on how Biotin (Wolvit®) helps those suffering from biotin deficiency. “The signs of biotin deficiency can be difficult to deal with,” said Manus. “One starts to worry about their health and lose confidence in their looks. it’s disquieting! That’s why we want to tell everyone, ‘Hey, relax! There are things you can do. A good diet, regular exercise, and taking Biotin (Wolvit®) will help.’”Manus asserts that there’s no need to be alarmed when hair loss starts setting in. A healthy lifestyle combined with Biotin (Wolvit®) provides the body the biotin it needs to produce healthy hair, skin, and nails.A study conducted by the Institute of Dermatology and Venereology of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine found that the use of Biotin (Wolvit®) “has positive effect on the structure of the skin and its appendages (hair, nails).” In a review of 18 cases—published in Skin Appendage Disorders—where biotin was used in response to hair loss, it was found that all showed evidence of clinical improvement.”All this gives hope to those suffering from hair loss caused by biotin deficiency.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/02/pioneering-micro-lending-app-to-help-finance-health-care-launched/,Pioneering micro lending app to help finance health care launched,"SURESERV, the first and only closed loop microfinance mobile app, has been launched to make health care accessible to more Filipinos, especially those who belong in the working-class sector.“Looking at the health-care situation in the Philippines, we’ve noticed some pain points. So we’d liked to cover three of the major problematic areas in health care,” SureServ Chief Executive Officer and Founder Johnny Bondoc said during their exclusive media kickoff event held recently in Quezon City.In relation to clinic services, he cited that only around 6 percent of Filipinos are covered by health maintenance organization (HMO) insurance. For the rest of those not covered by HMOs, they think that health services and tests are luxuries they simply cannot afford. “So this has led to the mindset that even if a doctor has prescribed a test, our will not undergo the test even if the test will detect some of the bad health conditions they suffer from. That’s because they do not have the means to pay for it,” he said.ANOTHER challenge that SureServ seeks to address is the inability of 99 percent of the population to purchase the complete set of prescription medicines due to budget unavailability, based on a report by the Department of Health in September 2019.Eventually, this has led to the “tingi” purchase of medicines, where those who have limited budget or no means at all are forced to buy only two to three days’ worth of antibiotics, rather than a supply good for seven to 14 days as the doctors prescribed. “This results in even bigger, more serious problems. One of which is the emergence of antibiotics resistant pathogens, bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics,” Bondoc explained.The low completion rate of the vaccination program for the newborns is also what the company wants to solve. A 2017 study done by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) shows that out of two million babies given birth annually, only five percent or about 107,000 are able to get all the 24 vaccine shots prescribed or recommended by the Philippine Pediatric Society, Inc. “Thankfully, they have the LGUs [local government units] to provide support to give the five major vaccine shots. But still the gap exists even among the working-class who are supposed to be comfortable and capable of providing all these vaccines,” he said.“But if the working-class accounts for 50 percent of our population, there stands to reason that around 50 percent of babies should be able to get all the vaccine shots prescribed. But sadly that’s not the case [per the GSK research],” he added.Turning the other side of the picture, SureServ also observed that the financial services sector is not exactly in the best state as well since 40 percent of the population have no physical access to banks, 75 percent without bank accounts outside of their payroll, and 90 percent to 95 percent sans credit card. In a 2019 financial service study sponsored by Union Bank together with Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, 54 percent of Filipinos’ borrowing are still being done through informal channels and lenders, families, friends, and the so-called 5-6 to make both ends meet and survive. Forty-eight percent of them are saying that it’s just too difficult to apply for a loan through formal channels, with 60 percent agree that the documentary requirements are the most difficult to comply with. “So with not much choice, we have a scenario where oppressive interest rates further oppress the oppressed, and the oppressive interest rates oppress them even more,” Bondoc pointed out. “Putting these two realities side-by-side—the health-care situation on one hand, and the financial services sector on the other hand—we have a scenario where the Filipino working-class is not able to fully avail of all the health-care services that they need and to fulfill all the healthcare needs. Sure, they’re hard working, they’re very deserving, but it’s just beyond their reach.”SINCE its conception in 2019 up to its proven application when the pandemic hit in 2020, SureServ has been finally introduced as a revolutionary microfinance mobile app for the health care.“I believe we’ve come up with something special—one that’s potentially a game-changing solution to the health-care and financial service issues confronting our kababayans today,” he said.This app initially focuses on corporate accounts or the employees coming from manpower agencies, manufacturing companies, and business process outsourcing firms who are mostly exposed to various health risks. They can use the health-care credit line that starts from P3,000 up to P8,000 to cover vaccines and doctors’ fees, clinic and hospital services, and pharmacy or drugstore purchases. Every 15th day, the members are required to pay at least P300 through salary deduction. The credit is revolving, such that every amount paid is added to the available balance. A 2.5-percent interest rate is applied every cutoff. “We want to help them the most to have a fighting chance to get their health-care needs and comfort. For purposes of progressing gradually and taking all of we can handle, then at this point, we really want to focus on corporate accounts—the employees—those who have the capacity to repay obligations,” he said while reiterating their willingness to also cater it to the open market to accommodate workers from other industries. “But by no means is it exclusive. We welcome any and all of the corporate accounts who desire to endorse their employees to become SureServ members.”CURRENTLY, SureServ has 100 accredited doctors, four clinic- and diagnostic laboratory-partners, one hospital-partner, and four online and brick-and-mortar pharmacy-partners. The company now has 47 service contracts with corporate merchants, covering 28,000 employees. Seeing a lot of opportunities in the market, Bondoc told the BusinessMirror in a sideline interview that they are still looking at growth areas in terms of their merchant-partners and members. By end of this year, he said that they are aiming to have 500 to 1,000 accredited doctors and 30,000 active members.“Of course, it can be 50,000 or 100,000 because our long-term goal is to have a million users in five years. But if we can bring it earlier why not?” he stressed. “We’ve certainly taken steps. At least, it’s not just a possibility anymore. It’s not ‘what if,’ or in the area of wondering. It’s already operational. It’s a reality. It’s actually an ongoing app that’s already serviceable.”Roderick L.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/03/02/doctors-warn-hypertension-can-be-deadly-may-show-no-symptoms/,"Doctors warn hypertension can be deadly, may show no symptoms","Most people look for warning signs of high blood pressure or hypertension like headaches, shortness of breath, or nosebleeds.Cardiologists however warn the public not to wait for symptoms because hypertension, considered as a silent killer, often does not present symptoms. And when it does, the condition may have already reached a severe or life-threatening stage. For this reason, it is important that blood pressure is measured regularly.“ fake news and facts about hypertension. Fake news—hypertension is always headache plus or minus pain or . Fact is maraming hypertensives symptoms. hypertensive silent killer. high blood pressure? check BP. rely symptoms [We have fake news and facts about hypertension. Fake news—hypertension is always headache plus or minus nape pain. Fact is many hypertensives have no symptoms. They don’t know they are hypertensive, that is why it is called a silent killer. How do you know that you have a high blood pressure? Get a blood pressure check and don’t just rely on symptoms.],” said Dr. Jude Erric Cinco, Cardiologist-Intensivist at The Medical City (TMC) and Assistant Professor at Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health (ASMPH).DRS. Cinco and Albert Hans Bautista, a specialist in Advanced Echocardiography and in Vascular Cardiology, talked about hypertension during a virtual lay forum dubbed “Heart Essentials” held last week in celebration of Heart Month at The Medical City Ortigas. The forum also tackled healthy heart tips and decoding diagnostics or the work-up for the cardiovascular system.Dr. Cinco reiterated that blood pressure numbers of less than 120/80 mm Hg are considered within the normal range. Borderline blood pressure is when readings consistently range from 120-139 systolic and 80-89 mm Hg diastolic. Hypertension is defined as blood pressure that consistently ranges at 140/90 mm Hg or higher. At this stage, cardiologists are likely to prescribe a combination of blood pressure medications and lifestyle changes.Dr. Bautista explained that a single reading of high blood pressure does not necessarily mean hypertension, citing factors like stress and diet. If one has a high reading, the doctor will want to see if it stays high over time or three or more times in a week before diagnosing high blood pressure. This makes regular blood pressure check or BP monitoring very important.Both doctors stressed that untreated high blood pressure increases the risk of heart attack, heart failure, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, and diabetes.“As far as high blood is concerned, organ [the organ most affected is the heart],” said Dr. Bautista.“Number one reaction ng puso sa high blood is heart enlargement or what we call Left Ventricular Hypertrophy or LVH. you have the risk of having a heart attack with four times the risk of dying. BP [Number one reaction of the heart to high blood is heart enlargement or what we call left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH. When the heart enlarges, you have the risk of having a heart attack with four times the risk of dying. Do not let your BP get too high or stay high for a long time],” he added.DR. BAUTISTA also said that with uncontrolled or untreated hypertension, the patient is also six times more likely to develop heart failure and seven times more likely to develop stroke.“If you have diabetes or high blood sugar, you have a 70 percent chance of developing hypertension in five years. Diabetes with high blood pressure can destroy blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, heart, and nerves,” he added.To diagnose high blood pressure, the doctor will check the patient’s BP (using a cuff, usually placed around the arm) and ask questions about signs and symptoms, lifestyle, family and medical history.The doctor may also order other tests such as blood test, urine test, cholesterol test, Electrocardiogram (ECG), treadmill stress test, 2D Echo, and coronary angiogram to check for the cause and for more signs of heart disease.Treatment and lifestyle changes can help control high blood pressure to reduce the risk of life-threatening complications.HIGH blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, the two leading causes of death in the Philippines. The good news is high blood pressure can be prevented or reduced and treated through early diagnosis and heart-healthy lifestyle changes.Dr. Cinco said it is important to stop smoking. If one does not smoke, do not start.“Smoking has 100 percent harm and zero benefit.”Stick to a healthy diet. To help manage blood pressure, avoid fast food, limit the amount of (salt) and increase the amount of in your diet.“If you want to research about healthy diet, you can check the Mediterranean diet and Okinawan diet,” said Dr. Cinco.Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure. Dr. Cinco said the exercise target is usually 10,000 steps in a day or 150 minutes of exercise or more a week.DR. CINCO who is the current president of the Philippine Heart Association (PHA), likewise shared PHA’s “Let’s do 52100 daily” movement or five servings of vegetables and fruits, two grams sodium or less than one teaspoon of salt, one hour of exercise, zero smoking, and zero sugary drinks.The Heart Essentials virtual lay forum was part of TMC Cardiovascular Institute’s week-long celebration of Heart Week 2023 with the theme “The Heart in Synchrony: Multidisciplinary Care for the Cardiac Patient.”Among the other activities were Basic Life Support Training for the Lay conducted on February 23, 2023 in Brgy. San Antonio, Pasig City; CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) Training and AED (automated external defibrillator) Awareness at the foyer of TMC Ortigas; free BP taking at the TMC lobby, and the Iron Heart competition.In the Iron Heart Competition, employees, medical trainees, and consultants compete via a stress test to promote and spread awareness on overall heart health. The competitions were held on February 10, 17, and 24, 2023.To inquire about the services of TMC Cardiovascular Institute, call 8999-1000/ 8988-7000 ext. 6314."

This is equivalent to about 60,000 deaths prevented in 2022 alone. That’s a lot of lives saved, more than I think the medical community could think of saving in our lifetime, but it’s something our legislators did just by signing a law—they saved lives.”This was the statement of Dr. Antonio Dans, clinical epidemiologist from the UP College of Medicine, on behalf of the Sin Tax Coalition, at the anniversary of the Sin Tax Reform Law or Republic Act 10351, held from January 19-20, 2023, at the Edsa Shangri-la Manila.The broad coalition of civil society reformers that worked together to legislate an unprecedented number of sin tax increases came together to celebrate the reforms’ gains.December 2022 marked the tenth year since the signing of the landmark Sin Tax Reform Law, which was followed by a tobacco and alcohol tax increase in the TRAIN Law in 2017, another increase in taxes on tobacco and an introduction of taxes on e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products in 2019 through RA 11346, and an increase in taxes on alcohol, e-cigarettes, and heated tobacco products in 2020 through RA 11467.Tobacco tax champions from the Aquino and Duterte administrations, including former Secretaries of Health Dr. Enrique Ona and Dr. Francisco Duque III, and former Secretaries of Finance Cesar Purisima and Carlos Dominguez, were recognized for their instrumental roles in the tax increases which successfully tripled the budget of the Department of Health since 2012 levels and played an integral role in the Philippines’ credit rating upgrade in 2013.The World Health Organization commended the group for the reforms which lowered smoking prevalence rates from 30 percent in 2009, before the reform, to 19.5 percent in 2021. These statistics indicate that the reform successfully raised prices on cigarettes, prevented new smokers from initiating smoking habits, and made current smokers quit."
https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/02/09/private-sector-defers-vax-procurement-pushes-for-cpr-to-ensure-availability/,Private sector defers vax procurement; pushes for CPR to ensure availability,"THE private sector is pushing pharmaceutical companies to apply for a Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) in order to make Covid-19 vaccines available to the public.This was the statement of Go Negosyo Founder Joey Concepcion in response to a call for the business community to forego its plan on purchasing new vaccines meant to counter the stronger variants of Omicron.Department of Health (DOH) officer-in-charge Dr. Maria Rosario Vergeire recently made an appeal for businesses to refrain from procuring them as they may lead more waste.“The private sector will no longer buy bivalent vaccines. This is not anymore in step with the waning demand because people believe they already have natural immunity,” the entrepreneurial czar said, while citing that vaccinations will be voluntary.“What we are saying is that the pharmaceutical companies should be encouraged to apply for CPRs so that they can be made available to the public, the same way that vaccines for pneumonia and shingles are readily available at the pharmacies,” he added. Concepcion assured Dr. Vergeire that even if there will not be any procurement of the updated booster soon from the private sector, he hopes that such Covid-19 vaccine can become one of the regular vaccines in the country before 2023 ends.“What we are looking at is the situation down the road, when we will need to renew our booster shots, like we do for the flu, and this is when people should have access to the Covid-19 vaccines. We see this happening toward the end of the year, and maybe this will be a time when people will pay for their vaccines and the government doesn’t need to buy it anymore,” he said.LAST February 6, Dr. Vergeire bared that around 26 million Covid jabs remain unused, 16 million doses of which are kept in the national warehouse, while 10 million are already distributed to different local government units. Such figure is on top of the 24 million doses that have already expired.“I agree that there is enough supply for the government; there is no issue there. We also are aware of the wastage and I believe we should save our taxpayers’ money for other things, like helping our economy become stronger,” Concepcion said.The country may be “in a good place right now” in so far as the easing pandemic situation is concerned, “but that doesn’t mean that a CPR is no longer needed,” he pointed out.In an interview during the Laging Handa Public Briefing on Monday, the Go Negosyo founder said that the target of 1 million vaccines to be made available over-the-counter is “good enough” given the “waning interest in the vaccines because people believe they have natural immunity already.”He agreed with Dr. Vergeire that available vaccines must be used, as “donations are coming and that will be more than enough.”“But let’s give people a chance to protect themselves. We support the prioritization of the seniors, the health-care workers and those with comorbidities, but we should also look after those who may be outside of these priority groups but will nevertheless need protection,” Concepcion stressed.###Roderick L.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/02/06/why-a-new-alzheimers-drug-is-having-a-slow-us-debut/,Why a new Alzheimer’s drug is having a slow US debut,"The first drug to show that it slows Alzheimer’s is on sale, but treatment for most patients is still several months away.Two big factors behind the slow debut, experts say, are scant insurance coverage and a long setup time needed by many health systems.Patients who surmount those challenges will step to the head of the line for . Here’s a closer look.The Leqembi, from Japanese drugmaker Eisai, in early January. It’s for patients with mild or early cases of dementia tied to Alzheimer’s disease.Regulators used the FDA’s accelerated pathway, which allows drugs to launch before they’re confirmed to benefit patients. In studies, Leqembi modestly slowed the fatal disease, but doctors aren’t sure yet how that translates into things like greater independence for patients.Patients get the drug by IV every two weeks. Eisai says the company has shipped Leqembi to U.S. specialty drug distribution centers. From there, it can be delivered overnight to hospitals or medical centers.Eisai spokeswoman Libby Holman said prescriptions for the drug have been written, and they expect patients to start receiving it “very soon.”A year’s treatment will run about $26,500. Patients who can afford that without insurance will be able to start the treatment if they are deemed a candidate for Leqembi and they find a doctor and health care system prepared to help them.There are currently few options outside self-pay. Most of the patients who may be candidates for this drug are on Medicare, and the federal program’s coverage is narrow so far. It has said it will cover treatments like Leqembi only for patients enrolled in certain research trials designed to test the drug.There are no such studies currently accepting new patients.“There’s a theoretical door (to coverage) that’s completely slammed shut,” said Robert Egge, chief public policy officer for the nonprofit Alzheimer’s Association.Medicare made that coverage decision last year when another Alzheimer’s drug, Biogen’s Aduhelm, hit the market.Health insurers, which run Medicare Advantage coverage, have been sticking to that decision, said a spokesman for the trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees Medicare, said after Leqembi’s approval that its coverage stance, something the Alzheimer’s Association has urged it to do.Coverage also is likely to change if the drug receives full approval from the FDA. That could happen later this year.In the meantime, Eisai has an assistance program that provides Leqembi for free to some patients, including those on Medicare. It’s based partly on financial need.It can take anywhere from several months to more than a year for doctors to diagnose a patient and then figure out if that person is a candidate for Leqembi, according to Dr. Sarah Kremen, a neurologist with the Cedars-Sinai health system in Los Angeles.That can depend on where a patient lives and the physician’s expertise.First, a doctor must determine whether a patient has mild dementia.Then the doctor has to decide what caused the condition. It could stem from Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, a stroke or a brain injury.If it’s related to Alzheimer’s disease, doctors must determine whether the patient’s brain has an amyloid protein. The new drug aims to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s by removing that protein.After all that, some doctors may hesitate to prescribe Leqembi because they don’t have a good idea yet for how the drug will help the patient or affect their everyday life, Kremen said. They have to consider that uncertainty against the brain swelling and bleeding that can develop in patients taking it.“I think this benefit versus harm issue is going to weigh heavily,” she said.Health systems must first develop plans for delivering drugs like Leqembi before they start offering it. That can take months, although some may have started before regulators approved the drug.This planning might include training nurses on how to give the drug and making sure prescribing doctors know how to recognize candidates for it. Care providers also need a plan for how patients will be monitored once they start taking it.Patients need repeated brain scans to check for side effects.Doctors may want to know that such a plan is in place before they feel comfortable writing a prescription, Kremen noted.Hospital systems also will have to figure out how many patients might come to them for this drug and be able to cover all the costs tied to it. Those might include clinic, nursing, radiologist and pharmacy fees.“Frankly, the hospital systems are going to have to decide if they want to offer it,” Kremen said. “Is it worth the cost?”Eisai estimates that about 100,000 people will be diagnosed and eligible to receive Leqembi in the United States by 2026. Representatives of the drugmaker declined to estimate how many people might receive it this year.___"

In addition, the Santisimo Rosario Parish (UST Chapel) held a eucharistic celebration for cancer patients, survivors, and their families on Saturday, February 4. UST also streamed a cancer awareness talk show “Lifeline” consisting of a panel of cancer specialists and researchers as guest speakers. One of the speakers was also a cancer survivor himself. One of the speakers Julie Ann R. Tapispisan, MD said that cancer is curable as long as it is in the early stage and treated early. The oncologist added that there is still hope for stage 4 patients. Tapispisan assured, “Don’t lose hope because there are so many new drugs in the market that we can give to our patients.” Cancer survivor Asst. Prof. Enrico M. Yambao, MSc addressed cancer patients, saying, “Just be prepared spiritually, and make sure that you know how to accept wholeheartedly whatever will be the consequences of cancer and its treatment.” Meanwhile, Prof. Pia Marie S.P. Albano, PhD wishes the youth who are considering a career in the sciences to consider cancer research in the Philippines. “Konti pa lang kami doing this kind of research in the Philippines,” Albano said. “And I hope that in the future generations will also want to do a (cancer) research like what I am doing right now.” Albano also addressed the government, wishing they would fund and further support cancer research in the country. UST Secretary-General Rev. Fr. Louie Coronal, O.P., EHL, said, “May we encourage all units to creatively promote interdisciplinary discussions, formal and informal, that would genuinely raise awareness and education about cancer towards a call for more action.” “Lifeline” is available for streaming on the official UST Facebook page and the UST Tiger TV page. It was live-streamed last Friday, February 3. 2022-2024 World Cancer Day’s theme is “Close the Care Gap.” This year’s main objective is celebrating progress and enabling more people to seek treatment.

https://businessmirror.com.ph/2023/02/02/support-and-love-are-key-ingredients-in-raising-consciousness-about-autism/,Support and love are key ingredients in raising consciousness about autism,"THERE is much debate when it comes to identifying autism, more professionally called as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While some call it a neurodevelopmental situation, there are those who look at it simply as sort of neurodiversity.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about one percent of the world’s population, or about 75 million, has ASD, and one in every 44 children in the US. It also cited that the country where diagnosed autism is highest is in Qatar, with France having the lowest rate.On the other hand, the Philippines is listed at 121st in terms of prevalence, registering 81.80 per 10,000 children, according to worldpopulationreview.com’s autism rates per country.But how should people, especially parents, deal with their kids who have ASD? Unfortunately, some people do not even know how to identify one with ASD.THE CDC said recognizing some of the early warning signs of ASD is important to know when to screen or further evaluate children, and how to counsel families of the situation. Some of these signs, it said, involve a “child’s social skills, communication, and restricted or repetitive patterns of behaviors, interests, activities, and emotional regulation.”There is no set age when ASD will manifest. The CDC pointed out that diagnosing ASD can be difficult because it can’t be detected or diagnosed by a mere blood test. “Doctors look at the child’s developmental history and behavior to make a diagnosis. ASD can sometimes be detected at 18 months of age or younger,” the CDC pointed out.Diagnosing for ASD has several steps in this process such as developmental monitoring, screening, and diagnosis, and each step is vital. “The results of a formal developmental evaluation can also inform whether your child needs early intervention services. In some cases, the specialist might recommend genetic counseling and testing for your child,” the CDC explained.SUPPORT for children diagnosed with ASD is not lost in the country, particularly among non-governmental organizations and some corporate institutions who continue to find ways to facilitate meaningful conversations on various issues concerning autism concerns.One such way is the holding of “AOK Pilipinas, Live!,” whose theme was “Building a Nation Powered by Transformative Autism-inclusive Innovation,” and was organized by the Autism Society Philippines (ASP), SM Cares, a division of SM Foundation and the corporate social responsibility arm of SM Supermalls, the Mandaluyong City government, and the National Council on Disability Affairs (NCDA), in observance of the 27th National Autism Consciousness Week.Guests and panelists included Komunidad ng Pamilya, Pasyente at persons with Disabilities (P3PWD) party list representative, Rowena Guanzon; ASP Chair Emerita Dang Koe; ASP National President Mona Magno-Veluz; former Mandaluyong City councilor Charisse Abalos-Vargas; QC Kabahagi Center Executive Director Karen Sagun; Leonard Cheshire Disability Philippines Foundation Executive Director Hazel Borja; and SM Supermalls Assistant Vice President Richard Caluyo, and SM Supermalls Senior Vice President Engr. Bien Mateo.Autism awareness advocates such as Troy Montero, Aubrey Miles, and Candy Pangilinan, who are also proud parents of children with autism, were also present and shared some of the ideas and experiences in rearing a child with autism.The group focused on the importance of innovation in addressing issues concerning people on the spectrum, while Montero, Miles, and Pangilinan also shared useful tips for other parents living with family members with autism. The panelists also expressed their support for other parents who are taking care of children who have autism and assured them that support is available if and when they need it.Pangilinan assured that everything will be okay and advised other parents not to treat autism as a burden. She also said one concern parents of a child diagnosed with autism should look at is how to secure the child’s future.“Conditioning the mind was key for me, where I had to explain several things and should be done in the simplest of terms that the child would understand. Exposing the child to various people and environments is also important to allow him or her to learn on their own, and even determine their interests in life,” Pangilinan stressed.For Montero, he feels hopeful for the future in the country, “for your children, our children. Just look around. There is so much support. I just wanted you to know that you are not alone.”As for Miles, determining the interests of a child diagnosed with autism is also a key strategy, just like for their four-year-old daughter Rocket, who has shown interests in weather, news and music.For his part, Mateo thanked the ASP for always believing in the advocacies of SM Cares, while reiterating that SM malls welcome all, living with disability or not. “We want to send the message to all our mall-goers, including people with autism, that you’re always welcome at SM.”Image credits:"

Creating a supportive partnership between the public and private sectors to address these types of diseases is strategic as we can make this a legacy for the next generation,” Magalong said during his speech.Roche (Philippines) Inc. Pharmaceuticals Division General Manager Dr. Diana Edralin looks forward to the future success of the Baguio City pilot program, hoping that the Baguio model can help support the Department of Health in its national disease strategy.“Project ECHO in Baguio City will also serve as a champion in professionalizing the role of our Barangay Health Workers and elevating their part in our patient navigation program.Baguio City’s shining example can be used as a framework for other communities to improve the care and referral pathway from the community to the regional and national levels,” Dr. Edralin said.The Baguio launch was well-attended by supportive Baguio community leaders, groups, and institutions, which included the Baguio Sangguniang Panlungsod, Baguio City Health Office Team, different private Baguio hospitals, representatives from the DOH and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), and patient groups like Minda’s Buddies.Roche (Philippines) Inc., through Project ECHO, will continue to collaborate with stakeholders who recognize the shared responsibilities of solving health-care inequities and #ClosingTheCancerCareGap."
